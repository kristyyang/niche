The campus is gorgeous with first class facilities, all the coaches that I've met are great as well as the professors and the all around feeling I get when I'm on campus is amazing. The students there have been super helpful to me with any questions I've had so far and seem like great people that I can't wait to be around for the next four years. All in all Dallas Baptist University is a lovely place with a great campus and even better people and I'm super excited I picked them to be the place I spend the next four years at.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2018-04-13T14:55:12.076839Z","guid":"20528f82-cd79-4039-86d2-c517872257b0","rating":5},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":3.33}],"photos":{"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-96.947006,32.710017,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-96.947006,32.710017,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.911664779161948,"count":883},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Dallas, TX"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/dallas-baptist-university/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"2c61d1b3-13b0-45db-87df-f3df02787d3a","badge":{"display":"Best Colleges for Music in America","ordinal":52,"total":133,"vanityURL":"best-colleges-for-music"},"content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"University of Denver","type":"College","url":"university-of-denver"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.5347},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":32940},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"1110-1310"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Freshman","body":"The extra opportunities at DU are fantastic!

The variety of clubs and diversity of the university allows students to feel included and involved. There is a wide spectrum of majors and minors. Everything from gender studies to Chinese culture! The university of Houston has many amenities that may benefit residential and commuting students such as a recreational center, three different food courts, an eight floor library, and three tutoring centers!

What drew to the school was   its affordability, as well as, the diversity. The campus includes a broad range of students, but even though many are from different backgrounds, the campus has the ability of bringing everyone together. While living on campus, I have never felt more safe, safety is a top priority for the school and I am proud to call myself an eagle. The resources available on school are simply amazing, so you should never feel behind on anything course related. For the future, I am considering on continuing with a graduate academic career in the near future at UNT.

I felt very at home at Stetson, and greatly appreciate the time that I spent there.\nOver the past few years, there have been a few administrative decisions that have been questionable, such as unusual aesthetic additions and a large enrollment increase without sufficient housing opportunities.

It is a gorgeous campus. It also has an amazing staff who take the time to know you well. It is a Southern Baptist school, so most of the students have more conservative values although they are not insanely conservative and are very open minded to the ideas of other individuals. Samford is also located in a nice area of Birmingham, AL that offers enough fun to try something new every weekend. The area also contains many healthy churches that can enrich your college experience ten-fold.\nThere are some pitfalls. The diversity here is a bit pitiful and the conservative atmosphere of the school may also be suffocating to certain individuals. Parties are fairly few and far between. However, it is easy to find other places in Birmingham to party or dance if you are looking for that sort of scene.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2018-01-19T18:22:13.325725Z","guid":"b798cac4-162b-4396-9ee9-bb303e73ad0f","rating":5},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":3.66}],"photos":{"default":{"crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/15fccd3ac6b7a2c2969729c22316a789adc3748f.jpg","MobileHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/8ad7f28e75dee67d79ce128d598ad4705f4728f3.jpg"},"licenseName":"UNLICENSED"},"mapbox_header":{"crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-86.790932,33.464578,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-86.790932,33.464578,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"UNLICENSED"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.7466666666666666,"count":675},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Birmingham, AL"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/samford-university/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"8cf2850c-e7b4-4c0e-b3ca-0fcbc623cf1c","content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"SUNY Purchase College","type":"College","url":"suny-purchase-college"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.4351},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":18123},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"970-1180"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Senior","body":"I loved my time at Purchase College!
