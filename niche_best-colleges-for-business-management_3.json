Amazing location amazing academics and environment. I literally can’t stop talking about this school with friends and family haha i’m obsessed. The core values of course are really what set it apart from the other 5cs and I feel that pitzer deserves more of a personal identity apart from the other colleges. It deserves much more individual recognition because it really is such a unique educational establishment. I am so lucky I go here and recommend it to anyone who is really looking to go to school with passionate and brilliant peers. The food is incredible of course and they’re super accommodating to vegans (my personal dietary restriction). Claremont is an adorable charming city and a comfortable distance from LA.

The classes are interesting, challenging, and rewarding. The professors are passionate about what they teach and really care if students understand the material. It's not just about the grades at this university, it truly is about learning information and expanding your knowledge. The location is great as well. A safe small town that still is full of fun activities to keep students occupied on the weekends. Another great part of Bucknell is that it is a liberal science university. I can major in biology, but also take art or dance classes if I want. It's overall a great place and I'm very happy with my choice to attend.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2018-06-07T21:12:46.516604Z","guid":"702fd12f-7dcf-4140-b474-9ac750a2e8d5","rating":5},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":4.33}],"photos":{"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-76.886275,40.954489,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-76.886275,40.954489,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.672316384180791,"count":708},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Lewisburg, PA"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/bucknell-university/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"6fc3bda8-3fc1-432a-bb6d-7aeb8e83610a","badge":{"display":"Best Colleges for Business in America","ordinal":53,"total":1020,"vanityURL":"best-colleges-for-business"},"content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":true,"isPremium":false,"name":"California Polytechnic State University - San Luis Obispo","type":"College","url":"california-polytechnic-state-university---san-luis-obispo"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.2949},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":18530},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"1150-1360"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Sophomore","body":"Cal Poly SLO is known for their great engineer and agriculture programs. The professors are knowledgable and with a smaller campus and small class sizes, you can really get the attention and help you need from your professors. However, Cal Poly struggles with diversity. There are some programs directed to making prospective students of color feel more welcome (such as Poly Cultural Weekend) but overall, people of color make up less than half of the student body. There is even less people of color apart of Cal Poly's faculty. The lack of diversity is also apparent in the town, not just on campus.  If you are coming from a big city to San Luis Obispo, Cal Poly will be a big change. Since it is such a smaller, quieter area, there is not much to do here, especially if you're under 21. That being said, there are a lot of places to hike and hammock if you're a nature lover! The Farmers Market on Thursdays are a popular spot and attract many residents. The beaches are beautiful.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2018-03-17T01:44:31.222074Z","guid":"9ff1f622-a6e1-446a-a07d-cb47c5a415e5","rating":4},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":4}],"photos":{"default":{"crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/d616af4cad52b01bbd8dd743a1d9e0ce6ae6f812.jpg","MobileHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/aca929811f06f81522da2dd062f12da6e2a1c0c7.jpg","Thumbnail":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/1f9a259894aa3b00a7947ed85418992f32b03688"},"licenseName":"UNLICENSED"},"mapbox_header":{"crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-120.65856,35.29889,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-120.65856,35.29889,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"UNLICENSED"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.6969783352337515,"count":3508},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"San Luis Obispo, CA"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/california-polytechnic-state-university---san-luis-obispo/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"54372752-4eb0-4df3-9c9b-afda7e80d16d","badge":{"display":"Best Colleges for Business in America","ordinal":54,"total":1020,"vanityURL":"best-colleges-for-business"},"content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":true,"isPremium":false,"name":"Franklin & Marshall College","type":"College","url":"franklin--and--marshall-college"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.3637},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":23182},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"1200-1420"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Freshman","body":"I came here for the music program and the astrophysics program.

There isn't a huge multicultural greek life presence and school bus system could be run slightly better.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2018-03-12T10:59:57.845228Z","guid":"579a3fec-e190-4e34-afd7-b6c4932c7513","rating":4},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":4.33}],"photos":{"default":{"author":"breathindigital","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/34b1fb74cb2764087d78426bbca682cc3f5447e2.jpg","MobileHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/653738e4cac9b211c5c5bc11ce2e330a17f86cba.jpg","Thumbnail":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/fe532bf7e289edf987ca9c8a371bedb5cc627aa3"},"licenseName":"CC BY-SA","licenseUrl":"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/","sourceUrl":"https://www.flickr.com/photos/breatheindigital/8695462255/"},"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-77.631042,43.126437,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-77.631042,43.126437,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.607621736062103,"count":1417},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Rochester, NY"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/university-of-rochester/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"a08a99fb-b3a5-4b4a-86f3-167d77a9b2ac","badge":{"display":"Best Colleges for Business in America","ordinal":57,"total":1020,"vanityURL":"best-colleges-for-business"},"content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":true,"isPremium":false,"name":"Chapman University","type":"College","url":"chapman-university"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.5403},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":40709},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"1110-1300"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Junior","body":"I love Chapman!

I also love the atmosphere of the school, and the fact that you can see people you know all the time. It's also great that you can always find a place to fit in. There's something for everyone if you seek it out. Additionally, I have been blessed with fantastic work and internship opportunities from this school, which are extremely valuable. However, athletics are not a huge priority for the school, which is slightly a bummer. I am an athlete at Chapman and I would definitely love to see more student support of athletics. What's great is that the student athletes and athletic directors have been very proactive about this. They are working hard to draw more support for all teams and make athletics more inclusive.

Overall MSU is a great school and should be one of your top choices!","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2018-05-05T20:27:17.49387Z","guid":"74727688-4301-4279-a34e-c4402c0f5d27","rating":4},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":4.33}],"photos":{"default":{"crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/3c86cb5ecb796fb02f00131e78e91c570bb305e7.jpg","MobileHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/d9e1f794feaf7d40a563d4afadc590a1ee11aca1.jpg","Thumbnail":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/bfda4f1b300ee36d4f810daa740dd5acd682ae77"},"licenseName":"UNLICENSED"},"mapbox_header":{"crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-84.473639,42.72476,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-84.473639,42.72476,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"UNLICENSED"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.8049067713444553,"count":5095},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"East Lansing, MI"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/michigan-state-university/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"c3ea35a9-85d8-473b-a511-4f7d71c3b78e","badge":{"display":"Best Colleges for Business in America","ordinal":64,"total":1020,"vanityURL":"best-colleges-for-business"},"content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":true,"isPremium":false,"name":"North Carolina State University","type":"College","url":"north-carolina-state-university"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.4751},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":13066},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"1170-1350"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Junior","body":"One thing that I love about North Carolina State University is the amount of diversity and school pride here on campus. The people here at State are so welcoming and friendly towards one another that it is easy to find someone to study with, party with, or just become friends with overall. I think NCSU has one of the best engineering and communication programs here on campus and they also have a lot of resources at our libraries and everywhere else on campus. Their database is incredible and the library has so much information for you to refer to when doing research or completing an essay. This University has a strong reputation of academic success as well competitive students, which is makes our school very exciting. Each student is engaged and passionate about something and NC State encourages that each student pursue those goals. I highly recommend NC State as a college to consider in your future!","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2018-01-30T01:58:15.474898Z","guid":"e84e9514-2034-4a0d-a91e-0c1d31aeae71","rating":5},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":4.33}],"photos":{"default":{"crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/0d5e2c003b13d2769307336bd655857bac2982b6.jpg","MobileHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/c517c2cd19633a88a57d9c970f1239b3366f8ffe.jpg","Thumbnail":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/e67659770e0ba5c72887fe9d5a16cd61a6737abc"},"licenseName":"UNLICENSED"},"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-78.674517,35.785111,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-78.674517,35.785111,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.748632010943912,"count":2924},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Raleigh, NC"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/north-carolina-state-university/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"94e9c220-e7d8-464d-a9fa-505420b03862","badge":{"display":"Best Colleges for Business in America","ordinal":65,"total":1020,"vanityURL":"best-colleges-for-business"},"content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":true,"isPremium":false,"name":"Stevens Institute of Technology","type":"College","url":"stevens-institute-of-technology"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.3911},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":37168},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"1260-1440"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Niche User","body":"Stevens is an amazing campus, it is my dream college!

This school allowed me to grow as a person both personally and professionally.\nThis school does have its flaws. It really needs to work on protecting its students against sexual violence.

Day in and day out, there are a multitude of franchises to dine in or out at. In the \"Grease Pit\", on the opposite side of the high way lining campus, there are more fast-food restaurants than you could even count on all your fingers and toes. In addition to the campus life and eateries, Baylor is the only university also certified as a zoo. With the two live bears, Joy and Lady, the campus is lit up by their presence as true mascots.
