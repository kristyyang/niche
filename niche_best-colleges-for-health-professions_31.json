I have small class sizes, so one on one with the professor is easy. What makes my school unique is how hands on we are in our classrooms and curriculum. our courses aren't strictly lecture based, actually they rarely are. My classes are really interactive and offer flexibility in your learning style.  I would definitely choose my school if i could do it all over again, the only thing i would change would the orientation offered at the school was somewhat difficult for me. Because my school is outdoor based and environmentally conscious, out orientation is a three week backpacking trip that I wasn't nearly prepared for. But otherwise our classes are really informative and after we learn as much as we can we go outside or act out what we learned in real life whether its about math, animal behavior or sciences.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2015-09-09T13:52:55Z","guid":"7a62c359-57c1-4817-a417-70bff762a464","rating":5},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":2.66}],"photos":{"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-112.476509,34.5445,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-112.476509,34.5445,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.618320610687023,"count":262},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Prescott, AZ"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/prescott-college/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"7b6e77c2-cf94-4c4a-bd02-444c70fbacf5","content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"Andrew College","type":"College","url":"andrew-college"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":1},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":18095},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"600-920"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Freshman","body":"This School offers a lot of programs to study.Also, it has a high level of academic support to help succeed.

It has provided me with the right tools I need to sharpen my skills in my field of choice (Nursing).  There has been many opportunities to learn more ways of improving my crafts as a result of my time in school, and for that I am truly grateful. For example, the assistance provided during clinicals from all the nurses has been remarkable—allotting us students all that they know in attempts to create the best future nurses. If anything can change, I would like to eventually see more professors teaching here at this school. For what the school has, they do an awesome job. However, if provided more staff, it will reduce the stress load drastically which will create an even better environment overall. Ultimately, I’ve come to find out that going to college is as much about finding out who you really are as it is about getting that degree and the college you attend truly does matter.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2018-01-11T05:04:28.499055Z","guid":"9442c997-586f-4c0c-a4f6-c1c00c18e761","rating":4},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade"}],"photos":{"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-73.201106,41.201198,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-73.201106,41.201198,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.4,"count":35},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Bridgeport, CT"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/st-vincents-college---connecticut/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"e6b97d1d-d6c0-4927-8087-c06e7755aa5b","content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"Carolinas College of Health Sciences","type":"College","url":"carolinas-college-of-health-sciences"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.3095},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":21895},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"1010-1070"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Sophomore","body":"I currently attend Carolinas College of Health Sciences. As an individual trying to obtain their second degree I find this school to be the perfect fit. It is small and close knit environment. Each of the staff members are friendly, reliable, and knowledgable. If they don't know the answer to something they do not hesitate to inform you of that, but will do everything in their power to help you obtain that answer. The instructors work very hard to help you achieve success. You will work hard, no matter what program you are in, but I can guarantee you, you will feel more than prepared in your field.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2017-07-21T02:54:32.399929Z","guid":"4f24d923-9b6b-4fa1-bcb3-1c64f9c586ee","rating":5},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade"}],"photos":{"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-80.838535,35.200295,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-80.838535,35.200295,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":4.407407407407407,"count":27},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"2 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Charlotte, NC"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/carolinas-college-of-health-sciences/#scatterplot"}}]}
