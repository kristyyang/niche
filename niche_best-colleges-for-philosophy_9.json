I love being surrounded by nature and having tons of local wineries and breweries close by. The party seen at this school is pretty good and has a strong tradition here.

A friend of mine had Celiac Disease freshman year and I was amazed to see how much they provided for her so that she could feel comfortable eating. She told me that they even have allergy kitchens on both sides of the dining halls!

How many interns can say that? It has also allowed me to develop very strong leadership skills and the ability to work in teams. This school allowed me to grow as a person both personally and professionally.\nThis school does have its flaws. It really needs to work on protecting its students against sexual violence. Not enough has been done, and in this day and age, more needs to be done. GWU is quite expensive, and even though they have good financial aid, they don't provide enough dining dollars to last a semester and that makes getting food a struggle at times.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2018-04-28T01:48:31.229879Z","guid":"354e6e50-c870-4bc6-a741-1a1713999b50","rating":5},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":4}],"photos":{"default":{"author":"taedc","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/6b3620674c0af07db6f502a92844050c136530f0.jpg","MobileHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/881ee2057b5e573c7eabaedf066f8299c9b92c8a.jpg","Thumbnail":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/0a3743d91b38861921a60726bf869dce2ec8b589"},"licenseName":"CC BY-SA","licenseUrl":"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/","sourceUrl":"https://www.flickr.com/photos/taedc/14350595171/"},"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-77.047871,38.89865,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-77.047871,38.89865,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.571353894406691,"count":1913},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Washington, DC"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/george-washington-university/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"f7397325-1b91-4a7c-a3d6-eaa23fd294ae","content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"University of Miami","type":"College","url":"university-of-miami"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.3771},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":37424},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"1210-1390"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Freshman","body":"Coral Gables is home to the University of Miami, an elite university, known commonly as “The U.” With its perpetual sunshine and swaying palm trees, the University of Miami enjoys the cool ambience of the tropics, while also holding the title of a Top 50 school.

There are plenty of programs that are there to help if you are struggling outside and inside of the school. There are also rewards for students who maintain a GPA of 3.0 and above as well as programs that recognizes students who are not quite at the 3.0 mark bug still shows their ambition to succeed.

The only downside is the construction that's going on right now, but it is to improve some of the older hallways.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2017-10-17T20:03:18.350952Z","guid":"5da2d139-a376-49d1-aa58-6946e027cac1","rating":5},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":3.33}],"photos":{"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-71.325081,42.65372,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-71.325081,42.65372,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.5735950044603033,"count":1121},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Lowell, MA"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/university-of-massachusetts---lowell/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"08e4512d-1b69-4961-b165-881c7fb2b953","content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":true,"isPremium":false,"name":"Indiana University of Pennsylvania","type":"College","url":"indiana-university-of-pennsylvania"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.9154},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":17264},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"840-1050"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Graduate Student","body":"The Indiana University of Pennsylvania (IUP) is a wonderful institution for higher education.

The university aims to have a very diverse community of faculty and students, which it successfully accomplishes through its various academic programs and events.  The university is nestled in the small city of Indiana, Pennsylvania.

One problem I do I have is with the parking situations, there is hardly any parking.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2018-04-30T19:51:02.422179Z","guid":"3e935fe3-ada3-4ee6-885c-384ba5f0b035","rating":4},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":3}],"photos":{"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-88.18189,30.695081,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-88.18189,30.695081,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.668091168091168,"count":1404},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Mobile, AL"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/university-of-south-alabama/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"83e76554-2efd-4672-8e50-c05413c8cf4d","content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"CUNY College of Staten Island","type":"College","url":"cuny-college-of-staten-island"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.9916},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":10627},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"910-1100"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Freshman","body":"I love that the school is extremely diverse, and that the staff is caring and engaged.

Every semester the school creates a new way to include its students from all walks of life. There are many organizations that are eager to gain new recruits; there are always emails and chalk drawings that invite people to join the UMBC community or show your Retriever Pride; and there are so many safe, private places to study or just relax without feeling like you're in the middle of nowhere.\nNot to mention you are a short bus-ride away from plenty of off-campus attractions, if you ever feel the need to escape campus life (many of these excursions are even organized by  the Student Events Board). \nThis is the perfect small campus, with a big college feel.

While it is so different in many ways, you are able to bring your own uniqueness to UAB and become apart of their family. They encourage and accept all types of individuals in order to not only support the students attending the school, but support the future of the world. With UAB being able to accept and welcome such a diverse group of individuals it only benefits them more and continues to grow their success, because they learn from each other and grow with each other, making their goal to better society as one family.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2018-05-17T05:55:01.065574Z","guid":"4f54ee84-8dc2-4f65-911f-51a601cb47ff","rating":5},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":4}],"photos":{"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-86.80917,33.50223,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-86.80917,33.50223,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.7142116182572615,"count":1928},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Birmingham, AL"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/university-of-alabama---birmingham/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"728b6641-05b9-4940-a922-f17186f46c5a","content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"University of Tennessee - Chattanooga","type":"College","url":"university-of-tennessee---chattanooga"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.7826},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":14559},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"920-1190"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Junior","body":"I've had a pretty solid experience so far at UTC. Started in the dorms my freshman year and eventually moving off campus, everything is walkable (including downtown), there is a ton of nightlife, and the resources available to students is pretty phenomenal. Parking is awful - best to buy parking passes well in advance and don't expect to find anything if you're coming from off campus - but the nursing program is stellar and really competitive, as are most of the programs there. I highly recommend because of the size (big enough that you'll meet a lot of people, small enough that you'll feel known in your classes - most are 25-100 people) and the location and price - you can't beat the dorms!","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2017-12-27T23:49:16.69583Z","guid":"1e7538d9-136a-443f-8cea-36b24e593c75","rating":4},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":2.66}],"photos":{"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-85.299812,35.048247,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-85.299812,35.048247,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.556716417910448,"count":1340},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Chattanooga, TN"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/university-of-tennessee---chattanooga/#scatterplot"}}]}
