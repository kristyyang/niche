The campus offers a calm and friendly scene while promoting cultural and international affairs.  The current economic crisis has impacted the students, making them more knowledgeable in politics and economics, while raising new activists who speak up for those who do not have the needed courage.   The curriculums are exquisite for those who want to learn more about social studies and humanities while majoring in medicine, communications, entrepreneurship, and others.  I highly recommend the public University for those who want to learn about Caribbean studies, natural sciences, and linguistics.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2018-05-14T18:16:14.612966Z","guid":"1088835f-b98c-484e-97c2-8e0f61d0a4c0","rating":4},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade"}],"photos":{"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-66.045875,18.403027,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-66.045875,18.403027,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.5181159420289854,"count":552},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1"},{"label":"TaglineFact2"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/university-of-puerto-rico---rio-piedras/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"e1774b8d-9d2a-4449-ac65-86a25cbd22b7","content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"Wayne State University","type":"College","url":"wayne-state-university"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.8146},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":11910},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"983-1260"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Niche User","body":"I really enjoyed Wayne State.

If you can take a class with Eric Ash you will love it! Places around campus to eat at we’re all decently priced and great food. I commuted so I’m not sure how on campus food is.

The campus is absolutely stunning with its mixture of  up-to-date academic buildings, alongside historic buildings that have been standing since the incorporation of the university.  The university aims to have a very diverse community of faculty and students, which it successfully accomplishes through its various academic programs and events.  The university is nestled in the small city of Indiana, Pennsylvania.  There are plenty of restaurants, shops, and bars along Philadelphia Street to keep students entertained in the evenings and on the weekends.

Staff are always willing to help students and make them feel like they're at home. Professors are approachable and are always willing to hear what you have to say. There's tremendously unique experiences that NMSU provides for students. Aside from experiences there's also different kind of activities and organizations where I can find a perfect match to what I like to do and people just get to collaborate with one another. There's over 180+ degrees in NMSU to pick from and just the fact that they had the perfect match to the degree that I wanted to pursue. A couple of things that I think the campus needs to work on is the dorms on campus, there's always something negative that's happening whether is the water, undistinguished smells, door locks.

Do. Make a Difference. That is the motto of my current college, St. Cloud State University. Here, the professors genuinely enjoy the field that they were teaching and want their students to succeed in it, too. Within the first month of the 2016-2017 academic school year, there have been a number of different events for students to attend in which they can meet other students, enjoy free activities, and have an involvement on campus. As recently reported on the news, my community has recently undergone a traumatic occurrence at the local mall ten minutes away. Eight people were stabbed, none of which were students at the university, and the assailant was killed on site. Since this, the community has really come together to work through this difficult time. Within the past few days, the school has offered many opportunities for gatherings in which students and faculty could find some light in this time of darkness. The school genuinely cares. I would recommend this school to anyone looking for an affordable, amazing college experience. St. Cloud State University is a school that I would choose time and time again. Go, Huskies!","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2016-09-21T12:33:08Z","guid":"ea2efba9-930b-41d2-bcdd-0d2cfc907a32","rating":4},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":2.66}],"photos":{"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-94.153,45.552418,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-94.153,45.552418,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.450623202301055,"count":1043},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Saint Cloud, MN"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/st-cloud-state-university/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"b13ffea8-7ed5-4389-b870-029bb8559596","content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"University of North Dakota","type":"College","url":"university-of-north-dakota"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.8369},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":14693},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"960-1190"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Graduate Student","body":"I am in my last semester of the UND Special Ed online masters program before my internship and then graduation next semester. I have truly enjoyed the courses I have taken as I am learning so much valuable information that I can apply to my career. I enjoyed analyzing the characteristics of students with learning disabilities and the various approaches and methods used to foster ideal learning environments in the classroom. I had the opportunity to learn from professors who exemplify what they teach, and benefited from hands on experience to implement what I have learned. My professors and the entire college are so understanding, thoughtful, and caring. They want to help you succeed and work with you. They even called me in Florida to make sure I was okay and offer extended deadlines after Hurricane Irma. This is also the cheapest, quickest way to get my degree and really learn my stuff so I can be the most educated, experienced, and effective educator I can be.

Class sizes are relatively small the professor to student ratio is about 14:1. Small classes allow students to get he individual help that they might need or want. The educational benefits of YSU are amazing for a same state university. \nAlthough, there are somethings I would like to see change. There are not a lot of students that live on campus, there are only three dorm buildings in total. It almost feels like a commuter school in the sense that there are a lot of students that just go to class and then drive home. Weekends are very quiet and there aren't a lot of parties going on mostly because of the lack of students on campus. But, there is some change happening! YSU is building new apartment building the students can stay in. There are three apartment complexes around campus, University Edge, University Courtyards and they are build The Enclave.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2018-01-24T01:32:35.918307Z","guid":"78d2a013-3d7d-4c4b-9ed7-008f4de5ba5f","rating":4},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":2.66}],"photos":{"default":{"crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/ec6d071a1123c50daa4893e11be6a754c68ade5e.jpg","MobileHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/54a7fa7d83aa7f5def609bf299c699913f1ec09f.jpg"},"licenseName":"UNLICENSED"},"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-80.646515,41.105583,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-80.646515,41.105583,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.4008264462809916,"count":1210},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Youngstown, OH"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/youngstown-state-university/#scatterplot"}}]}
