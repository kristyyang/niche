As a freshman, Whitworth was really great with helping me adapt to the big changes that come with college. Specifically at Whitworth, I have really enjoyed the traditiation for freshmen and all the events that it contained. I really enjoyed the events on campus during weekends. I wish the price could be cheaper so that it was easier to enjoy such a great education at Whitworth. I have met great friends who would probably answer the same as me. Another improvement I think Whitworth could make is making sure that students are able to understand how to get a job once they have finished college. This might be an improvement with the advisers but I think students need help with stress and knowing we can find stable careers out of college that correspond with our majors.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2016-07-13T23:12:11Z","guid":"d41405c1-67df-4aea-88ec-c750f90fc98d","rating":4},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":3.66}],"photos":{"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-117.418078,47.753699,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-117.418078,47.753699,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.9413145539906105,"count":852},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Spokane, WA"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/whitworth-university/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"d5a8a9d2-33cc-48bb-9c90-4647317d5075","badge":{"display":"Best Colleges for Computer Science in America","ordinal":183,"total":494,"vanityURL":"best-colleges-for-computer-science"},"content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":true,"isPremium":true,"name":"Colorado State University","type":"College","url":"colorado-state-university"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.7796},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":16232},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"1020-1250"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Alum","body":"Colorado State University met all my expectations for the college I had always imagined going to for my bachelors degree. Unfortunately for me, at the time I had no clue what I wanted out of life and very little passion for the degree I had chosen to study there which was Journalism. I had no direction, no motivation, and no confidence which quickly led to my demise. Finally, over three years later, I now have realized my path and it has absolutely nothing to do with CSU or politics. I am sure it's a great school with tons to offer if you apply yourself, but to be honest I got very little out of my education there and feel like I may have waisted a lot of time and money during my 7 year stint at Colorado State University. But not regrets, it made me exactly who I am today and for that I couldn't be more grateful!","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2018-01-24T13:19:25.588126Z","guid":"4c1a3633-4983-43d2-8527-8653acab2ec5","rating":4},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":4}],"photos":{"default":{"crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/059f3d8a38eb67805acc7a36b70c9ab860309946.jpg","MobileHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/c2e664af8157db0d7187f332aa9bc2ad61d63d12.jpg"},"licenseName":"UNLICENSED"},"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-105.08083,40.574759,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-105.08083,40.574759,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.727849848192106,"count":3623},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Fort Collins, CO"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/colorado-state-university/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"256bfe72-bef3-4a32-accd-91c9306baad9","badge":{"display":"Best Colleges for Computer Science in America","ordinal":184,"total":494,"vanityURL":"best-colleges-for-computer-science"},"content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"Centre College","type":"College","url":"centre-college"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.7426},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":25519},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"1080-1340"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Freshman","body":"Centre College, being a small campus, offers a friendly atmosphere and personal connections with other students and professors.

Some downsides are the food (which isn't great) and some of the extra things that come with it being a small school. For example, registering for certain majors can be extremely difficult because of limited class options and there are less options for housing, food, and activities than on a larger campus.

About to finish my third year, I can say with certainty that my parents' money is paying off.

Professors are incredible and very easy to access outside of class.  There are also so many extracurricular activities to participate in, and if something you want is not there, it is very easy to start your own club!  The campus dining services are incredible.  Dhall is life and I would be so lost without Spa and Burgess.  Dorms and on-campus apartments are spacious and have everything you could possibly need!  I definitely made the right choice coming here.  There is no Greek life, which is awesome in my opinion.  Also, Saratoga Springs is quite possibly the most beautiful little city I have ever seen.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2017-04-29T07:19:37.052188Z","guid":"f94500b1-e292-4030-9a3b-c6f1d4c25d0a","rating":5},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":4}],"photos":{"default":{"crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/ad72f5277e4ca7e90712c9b8145a1145168a0ce2.jpg","MobileHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/2026051e4b310b6e180caee134f54593e2b98e3a.jpg"},"licenseName":"UNLICENSED"},"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-73.785108,43.092696,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-73.785108,43.092696,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.6763698630136985,"count":584},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Saratoga Springs, NY"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/skidmore-college/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"134539d5-e860-4c36-85f9-a5cc48d67109","badge":{"display":"Best Colleges for Computer Science in America","ordinal":191,"total":494,"vanityURL":"best-colleges-for-computer-science"},"content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"Texas Tech University","type":"College","url":"texas-tech-university"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.626},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":15235},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"1020-1200"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Freshman","body":"Texas Tech University is a fantastic place to go to school.

The beautiful campus is enough to make any lover of beautiful historical architecture stand in awe and admiration.  The professors are engaging, intelligent, and extremely accommodating. The food is superb! The students are thoughtful, responsible, and mature in most cases. In addition, the students for the most part prefer to engage one another in conversation rather than absorb themselves in their devices. Overall this College is the perfect place for someone who wants superb education, good friends, good food, and more, all for a very reasonable price.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2018-02-21T13:21:00.736775Z","guid":"2b17bdbd-c150-43c3-91a2-25e87dee9c2e","rating":5},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":3}],"photos":{"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-80.079836,41.157827,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-80.079836,41.157827,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.411832946635731,"count":862},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Grove City, PA"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/grove-city-college/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"9cc014a9-3692-4d88-977d-119e2d1cd45d","badge":{"display":"Best Colleges for Computer Science in America","ordinal":200,"total":494,"vanityURL":"best-colleges-for-computer-science"},"content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"Louisiana State University","type":"College","url":"louisiana-state-university"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.7639},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":15095},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"1010-1250"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Junior","body":"LSU has been the greatest experience of my life.

It's about the lasting memories you make and knowledge you gain. While it is a bit taunting to go out and enjoy the social and bar scenes around campus, OU is all about time management. It's very hard to get caught up in the fun of things and forget about academics. But it is most certainly not impossible. If students take their time here, and use the networking and resources that are available it is absolutely amazing the places you can go.

In the beginning I was uncomfortable with my transition and unable to feel at home. Through clubs and sports teams I was able to develop new friendships and life skills that made me feel more at home. There are so many opportunities presented to students at USC that all should take advantage of. One of the most important things that is clearly valued here, is academics. My professors so far have been some of the most passionate people I have met. A favorite course I have taken here has been environmental ethics. I took this course as a philosophy requirement and it inspired me to change my major to environmental studies. The professor and the course material inspired me to make a decision that I will not soon regret. I am more than happy to say that I am a student at USC. If someone decides to attend school here, I bet they will say the same thing.
