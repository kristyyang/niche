From athletes looking for competitive NCAA Division I teams, academias looking for top-notch classes with engaged professors, social butterflies looking for campus involvement and nightlife, they have something for everyone! Although Presbyterian is small, it has a large school social and athletic life, while still maintaining small class sizes so that you get the most out of every experience. The only thing I would like to see change is the food, it does leave a little to be desired on days!","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2017-04-28T03:25:42.191049Z","guid":"11df12e4-85e3-473b-983e-fb0746874265","rating":5},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":3.33}],"photos":{"default":{"crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/bd6d34bd49b2522e79d1b76a3af283c653b0319a.jpg","MobileHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/b6e3cd4f7cbd1cb4747a3027d8f0f405720a27bd.jpg"},"licenseName":"UNLICENSED"},"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-81.874408,34.465697,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-81.874408,34.465697,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.672566371681416,"count":226},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Clinton, SC"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/presbyterian-college/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"4e3513a8-2577-4121-a918-6179240c68fe","content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"William Jewell College","type":"College","url":"william-jewell-college"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.5108},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":22782},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"980-1285"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Sophomore","body":"William Jewell College is my home.

This place has changed me for the better and taught me that college is more than parties and fraternities, but actually getting to know individuals around you to grow with. I already have internships lined up thanks to my excellent accounting professors.
