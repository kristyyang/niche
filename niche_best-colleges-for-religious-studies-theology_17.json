Our small community works well together, and the relationships formed here last a lifetime and you see that through the people who come back to visit. Academically it is challenging, but the professors are willing to work alongside you. I think the best part about BBC is how spiritually centered and strong we are here. We are focused on Christ and communicating and sharing Christ, but we are also continually growing and trying to grow. Spiritual life is key at Boston Baptist and is really what helps you get through the two or four years you stay here. Boston Baptist College is a great Bible College - a great place to start learning about the ministry while also growing spiritually. So many great things about this place that I call home. This college isn't for everyone, but I urge you to check out our college further just to see what it's about!","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2016-01-05T12:27:06Z","guid":"32a8b431-a3f0-4ff0-8d56-55a85fc656b4","rating":4},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade"}],"photos":{"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-71.1103,42.254037,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-71.1103,42.254037,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.8947368421052633,"count":19},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Boston, MA"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/boston-baptist-college/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"379e891b-556d-45b6-a352-529ef0b96c1f","content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"Montana Bible College","type":"College","url":"montana-bible-college"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":1},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":11523},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"1080-1440"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Sophomore","body":"Montana Bible college is a very small school with less than one hundred students on campus. This atmosphere provides a very homey atmosphere where everybody knows everybody. Both the students and the faculty kind of become your second family. The professors and the schools' main focus is the worship of Jesus Christ and helping to train disciples for Him.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2017-08-23T15:09:21.521742Z","guid":"8314dda5-146d-4bcd-92d3-83285cf04d0a","rating":5},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade"}],"photos":{"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-111.063321,45.65582,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-111.063321,45.65582,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.5,"count":2},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Bozeman, MT"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/montana-bible-college/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"eaac959f-ce5b-4153-a732-ebb91f2c4d61","content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"Heritage Christian University","type":"College","url":"heritage-christian-university"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.3333},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":8999},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"780-1270"}],"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade"}],"photos":{"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-87.662062,34.859089,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-87.662062,34.859089,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.857142857142857,"count":7},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year (Online)"},{"label":"TaglineFact2"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/heritage-christian-university/#scatterplot"}}]}
