Also stuff like glow parties. I still have my TShirt from my freshman year of 2012. The RAs are very attentive. Jets has the greatest enployees and they help the students. There is always something going on in the Den. There is also an open door policy. If there is a door open, walk into it and say Hello!. I also love the FYE course.

If you're wondering just how close of a relationship you make with the staff at Averett - my advisor has a picture of us hanging in her office from my senior pinning, and when going through a hard time in a leadership role, the president wrote me an encouraging handwritten letter.

They won’t pursue you, you need to pursue them periodically in person to see if anything is amiss. Technology is temperamental in ways they might not even be aware of. \nAnother thing I love is their willingness to just talk with you as a person.

It was an amazing experience at the University because of the diversity of students, the campus beauty and the overall Downeast Maine atmosphere. Here I sit today going back to the University of Maine at Machias in my early 40's. I decided to change my major and return to school. I am an online student now, however I stay connected in various ways through the school. What I find the most appealing that even after all these years, the same professors are still working at the college. The school has a home like feel because of the atmosphere the campus offers. I highly recommend the University of Maine at Machias if you enjoy the outdoors, especially oceans. There may not be a lot of things to do in town because it is very rural. However, there is an abundance of outdoor activities that will be a once in a lifetime experience. Whether it exploring Jaspers Beach or The Bluff.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2017-05-23T16:50:39.013145Z","guid":"8d43d158-749c-432f-bdc9-f41d702f4fe8","rating":4},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":2.33}],"photos":{"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-67.456534,44.709895,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-67.456534,44.709895,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.2211538461538463,"count":104},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Machias, ME"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/university-of-maine-at-machias/#scatterplot"}}]}
