It tends to have a bad reputation, especially from where I come from, but I have nothing but great things to say about it.  Campus culture is very work oriented, many people here are ready to really earn their way to what they want to do.  Eastern is very community based, and that is shown in Ypsilanti, and the kind people around you.  Very diverse student body.  EMU tends to be too focused on the work at times, which is never a bad thing, but we could learn to relax.  You have to work to get the experience that you want.  Don't expect to pay tuition and love it - get involved, talk to your professors, do community service, look into study abroad, talk to your classmates, do research!

After my 1st week of classes, I let really myself experience the school -- w/o any judgements. The moment I started identifying all the positives at AU was the moment I started to love this university. The campus is gorgeous & well maintained, the staff goes above & beyond to help students, the community is so welcoming, & student-life is thriving. Everyone here is truly amazing!

Not going to lie, the surrounding city of Fitchburg is not pretty to look at but if you stay on campus, you'll be fine and enjoy yourself. Campus police takes their job very serious and make sure no one is in danger at all times. Some of the athletes here can be full of themselves but it's very easy to avoid dealing with them (unless their drunk at a party when you have to knock them out). I'd have to say the majors that Fitchburg State is most recognized for are the Exercise and Sport Science, Nursing, Film and Business. The professors here are really cool and all of them are very passionate of what they teach. Love this place, best state school in Massachusetts hands down, and I've visited many schools.\r\n\r\nProud to be a falcon!

Almost all of my professors have been enthusiastic and passionate about the content they have been teaching, which creates a more engaging classroom.

Overall, the University provides an ideal situation for those who are not aiming for a large campus or large school. Buildings are no more than 10 minutes away from one another and the chances of bumping into someone you know is very high. Students tend to be interactive when walking to classes and it is just a healthy environment for students who are wanting to get to know others in their major and in the dorms and all over campus.

It is small but a safe campus that makes you feel at home.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2018-05-24T19:41:51.065033Z","guid":"de6d79e5-f0aa-4234-ac56-eaaa0751d1e7","rating":5},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":3}],"photos":{"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-87.67666,37.966188,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-87.67666,37.966188,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.65807962529274,"count":854},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Evansville, IN"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/university-of-southern-indiana/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"da5fca74-e599-4b3f-a403-2c8d7d6b6866","content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"Elmira College","type":"College","url":"elmira-college"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.8216},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":26024},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"940-1180"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Freshman","body":"Elmira’s campus is a very welcoming and safe place. It is really comforting to have campus security there 24/7. Every body from students to faculty are very helpful and friendly and will go out of their own way to help you out. Elmira College has a very home-like feeling to it, everyone feels like family there. It is also very nice to have everything so close on campus... not big at all, so if that is a big factor for you Elmira College is definitely a great choice!","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2018-03-15T20:50:32.509998Z","guid":"9d376b09-8d76-429e-bb60-62410b9bdf4b","rating":5},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":2.33}],"photos":{"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-76.811333,42.092724,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-76.811333,42.092724,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.341113105924596,"count":557},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Elmira, NY"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/elmira-college/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"cae448eb-a4c6-4e01-afd9-c2e8e8afb88b","content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":true,"isPremium":false,"name":"University of Minnesota Duluth","type":"College","url":"university-of-minnesota-duluth"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.7655},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":15664},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"970-1210"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Freshman","body":"At the University of Minnesota - Duluth, everyone is very welcoming! Overall, I was very nervous to move from my small town, but once I got settled in, I was very happy with the decision I made. I have grown so much as a person being independent. The thing that I have found frustrating is that some student advisors are not helpful at all and haven't necessarily steered me in the right direction. I have often found myself having to stress over registering for class, having transfer credits be put into the schools system. Other than that, I have really enjoyed my time in Duluth and have no intentions of transferring.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2018-04-11T04:14:33.452193Z","guid":"f121b6d4-0275-4c75-869a-b5b81daa5019","rating":4},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":3.33}],"photos":{"default":{"crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/1e562a903f6491646584ae64c62ffcdeb6369c36.jpg","MobileHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/a6b0bb6911c55497268733970b537b4a54edb4e2.jpg"},"licenseName":"UNLICENSED"},"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-92.0866,46.817,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-92.0866,46.817,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.5698602794411176,"count":1002},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Duluth, MN"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/university-of-minnesota-duluth/#scatterplot"}}]}
