Its pass no record style of educating freshmen. There is no grading in the first semester. Instead, one gets \"Pass\" or \"Fail\" in his or her transcript. It allows students not to stress too much on grades, but explore the university and majors.\n3. Of course it is the best university in the field of chemical engineering.

Great party life but don't do too much.  Food was great on campus and the campus is constantly growing.  Plenty of diversity and student life is great. Some of the incoming freshman professors were horrible. Which will make academics hard, watch out. But once your in your program of choice it great.  Campus is normally safe.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2017-08-10T05:32:42.524529Z","guid":"b5d1ddf6-f4ce-4d87-94db-7fb7037fdd3a","rating":4},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":2.33}],"photos":{"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-91.190105,30.524558,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-91.190105,30.524558,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.477777777777778,"count":720},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Baton Rouge, LA"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/southern-university--and--a-and-m-college/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"b190dc56-ca74-4245-854d-69a2227cae75","content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"Northeastern Illinois University","type":"College","url":"northeastern-illinois-university"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.7101},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":15432},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"820-930"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Freshman","body":"To tell you the truth, I thought this university would be a bad choice, and I was totally wrong!

It is very easy to find your way around campus because it is fairly small. There are also a ton of maps around to help you on your way. If there are no maps around, asking someone would do the trick! The professors are willing to help you with any issues or concerns. They have an excellent tutoring program at USM that is free as well! There are so many different ways to succeed here!","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2018-04-25T21:29:35.308147Z","guid":"1719a8cf-d0c6-4b11-ab5b-826169e609f6","rating":4},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":2.33}],"photos":{"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-70.276002,43.662637,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-70.276002,43.662637,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.396604938271605,"count":648},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Portland, ME"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/university-of-southern-maine/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"55573aef-c057-4f9b-b5e3-c22129f4e8de","content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"Long Island University - Brooklyn","type":"College","url":"long-island-university---brooklyn"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.875},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":25952},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"800-1040"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Sophomore","body":"At LIU BK I like the location! The school is located in downtown and everything is close by! This school is mostly known for the medical and business field. Every other major is basically pointless. The school is expensive but it matters on how you use you opportunities and resources wisely. Overall the dorms are pretty big than SUNY colleges and their are no parties on campus unless your on the sports team or in some way affiliated with them.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2018-06-07T03:17:05.102286Z","guid":"d31d13b6-51a8-4895-b647-82b834a8eedc","rating":4},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":2.33}],"photos":{"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-73.980872,40.690134,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-73.980872,40.690134,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.461618257261411,"count":964},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Brooklyn, NY"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/long-island-university---brooklyn/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"56908ba2-0e9c-45df-a290-43d3a858a3d6","content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"Lewis University","type":"College","url":"lewis-university"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.5919},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":20232},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"980-1210"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Alum","body":"Lewis has come a long way since my wife and I attended in the 1980's, however it has evolved into a premier regional college.
