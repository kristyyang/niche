The best thing about Wells are the professors. They are invested in you and see you as an individual and not as a number. If you're not doing particularly well, they can set up time for you to review the material because they want you to succeed. Most professors also send out internship opportunities so students can immerse themselves in that particular field.  Clubs like Querencia and Umoja, try to make the school as inclusive as possible by engaging students in hot topics like racism and segregation. They also strive on being active figures in the community, frequently hosting blood drives and potlucks. As an NCAA division 3 school, athletics are what you expect it to be, however, students on campus take their job as athletes seriously. Everyone tries to support each team by showing up to games especially for sports like Volleyball and Basketball.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2017-11-01T18:36:27.356579Z","guid":"fc2bcfcb-d9d1-415c-a33a-e597968bb57b","rating":5},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":2.66}],"photos":{"default":{"crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/735eb3e8a94a96772ab8c570f0f7ab331f9a0377.jpg","MobileHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/6cc203a682a3b221dd174d5e333f710e4f073cdd.jpg"},"licenseName":"UNLICENSED"},"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-76.696512,42.744314,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-76.696512,42.744314,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.1945392491467577,"count":293},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Aurora, NY"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/wells-college/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"c064c235-6c23-4089-a57e-c2d31d9d6621","content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"Norwich University","type":"College","url":"norwich-university"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.6998},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":28242},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"930-1160"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Freshman","body":"Small university where you know almost everybody.

The dorms are old and some outdated but there is construction on campus to update facilities.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2018-04-17T13:20:42.251087Z","guid":"a668d097-dc5f-461e-82fa-c1f9b0807255","rating":4},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":2.66}],"photos":{"default":{"crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/b18305fd0efb3ed01a43a36ad3c31d23e97634a6.jpg","MobileHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/bbd627a06d300c5a261df0b0eca717bcb0765392.jpg"},"licenseName":"UNLICENSED"},"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-92.685,39.1481,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-92.685,39.1481,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.5223880597014925,"count":268},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Fayette, MO"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/central-methodist-university/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"3a9f619c-c041-4aba-a4c6-f789b057ee3f","content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"University of Akron","type":"College","url":"university-of-akron"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.9592},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":16568},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"910-1180"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Niche User","body":"I had great experiences at the University of Akron!

The student life here is dull since most people are commuters and the students only hang around with people from their high school. The food here is from good to average in some days.

The location of Hunter is convenient; it is located in the city so your choices don't fall short when it comes to food. Hunter has a library on nine floors. My complaint is that when you attend Hunter no one tells you anything unless you ask many, many questions! I know several people who took the incorrect class for their major, wasting time and money. Additionally, I feel that in large lecture halls with more than 100 students, there isn't a chance to receive individualized attention.

I found that the professors made themselves available to students who needed extra time outside of classroom time to process materials being taught in class. As a young African American Woman, I was further impressed by not only the diversity of the university's  faculty but also their students. Overall, my experience at CCSU was positive.

Professors at Rowan are also highly skilled, and I have not had a bad one yet!","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2018-05-18T20:18:41.788284Z","guid":"d2273e70-8360-4dea-8208-3daf752f6b7a","rating":4},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":3}],"photos":{"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-75.117974,39.709768,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-75.117974,39.709768,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.404087013843111,"count":1517},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Glassboro, NJ"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/rowan-university/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"6cf54128-3f4c-44a8-b0da-73a675a7e456","content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"South Dakota State University","type":"College","url":"south-dakota-state-university"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.9076},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":21421},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"890-1160"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Junior","body":"South Dakota State University is a place I have been able to grow and succeed in my college career so far. I believe that a diploma from SDSU is as good as any college in the nation. The professors on campus are ready and willing to help, the clubs are fun and involved, and most of all the campus will make you feel right at home. The people that make up SDSU are top notch and in my opinion there is no place better!","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2018-03-12T19:45:59.204145Z","guid":"e8293596-f56e-4faf-9e70-65f8ae2a81f4","rating":5},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":3}],"photos":{"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-96.783415,44.31942,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-96.783415,44.31942,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.4672818791946307,"count":1192},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Brookings, SD"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/south-dakota-state-university/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"d6d22624-e98d-4f03-87d0-b80f3b72c7f8","content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"University of Missouri - Kansas City","type":"College","url":"university-of-missouri---kansas-city"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.6187},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":15368},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"980-1300"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Alum","body":"I majored in Health Sciences. I enjoyed my courses and the professors but my degree is too broad. I recommend specializing from the get-go; major in something specific like Nursing (UMKC has a fantastic nursing program) or Law, Medicine, Dental, etc. However, UMKC is a great school and is very diverse. It's affordable compared to most four year universities. I would definitely reapply for Nursing or a master's degree program in the future!","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2018-04-21T19:03:10.888588Z","guid":"a2ce6d29-d36a-4c92-933e-a47946083d31","rating":4},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":3.33}],"photos":{"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-94.578039,39.035366,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-94.578039,39.035366,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.5599022004889975,"count":1227},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Kansas City, MO"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/university-of-missouri---kansas-city/#scatterplot"}}]}
