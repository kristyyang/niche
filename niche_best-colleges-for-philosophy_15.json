The classes are wonderful and the professors are always helpful and caring. I feel challenged but not completely overwhelmed, even while competing as a student-athlete. The food here is good enough for dorm food. As long as you don't expect gourmet meals, you should be fine. Smith tries very hard to cater to vegan/vegetarians/allergies, but they could do more, especially for gluten allergies. Because I am so busy, I am not much of a partier, so it's a positive for me that Smith is not a party school. From what I have heard, the parties are very tame here, which is not for everyone! \nNorthampton is a cute little town that has just enough to keep me from being bored. The only downside is that the stores and restaurants are all quite expensive.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2017-10-25T13:28:31.461474Z","guid":"cb938965-a581-4e64-ad7f-be85365cb890","rating":5},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":4.33}],"photos":{"default":{"author":"redjar","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/c44d3254a840702e801402bd636d49e55441d51d.jpg","MobileHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/73ccf5c0dfdddaa61d9a8f1d81fdd4596457c0b3.jpg","Thumbnail":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/2d22a0ed441c82d8648f042e0ab772eedaccec5a"},"licenseName":"CC BY-SA","licenseUrl":"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/","sourceUrl":"https://www.flickr.com/photos/redjar/112893078/"},"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-72.638094,42.317933,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-72.638094,42.317933,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.6840236686390533,"count":845},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Northampton, MA"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/smith-college/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"7283a37d-8440-4c00-b86c-78c5038a0791","content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"University of Puget Sound","type":"College","url":"university-of-puget-sound"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.789},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":40416},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"1110-1330"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Sophomore","body":"I think the university is very inclusive and provides lots of opportunities to its students.

Overall I think the university is great for on campus activities, the knowledgable professors and the small classroom sizes.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2018-05-19T18:57:31.166016Z","guid":"ce0e148d-3991-4838-96a5-c765e70a87c3","rating":4},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":2.66}],"photos":{"default":{"crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/3d4e203434169bc3a3125077b2be973409504bc0.jpg","MobileHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/badf7c1f0fb7e98ffbc11258dc12d2d67564face.jpg"},"licenseName":"UNLICENSED"},"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-155.081329,19.701854,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-155.081329,19.701854,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.2812121212121212,"count":825},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Hilo, HI"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/university-of-hawaii-at-hilo/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"8d5e952b-9d81-43bb-807a-ac7d8f81f908","content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"Vassar College","type":"College","url":"vassar-college"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.2688},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":21933},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"1330-1500"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Alum","body":"I loved being a student at Vassar!

Overall, an excellent place to spend your university years!","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2018-02-28T02:14:09.346237Z","guid":"21c0c060-085c-477b-a30d-b9eeebbb28e7","rating":5},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":3.66}],"photos":{"default":{"crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/20d9f6f50994f4b151cfdf692beed51a6400fa69.jpg","MobileHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/9d62971403ece6ef3e36fabb97d7e71e898822da.jpg"},"licenseName":"UNLICENSED"},"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-93.971928,44.324968,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-93.971928,44.324968,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.7096354166666665,"count":768},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Saint Peter, MN"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/gustavus-adolphus-college/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"4f186de4-b8ba-4895-981e-cce08c5a0c50","content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"Mount Holyoke College","type":"College","url":"mount-holyoke-college"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.5219},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":27234},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"1220-1490"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Sophomore","body":"Mount Holyoke College is a lovely, accepting institution. It creates a beautiful community of bright students who engage in rigorous academic discourse in and out of the classroom. Though at times the administration is a bit self-serving and secretive, all the positives outweigh this part. My only suggestion is that they make good on their promise of being a liberal and progressive institution by becoming a sanctuary campus and divesting from fossil fuels. But otherwise it is a great place for a student wanting an academic challenge and looking for a loving community that will be supportive and understanding no matter your background.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2017-12-13T02:03:07.259558Z","guid":"911aa725-a425-4b15-8183-f639661512af","rating":5},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":4.33}],"photos":{"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-72.573625,42.257588,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-72.573625,42.257588,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.7236679058240396,"count":807},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"South Hadley, MA"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/mount-holyoke-college/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"027a04ef-5392-4ca6-a0f6-10634da9a0d2","content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"Trinity College - Connecticut","type":"College","url":"trinity-college---connecticut"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.3395},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":23414},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"1150-1350"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Senior","body":"I have only experienced positive feedback and professors that truly care about how their students are doing in class. I have never known a college where the professors go out of their way to make time to meet with and discuss questions and problems their students have concerning a class project or exam results. If their office hours are not convenient for a students' schedule then the professor will work it out with the student. And there is always email.
