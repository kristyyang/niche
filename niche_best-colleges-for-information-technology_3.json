The campus police are very diligent and make sure all of the students are safe, and there's even an app for safety on campus!

Everyone has great school spirit and safety is tremendous since they have an almost 24 hour limo service that will ensure that you make it back to your dorm after a cheer-filled game or long night of studying in their wonderful library.

All the staff were very nice and helpful whenever I had any issues, which wasn't often in the first place because everyone was so helpful. Lots of my teachers seemed genuinely invested in how I was doing in their class and at GCSU in general.\nThe only thing I ever had an issue with was the mathematics department. Most teachers in that area did seem to care, but oftentimes I found they weren't able to teach the material quite as well as teachers in other areas. It would either be extremely difficult, with teachers going completely over my head, or very, very easy, with the teacher practically going back to basic high school math. It'd be nice to see some more focus on that area and to see it improve some.\nBut overall, this college has a very welcoming and warm environment and I'd recommend it to anyone looking for a good start to college.

There's tremendously unique experiences that NMSU provides for students. Aside from experiences there's also different kind of activities and organizations where I can find a perfect match to what I like to do and people just get to collaborate with one another. There's over 180+ degrees in NMSU to pick from and just the fact that they had the perfect match to the degree that I wanted to pursue.

Our sports/recreational teams and facilities are top tear or currently being renovated to get there. Kent State is always improving and trying to be the best. Cons, being that it is such a huge university parking can be a hassle and the walking can be tiresome. There is a wide range of people there so of course a few aren't going to be the most pleasant. All in all I truly enjoy Kent State and cannot wait to further my education here!","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2018-06-01T17:49:42.813234Z","guid":"39f3ef2a-d3d1-494b-aa89-597fc41c0276","rating":5},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":3}],"photos":{"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-81.342253,41.146856,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-81.342253,41.146856,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.588814210273644,"count":4166},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Kent, OH"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/kent-state-university/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"c3ef387e-6ef8-4c2c-986c-c43188e72c38","content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":true,"isPremium":false,"name":"King University - Tennessee","type":"College","url":"king-university---tennessee"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.5141},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":18918},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"835-1100"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Senior","body":"The communication program at king University in Knoxville Tennessee is one of the best if not the best communication programs to be ever found in continental America. King University founded in 1867 is an accredited university with over 150 years of experience in providing higher education to people from all walks of life and continents.\nThe communication program at King is also very family and adult friendly. As a busy real estate business man before enrolling in the communication program at king University, I felt like my dream of acquiring higher education was impossible due to my schedule and family demands but with King it has been possible with flexible hours and very helpful and experienced instructors.\n If you are ever look for a quality education at an affordable and accredited university, look no further, King university is the place to be!","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2017-10-27T21:42:27.065661Z","guid":"0c087873-156f-4a76-8cc3-4e8e257e68da","rating":5},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":3}],"photos":{"default":{"crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/c5fbe1e73f0218d0f8578a3c38bca587b4cebf8a.jpg","MobileHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/e6be1025327ff3b79daa7b010a4b5f7a55f42915.jpg"},"licenseName":"UNLICENSED"},"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-82.156532,36.585899,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-82.156532,36.585899,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.609467455621302,"count":338},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Bristol, TN"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/king-university---tennessee/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"7663c0db-0ec2-4800-ab9d-81c6af2a3a21","content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"Keystone College","type":"College","url":"keystone-college"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.9763},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":19857},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"780-970"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Sophomore","body":"I love the campus with everything they have to offer. They have a band program, athletics, and several clubs to be involved in. It's like having a second family because there are always people there to help you. On the other hand some classes have timed tests and teachers expect students to get an A+ in 10 minutes with 17 questions. I feel like they don't understand that it's a lot of information to cover. In a regular classroom there aren't timed tests, you have the whole class period to take it. Giving timed tests doesn't let students think for themselves because they have to rush to get every single question. That minimalizes their capability to do well on a test!","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2017-02-19T22:28:56.089689Z","guid":"b34c1a6d-578a-4432-b9c3-f2b6896e02ea","rating":4},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":2}],"photos":{"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-75.777456,41.558969,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-75.777456,41.558969,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.49438202247191,"count":267},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"La Plume, PA"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/keystone-college/#scatterplot"}}]}
