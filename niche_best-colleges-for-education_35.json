Professors are very thorough with lectures, learning material, and what is expected. Study groups are a plus! With the awesome interaction between peers and countless ways of communication, study groups are highly encouraged at ASU, and proven effective! Also, there are many tutoring sessions. There is no reason students should fail. Parties are awesome and anything to imagine! Campus life is amazing; however, some greek organizations are not on the yard.

I appreciate Luther's diversity, with a large international student population, but I often find myself wishing there was more diversity in experience and opinion in my classes. \nWorking with the housing system at Luther was not always the easiest or best experience when trying to manage toxic rooming situations, and think the housing application should be updated, and procedures changed to give students more flexibility.\nOverall, I have had a good experience at Luther, and hope that it will only improve in the years to come.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2018-03-24T19:47:15.968459Z","guid":"0d909646-455d-4fc2-bf14-56e9e4723de3","rating":4},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":4}],"photos":{"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-91.803971,43.313584,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-91.803971,43.313584,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.6958456973293767,"count":674},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Decorah, IA"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/luther-college/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"886d4ec6-99ce-4313-8502-798e1118a149","content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":true,"isPremium":false,"name":"Marymount University","type":"College","url":"marymount-university"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.9055},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":24719},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"860-1080"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Sophomore","body":"My experience at Marymount University has been great so far.

My only complaint is the cost; with tuition fees at $31, 720/yr (not including Room & Board), one can definitely expect to get their money's worth!","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2016-09-12T19:56:17.127994Z","guid":"74531fe1-751b-4f24-a0de-767379ad98e1","rating":4},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":3}],"photos":{"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-87.821872,41.902834,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-87.821872,41.902834,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.5476575121163165,"count":619},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"River Forest, IL"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/dominican-university/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"3f492c07-a790-434c-b628-46a735bcc8e1","content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"Indiana University - Kokomo","type":"College","url":"indiana-university---kokomo"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.6913},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":8718},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"830-1030"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Freshman","body":"Overall, my experience at Indiana University Kokomo has been a learning experience. I feel welcomed on campus, but not included. It is admirable to see how the instructors and professors reach out to students to let them know they are available to help. Nonetheless, when walking from building to building and up and down the halls of the many buildings on campus I am once again reminded I'm here for an education. The environment makes one feel like it is not for socializing, perhaps small talk, but foremost to succeed in everything. I've considered transferring to another four year institution, but then I'm reminded if I want the best environment to study it would IUK. Where else could I find a campus where I feel safe whether I come really early,  have the opportunity to talk one on one with my professor and grow a relationship to have great recommendations, and many opportunities due to the number of \nstudents on campus.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2017-12-28T23:48:21.73246Z","guid":"d3471b18-e997-4eb7-8d6a-b49197034d7f","rating":4},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":2.66}],"photos":{"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-86.132096,40.459913,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-86.132096,40.459913,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.6496350364963503,"count":411},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Kokomo, IN"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/indiana-university---kokomo/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"aab81765-0dc0-4f7e-ac15-280590baed68","content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"Colorado College","type":"College","url":"colorado-college"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.1599},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":23812},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"1220-1430"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Junior","body":"I absolutely love everything the Colorado College (CC) has to offer!

Many students are commuters and transfer students because GSU only started accepting freshmen a few years ago.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2018-01-10T23:17:58.674054Z","guid":"5f9a786a-5023-4364-a2d7-07bfa40d8832","rating":4},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade"}],"photos":{"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-87.717012,41.448603,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-87.717012,41.448603,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.3585526315789473,"count":304},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"University Park, IL"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/governors-state-university/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"0506d9ac-8226-46cd-b7c4-0f3cd8a97e66","content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"Coppin State University","type":"College","url":"coppin-state-university"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.3961},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":8786},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"760-910"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Freshman","body":"I am truly blessed and grateful to be apart of such an extraordinary HBCU. My experience  here has been nothing short of amazing. The students and staff here do everything in their power so that as a whole , the entire university can be successful. I have grew a bond with several staff and students here at Coppin State University that I would have never expected. The teachers are wonderful and humble, and the classes aren't packed where as though it makes it difficult to get the best learning experience there is for yourself. In my opinion Coppin State University is the best HBCU hands down! We know our history, are true to our legacy, and we are moving nowhere but forward. So in closing, my experience here at Coppin State University has filled me with unexplainable joy and undefining hope for the future.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2017-01-23T18:37:38.188683Z","guid":"3ab82fe8-9196-4572-8090-eddc637dd0f1","rating":5},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":1.66}],"photos":{"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-76.658547,39.310786,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-76.658547,39.310786,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.2768959435626104,"count":567},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Baltimore, MD"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/coppin-state-university/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"d8e776e3-b586-4ca3-9b96-3be5437a570d","content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":true,"isPremium":true,"name":"Colby College","type":"College","url":"colby-college"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.1871},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":21032},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"1270-1470"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Alum","body":"When I reflect on my time at Colby, I am grateful for the small liberal arts experience; the feeling of community, small class sizes with professors who knew your name, and free printing. I am now pursuing post-graduate studies at a big University and the resources available to students, professor expertise, and quality of coursework is inferior to Colby in almost every way. Colby students are friendly, extremely intelligent, and well-rounded. Most of my friends volunteered, had an on-campus job or worked in a lab, and actively participated in campus clubs. The Colby bubble can become a little suffocating, as it is easy to not leave campus for weeks, but I am honestly sad I will never be in such a tight-knit community of similar-minded peers again. Colby is not perfect by all means, but it's a damn good school. If you choose to go to Colby, go in with an open mind, positive attitude, and readiness to introduce yourself to a million people.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2017-12-29T03:27:58.977015Z","guid":"bfdf69be-e5e9-4bb4-9ef6-0d01bd59e2e7","rating":4},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":4.33}],"photos":{"default":{"crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/dfdaf6431156601d8dae33ecab8f2ffe44140ae0.jpg","MobileHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/033e87f66b4397f2d715ed17e562a91b10c0024d.jpg","Thumbnail":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/1b8ae1cb324d4beb19924b807180732918207245"},"licenseName":"UNLICENSED"},"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-69.66337,44.564211,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-69.66337,44.564211,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.72635814889336,"count":497},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Waterville, ME"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/colby-college/#scatterplot"}}]}
