It is not a typical college campus with brick buildings and grassy fields. It's nestled in the city of Richmond where you have a diverse and dynamic mix of students, city dwellers, artists, and everything you can imagine! I would never trade this for another \"typical\" school. In terms of academics, everything is accessible through student tutoring sessions, group review sessions (highly advisable). It's challenging (especially if you do the Honors College), but worth your while. THe study abroad programs are EXCELLENT. I did 2 of them myself, and definitely recommend it-- they find a way to finance whatever study abroad you want to do, through their scholarship office. \nI only take 1 star away because I was a commuter and did not enjoy VCU as much as the residential students. However, the commute is also highly doable and there is a lot of parking available to students.

Coming to UNM has been an amazing experience because not only have I've met sensational friends but also I've been able to grow as a student. This university has been able to provide helpful resources like CAPS tutoring and awesome organizations to get involved in. I'm currently in the ASUNM Community Experience group, where we've been able to  connect with a diverse amount of people by volunteering and helping out within the university and Albuquerque. Living on campus has also been an incredible experience because of our close net community. Every week there is something to do on campus, especially in the dormitories, like: cuddling a canine, carnivals, free movies and most importantly free food/snacks! Being a part of UNM has given me unforgettable memories, close friends and fun experiences.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2018-04-17T01:21:56.060697Z","guid":"451c1596-1fe1-4cbb-9206-0efc9e28370c","rating":5},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":3}],"photos":{"default":{"crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/24131ce06dea388526bedc6ad307882eb9da3219.jpg","MobileHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/062851d99af8e29d786a585ae1faa1c045b34c54.jpg"},"licenseName":"UNLICENSED"},"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-106.620155,35.083868,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-106.620155,35.083868,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.474596896866444,"count":3287},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Albuquerque, NM"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/university-of-new-mexico/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"bdfbfaf3-f957-4b03-8c05-b600a3938e27","content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"Portland State University","type":"College","url":"portland-state-university"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.8942},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":14481},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"930-1160"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Freshman","body":"Portland State is a inviting environment in which one of the university's main goal is to have everyone feel accepted.  I love the diverse group of people on campus and how safe I feel with everyone.  The new students I have met now feel like family to me, ones I never would have crossed paths with if I have not attended Portland State University.  Also, the dorms are clean and feel homey just as if you were at home! This is one of the other reasons I love Portland State.  Besides the students and dorms, the campus is located in downtown Portland which is amazing since you are able to see new art, people, and shop around.  Overall, Portland State is an amazing university to attend and they only give students the best possible opportunities.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2018-04-29T02:15:58.131033Z","guid":"4642a70f-8eb8-4d39-868f-1ba7ff3c68cd","rating":5},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":3}],"photos":{"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-122.683553,45.511229,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-122.683553,45.511229,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.568950177935943,"count":2248},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Portland, OR"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/portland-state-university/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"e10a097f-d982-484e-b167-7032f5e24440","content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"Brigham Young University - Idaho","type":"College","url":"brigham-young-university---idaho"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.9583},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":8344},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"900-1110"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Sophomore","body":"Brigham Young University- Idaho is located in the little town of Rexburg, surrounded by rolling hills and farm fields.

Unlike other schools, Old Dominion allows their freshman to enjoy their college experience. We have only 1-2 visitation rules, residents don't have a curfew, and dorms are co-ed. With all this freedom, the university still makes sure our work gets done. We are given free tutoring, study rooms on every floor of every dorm, and many educational centers. To relax from the stress of school, you could party near or on campus! Safe Ride (ODU's free transportation.) will take you anywhere that isn't beyond 38th street, which most parties aren't.

The amount of resources offered here at TXST are helpful, there is always help around every corner! My favorite part about being a bobcat is the energy associated walking through TXST’s campus, someone is always giving out free food (always accept free food in college), people play music, programs are out in the Quad doing activities at times and the overall feeling from being a student here at Texas State is powerful.

Becoming a bobcat at Texas State University was the best decision I’ve ever made, and I am grateful for my high level of education.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2018-02-01T02:28:09.441055Z","guid":"095031b9-5176-4791-a118-c0282146277c","rating":5},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":3.33}],"photos":{"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-97.936392,29.889202,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-97.936392,29.889202,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.7317608337904553,"count":5469},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"San Marcos, TX"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/texas-state-university/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"b7c5c6c9-6a6f-4a1f-b098-c71ddd41de83","content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"University of Georgia","type":"College","url":"university-of-georgia"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.539},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":14956},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"1140-1340"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Sophomore","body":"This is university is perfect for students hoping to have fun while at college.

There are so many opportunities presented to students at USC that all should take advantage of. One of the most important things that is clearly valued here, is academics. My professors so far have been some of the most passionate people I have met. A favorite course I have taken here has been environmental ethics. I took this course as a philosophy requirement and it inspired me to change my major to environmental studies. The professor and the course material inspired me to make a decision that I will not soon regret. I am more than happy to say that I am a student at USC.

One thing I do wish was different would be the amount of students that are accepted. With so many students here, it's very difficult to get into the classes necessary to graduate. There are a lot of impacted majors, but that is because the programs Sac State offers have to be some of the best in the country; so, it's understandable.

The campus is beautiful and everyone is so welcoming.  I felt at home the first time I visited and automatically I knew UK was the school I wanted to attend.  There's a whole week of activities in August before classes start specifically for incoming freshman to get them acclimated to the university and show them everything UK has to offer.  There are numerous tutoring services and most professors are flexible with their office hours to find a time that works for the student.  Almost everyday there's a different activity happening on campus, from goat yoga and Pinterest parties for stress relief, to live music and food to spend time with friends, to tailgates before sports games to support our Wildcats with the most spirit.  It's clear that the university strives to create the best environment for students' success and well-being.

The diversity of classes has allowed me to not only get a biology degree, but I will also have three minors , including Japanese. The other two minor degrees I will receive in the spring of 2018 will be pshycology and statistics. Campus life has been just steps away from my apartment at Harless center, making it easy to attend different function happening on campus downtown. I have gained a great value on being independent through living off campus in my own apartment. I have also meet some very interesting people from different cultures and countries.
