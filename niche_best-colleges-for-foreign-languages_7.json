We have a great science department and our Chemistry is one of the best among the liberal arts college. There are lots of opportunity for research too.

It is a great school academically and provides all of the opportunities a student could want in terms of good professors, real life experience and a supportive culture. Looking at the social aspect of the school, Butler has a very-tight knit group of student that share similar values (\"The Butler Way\"). Also, it is great to be so close to Broad Ripple and Downtown as this is obviously a big advantage both professionally and socially. Diversity on campus is not great, but I do think it is getting better. All in all, I would 100% recommend Butler if you are still deciding.

Thanks to the friendly teachers, staff and peers, I find myself much more confident and sociable. The campus scene is beautiful all year round. I am the only Vietnamese kid on campus, so sometimes I can feel small and lonely, but no, in Cornell College, I have sources to reach whenever I need. If you are bored after a long day of classes, the best thing to do is to sit on the grass and relax. Cornell College campus scene is beautiful all year round, spring, summer, fall, winter, I never get sick of it. \nThe food is diverse, much much better than it used to be around 4-5 years ago. Now everyone can enjoy new variety of food everyday, including Asian, Latin, European food. \nMy friends on campus are friendly with LGBT, black and international, so the atmosphere makes everybody feel comfortable.

As a psychology major it is hard to get into classes you need as they close out, even if you came in with a ton of AP credits. Also, so many classes are big so its harder to focus and do well in them. The campus is hilly. Academics are great, i’ve only had one bad teacher. Advising sucks I had to figure everything out on my own. Mountainview dorms were awfull, invisible RA, no community events, unfriendly people etc. Now I live in Newing and I love it and it’s so much better! Many Long Island students, intentational students (mostly from Asia) and Jewish students. You have to find your people at this school but once you do your experience can be great. Also, we don’t have certain majors like education (also communications, and others people complain about) which really sucks but they try to sell you on their grad program. The food is hit or miss, definitely go to the Kosher station since they have the best food.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2018-05-23T01:30:53.174035Z","guid":"98f168b2-72e9-48d0-bb5e-1cc0fdef30f8","rating":4},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":3.66}],"photos":{"default":{"crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/843cc93be5f59a4bf97adb882d92fccaf932660b.jpg","MobileHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/e1bba7684cb59ca91b80ae5381f80c29566dec0c.jpg"},"licenseName":"UNLICENSED"},"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-75.971143,42.088049,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-75.971143,42.088049,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.5464154411764706,"count":2176},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Vestal, NY"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/binghamton-university-suny/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"3e3b4110-0c43-4d56-b5f9-6c060dc07841","badge":{"display":"Best Colleges in America","ordinal":300,"total":1644,"vanityURL":"best-colleges"},"content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"University of North Florida","type":"College","url":"university-of-north-florida"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.6453},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":13484},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"1040-1220"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Alum","body":"I am now a graduate of UNF with a B.S. in Biology.

I’ve many that talk openly and respectfully concerning lgbt issues, diversity issues, and they always end with their discussions inspiration and motivation to dream big and achieve our goals. \n\nIt’d be a dream if I could continue my education there.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2018-06-04T17:43:01.882008Z","guid":"1ffe6e36-cd4f-4fff-b11b-544c393955d0","rating":5},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":4}],"photos":{"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-111.846044,40.762484,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-111.846044,40.762484,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.7160945413618456,"count":3554},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Salt Lake City, UT"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/university-of-utah/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"f4330e7e-4f74-45ce-b6cf-82c9ee3da7a6","badge":{"display":"Best Colleges in America","ordinal":709,"total":1644,"vanityURL":"best-colleges"},"content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"University of New Hampshire at Manchester","type":"College","url":"university-of-new-hampshire-at-manchester"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.6983},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":15489},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"980-1220"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Freshman","body":"The University of New Hampshire at Manchester is a place unlike an other to go to receive an education.

This made it very difficult for me to actively participate in most of the events at school, which there were quite a few last fall that I would have loved to be a part of. They other thing that needs work is the parking situation on campus. There are not a lot of spots to park, most are tiny, and when you do get a spot, you may have to walk to the completely other side of the campus just to get to class! Other than those two things, my experience with St. Catherine University has been great thus far.

The professors in it are amazing. I definitely made the right choice by coming to Mcdaniel, but it isn't for everyone. The people here are generally very nice and helpful, and have a lot of hobbies. No one does just one thing. Despite the fact that the town of Westminster isn't that great, the school community will keep you busy. If you utilize your resources here, you will be very happy with all opportunities that come your way! The food was AWFUL the first semester this year, but after many many student complaints, they are now improving the overall food quality, so that's good. You definitely feel a sense of community at Mcdaniel, which is something I was really looking for in a school and have found here. It is really easy for you to find people you chick with! There is so much to be involved with. You will find organizations that match your views and hobbies, and classes that fit what you're looking for.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2018-04-20T01:02:55.34154Z","guid":"ec1e87f9-464c-4db5-92c3-5307b2c387d7","rating":4},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":3.33}],"photos":{"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-77.001662,39.584879,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-77.001662,39.584879,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.4177852348993287,"count":596},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Westminster, MD"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/mcdaniel-college/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"63e76011-4469-456a-ad84-ab370526df66","badge":{"display":"Best Colleges in America","ordinal":498,"total":1644,"vanityURL":"best-colleges"},"content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"Lake Forest College","type":"College","url":"lake-forest-college"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.5694},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":24478},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"1020-1240"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Junior","body":"I made a wonderful choice to attend Lake Forest College. It first drew my attention for being close to home, and I later found out about all the other great features it has. The small student body size allows for more one-on-one time with faculty. This allows for students to get more personalized feedback and assistance with academics. Also, Lake Forest does an excellent job of fostering student leaders through a variety of clubs and programs on and off campus. I feel as if there are plenty of opportunities for my voice to be heard and to make a difference at this school. Additionally, all the professors I have had the pleasure of taking classes with have been amazing. They are all extremely knowledgeable people who want their students to succeed.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2018-04-17T04:32:39.326071Z","guid":"6b769569-7a8e-4c18-9141-97f2f5ca761f","rating":5},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":3.33}],"photos":{"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-87.830777,42.250456,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-87.830777,42.250456,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.405727923627685,"count":419},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Lake Forest, IL"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/lake-forest-college/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"c581a415-c253-4439-9568-cd46bc32427f","badge":{"display":"Best Colleges in America","ordinal":169,"total":1644,"vanityURL":"best-colleges"},"content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":true,"isPremium":false,"name":"Virginia Military Institute","type":"College","url":"virginia-military-institute"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.5095},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":16195},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"1060-1240"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"College Sophomore","body":"The professors are very easy to get in contact with and have an actual interest in the success of their students. I have never once felt like I couldn't go to a professor for help with something, and even if I couldn't, there are multiple organizations and areas to receive help in all my classes. VMI has excellent major-related and Gen Ed. classes, especially in the STEM fields. That being said, there aren't many elective classes, and there are virtually no art-type classes (art history, music, etc). Classes are all pretty small, with the largest I've seen being about 24 students. Given the school only has about 1,700 students at any given time, this is understandable. Class styles are all pretty similar, with classrooms generally being of the same design across the board, with obvious variations for labs.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2016-07-20T16:23:52Z","guid":"a1845130-46dd-4084-b242-b5a26fb598af","rating":4},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":4}],"photos":{"default":{"crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/afc842363afa32b406a48ef9d159fdf3842f80f9.jpg","MobileHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/a58cba0c6eed68533ae9635841ad36edeb9a465e.jpg"},"licenseName":"UNLICENSED"},"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-79.435737,37.790644,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-79.435737,37.790644,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.3535911602209945,"count":181},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Lexington, VA"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/virginia-military-institute/#scatterplot"}}]}
