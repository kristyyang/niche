You are able to build a relationship with each of your professors because the class size is about 20 students. Having a real connection with your professor means they get to know you and you get to know them. They will be great references or write great recommendations for whatever you need. In addition to professors, you create long lasting friendships with your peers. Everyone becomes close and you  support each other to get through the semester.

When I had to move back to Houston, my parents suggested attending UHCL because they both got their masters degree from UHCL. I love the campus, it's so beautiful. the staff is great and very helpful. The food they serve is delicious and fresh. The restrooms are always clean! everything is clean! Classes are small and I love it!","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2018-06-08T01:41:00.423816Z","guid":"fb4bcf7c-cb18-45ec-be9c-282803208e07","rating":5},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade"}],"photos":{"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-95.098129,29.582523,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-95.098129,29.582523,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.7914438502673797,"count":561},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Houston, TX"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/university-of-houston---clear-lake/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"bbe24039-1f41-42fd-b401-7e1eedcb3b24","content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":true,"isPremium":false,"name":"College of the Holy Cross","type":"College","url":"college-of-the-holy-cross"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.3846},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":26965},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"1230-1370"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Alum","body":"The College has an exceptional tradition and especially high academic standards.  Its alumni are close and tightly-knit... a great thing for friendship and professional interests.  The campus is among the most beautiful in the country and if Worcester is not Boston, it is lively and within easy travel not only to Boston but to ski country to the West and North.  Though (like Boston College and Georgetown) it has a Catholic history, kids who are not Catholic will find it a hidden treasure and on a par with New England's finest liberal arts colleges.

It’s very easy to find time with professors to help you with a class outside of class. Many professors offer office hours when you can stop by and ask for help on anything. In my 3 years there I’ve never had a problem with getting help from a professor. On top of that the student body is really nice. Almost everyone I run into is really freindly and it’s very easy to make new friends! The one complaint I have is the food, it’s not necessarily the healthiest or best priced.

I had numerous opportunities to explore my passions and excel in my academics. I was employed in several on-campus positions including Residence Life and had wonderful opportunities in the Psychology department. I did find that some restrictions were a bit drastic compared to the way I was raised and there are some aspects of the campus culture that I could have done without; however, my overall experience was made amazing by my participation in the John Wesley Honors College! I would recommend this university to any student looking to pursue excellence and who doesn't mind a slightly conservative environment.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2018-02-19T19:58:45.398024Z","guid":"f170150f-b3f0-46bc-a900-e8e0d9185a1b","rating":4},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":3}],"photos":{"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-85.661991,40.518495,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-85.661991,40.518495,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.879144385026738,"count":935},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Marion, IN"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/indiana-wesleyan-university/#scatterplot"}}]}
