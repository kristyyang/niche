There are many restaurants nearby. Also, there are bars and clubs nearby if you are interested in the night life! I am a freshman. So far, my instructors have taught well! A lot of work is required, but I'm sure that goes for any university. There are students of all ages. The parking is TERRIBLE. The school has purchased all parking anywhere near the school and parking permits are needed everywhere. I tried to buy a parking permit but there were no more available. So I was forced to walk a mile to classes, and even still had to pay at parking meters. I didn't mind the walk, but sometimes could not find parking. Another thing I didn't appreciate is that there are no places where I could pump my breast milk, since I am a breastfeeding momma. I always had to pump in restrooms which seemed unsanitary and quite frankly stinky at times. My adviser has been great! She is very helpful. I really do like the school, these were just a few concerns of mine.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2018-06-06T17:53:20.55995Z","guid":"399fb7dd-8c08-4b3d-bb4a-1792d16e7a08","rating":4},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":3}],"photos":{"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-106.50356,31.771697,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-106.50356,31.771697,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.578669910786699,"count":2466},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"El Paso, TX"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/university-of-texas---el-paso/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"cd028a45-f057-4ba3-b2a5-f46f60d50fe3","content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"Metropolitan State University of Denver","type":"College","url":"metropolitan-state-university-of-denver"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.6387},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":12104},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"880-1100"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Junior","body":"I am currently going to Metro, and my experience as a returning student/single mom has been very rewarding.

My professor was amazing, and so was the music program as a whole. I was able to pursue a double major with an outside field, and while it was difficult and busy, the administration helped me every quarter by allowing me to take extra classes to finish on time. The campus is beautiful, but there is always construction. It is not a huge party school, but there are parties and lots of other ways to have fun. I loved the proximity to Chicago and the public transit system. Overall, I liked the student body. There was a general hard work ethic, and though my majors weren't particularly competitive, I know there were some that were fairly cut-throat. The mental health services can be improved upon, but I felt that NU was a very accepting, diverse, and progressive school overall.

Weather you like hiking, mountain biking, skiing, paddle boarding you name it then CMU is the right choice for you. And even if you've never done any of those thing CMU has a wonderful Outdoors program that will take you on trips and teach you the basics. Outdoors activites not for you that's okay we have a great rec gym with racquetball courts, basketball courts, rock climbing wall and even a Olympic size swimming pool.

I also got accepted into Sigma Kappa, the new sorority on campus. Being in Sigma Kappa was the one of the best things that had ever happened to me. It formed me into a social butterfly and allowed me to really help out in the community. The women of Sigma Kappa came together to host events with other sororities to bring people together for charity. Being at APSU has transformed my life in the most amazing ways. I will always cherish the memories I have and the memories I will continue to make while attending at Austin Peay. Go Govs!","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2018-05-15T23:06:48.651412Z","guid":"25616d7b-1f87-4978-8b4f-917489ccfc62","rating":5},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":2.66}],"photos":{"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-87.354081,36.533319,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-87.354081,36.533319,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.5682747342600165,"count":1223},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Clarksville, TN"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/austin-peay-state-university/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"a0f566ad-11d3-485b-8879-df105d764754","badge":{"display":"Best Colleges in America","ordinal":638,"total":1644,"vanityURL":"best-colleges"},"content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"SUNY Farmingdale State College","type":"College","url":"suny-farmingdale-state-college"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.5802},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":8687},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"880-1060"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Alum","body":"My overall experience with Farmingdale State College was great. There’s a lot of diversity at Farmingdale, such as career choices, culture, and lifestyle . Farmingdale urges you to express exactly who you are. There are many clubs that allow you to really liberate yourself and express how you feel, what you like and that you are supported no matter what. I met a lot of people at very different stages in their lives. Some were like me, who went straight from high school into college. Others were returning to college or starting college for the first time ever who had graduated from high school years ago. Not only did I feel I had great peers, but I had outstanding professors who not only filled me with knowledge but genuinely cared about me and my process. The only thing I would change is  making clubs mandatory. So more students would attend.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2018-05-27T14:30:17.724711Z","guid":"acb8bba3-98ac-42da-9cc4-8ea5fe373aca","rating":4},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":3}],"photos":{"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-73.426371,40.75408,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-73.426371,40.75408,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.708,"count":500},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Farmingdale, NY"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/suny-farmingdale-state-college/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"160f2a67-5da7-4575-8b6b-221755b064eb","badge":{"display":"Best Colleges in America","ordinal":689,"total":1644,"vanityURL":"best-colleges"},"content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"Saginaw Valley State University","type":"College","url":"saginaw-valley-state-university"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.7587},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":14475},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"901-1100"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Alum","body":"Great school, professors, community involvement/ outreach, activities, and scenery. However, the financial aid office was a complete and utter NIGHTMARE! I constantly had issues with the office and had to call and wait on the line for 15 minutes plus. The way things were set up in the office and online was confusing for students and a pain to deal with. Hopefully they figure it out because it is a great school, just wish that office was easier to deal with.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2018-05-29T16:23:42.075037Z","guid":"e799721d-da44-4004-8ee6-0ab2e89d8dd8","rating":4},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":3}],"photos":{"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-83.96434,43.55187,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-83.96434,43.55187,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.6413502109704643,"count":1422},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"University Center, MI"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/saginaw-valley-state-university/#scatterplot"}}]}
