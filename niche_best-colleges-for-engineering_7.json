The overall atmosphere was rather warm, even in the cold months with the absurd levels of snow. Activities were ever abundant, and when it was time to work, there were numerous study groups and 24 hour resources available to students, regardless of major. The majority of my professors were not only exceptionally helpful, but also available and flexible when it came to making time for students. Obviously, no place is perfect, and there were some minor butting of heads between the different schools of study within Alfred, which at times would carry into the students perceptions, but overall everyone managed to get along fairly well, regardless of major, race, gender, orientation and the such. It should be noted that the school has an excellent exchange program for those coming from overseas.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2018-03-02T21:43:12.429078Z","guid":"930ead6b-37f1-44cd-a520-101f1af38c22","rating":5},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":3}],"photos":{"default":{"crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/9a519177b789c4c95c7b5142010454248239883d.jpg","MobileHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/a37ed0ac0e2502a7f87201575c5ceaf30cf9bd4a.jpg"},"licenseName":"UNLICENSED"},"mapbox_header":{"crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-77.788625,42.255866,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-77.788625,42.255866,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"UNLICENSED"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.3238636363636362,"count":528},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Alfred, NY"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/alfred-university/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"62f0c452-9441-4c5b-b83d-cd8de1a7527c","badge":{"display":"Best Colleges for Engineering in America","ordinal":154,"total":370,"vanityURL":"best-colleges-for-engineering"},"content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":true,"isPremium":false,"name":"University of San Diego","type":"College","url":"university-of-san-diego"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.5138},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":38596},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"1100-1310"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Alum","body":"This was a fantastic experience and broadened my perspective with the diverse community that attends. I came here for grad school after going to a top UC school for undergrad, and I feel that the experience here was much more inviting than my undergrad experience.

I think the very diverse student body greatly adds to the experience, and I really enjoyed getting to know so many different people from around the world.

In the beginning I was uncomfortable with my transition and unable to feel at home. Through clubs and sports teams I was able to develop new friendships and life skills that made me feel more at home. There are so many opportunities presented to students at USC that all should take advantage of. One of the most important things that is clearly valued here, is academics. My professors so far have been some of the most passionate people I have met. A favorite course I have taken here has been environmental ethics. I took this course as a philosophy requirement and it inspired me to change my major to environmental studies. The professor and the course material inspired me to make a decision that I will not soon regret. I am more than happy to say that I am a student at USC.

I lived on campus for one year and now I commute from my home in Northern NJ. Since my first major is Education of the Deaf and Hard of Hearing and my second Psychology, I have mainly spent my time in the Education Building and the Social Sciences Building. The professors here are incredibly intelligent and love to get to know the students as more than just a number. This is mainly due to the small class sizes, which I believe is one of the benefits of this institution. The professors are willing to work with you outside of class because they truly value your understanding of the subjects. I am continuously motivated to become a future educator by the professors that I have had and I can't wait to continue on in this career.

I've learned so much and I am actually enjoying it. Many Christian schools tend to sacrifice quality of education for making everything \"christian\", Cedarville does not do this. At Cedarville they take education seriously and teach at a high academic level.\nOver all, Cedarville is an excellent school and a great choice.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2017-12-28T19:25:28.707719Z","guid":"b62ad6e7-5668-4b9e-b726-a8dc8d8ad8d0","rating":4},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":3.33}],"photos":{"mapbox_header":{"author":"Â© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-83.812098,39.750338,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-83.812098,39.750338,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"Â© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.8205882352941174,"count":1020},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Cedarville, OH"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/cedarville-university/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"c581a415-c253-4439-9568-cd46bc32427f","badge":{"display":"Best Colleges for Engineering in America","ordinal":160,"total":370,"vanityURL":"best-colleges-for-engineering"},"content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":true,"isPremium":false,"name":"Virginia Military Institute","type":"College","url":"virginia-military-institute"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.5095},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":16195},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"1060-1240"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"College Sophomore","body":"The professors are very easy to get in contact with and have an actual interest in the success of their students. I have never once felt like I couldn't go to a professor for help with something, and even if I couldn't, there are multiple organizations and areas to receive help in all my classes. VMI has excellent major-related and Gen Ed. classes, especially in the STEM fields. That being said, there aren't many elective classes, and there are virtually no art-type classes (art history, music, etc). Classes are all pretty small, with the largest I've seen being about 24 students. Given the school only has about 1,700 students at any given time, this is understandable. Class styles are all pretty similar, with classrooms generally being of the same design across the board, with obvious variations for labs.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2016-07-20T16:23:52Z","guid":"a1845130-46dd-4084-b242-b5a26fb598af","rating":4},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":4}],"photos":{"default":{"crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/afc842363afa32b406a48ef9d159fdf3842f80f9.jpg","MobileHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/a58cba0c6eed68533ae9635841ad36edeb9a465e.jpg"},"licenseName":"UNLICENSED"},"mapbox_header":{"author":"Â© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-79.435737,37.790644,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-79.435737,37.790644,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"Â© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.3535911602209945,"count":181},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Lexington, VA"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/virginia-military-institute/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"8cd719a3-9f66-4a61-a1eb-f2a312b02acc","badge":{"display":"Best Colleges for Engineering in America","ordinal":161,"total":370,"vanityURL":"best-colleges-for-engineering"},"content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"University of Missouri","type":"College","url":"university-of-missouri"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.747},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":16317},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"1020-1290"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Senior","body":"University of Missouri- Columbia is a school that allows such a variety of studies that almost anyone can find a major they will enjoy pursuing.

A huge disappointment, since a lot of universities do offer such programs.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2017-08-10T03:48:37.714462Z","guid":"88fe80ef-13e4-4c72-80a0-6dacddcad432","rating":4},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":3}],"photos":{"mapbox_header":{"author":"Â© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-117.819019,34.054273,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-117.819019,34.054273,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"Â© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.547645125958379,"count":2739},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Pomona, CA"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/california-state-polytechnic-university---pomona/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"f93307b6-206b-4b2b-b35d-82fb1988c784","content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"University of New Hampshire","type":"College","url":"university-of-new-hampshire"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.7586},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":23066},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"990-1200"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Sophomore","body":"Durham itself is quiet, However busses/trains run nonstop to everywhere. There's acres of college woods too!\nMost on-campus dorms represent a theme so that everyone can feel like they belong. \nThe courses are hard-professors expect you to study out of class, but they have office hours and are willing to stay after class with you.\nCFAR helps you find study plans, discover what kind of learner you are, and figure out how to tackle difficult classes. There's free tutoring if needed\nUNH works with most study abroad programs. It's discovery credit system makes it easy for credits to transfer towards your major. \nFor food It's in the top 1% of USA. There's 3 dining halls as well as shops all around campus. It's unbelievable(trust me on this)\nD1 Aka sports events are crazy. Football/hockey is intense; there's huge tailgate parties\nGreek life and sports teams have their own houses so the parties are good.\nSo many clubs/orgs. It's super easy to stay active and get involved on campus.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2017-09-15T05:02:30.978588Z","guid":"26d4be99-3336-4c13-84de-f9e924cd59ed","rating":5},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":3.66}],"photos":{"mapbox_header":{"author":"Â© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-70.934512,43.134235,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-70.934512,43.134235,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"Â© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.6387771520514884,"count":2486},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Durham, NH"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/university-of-new-hampshire/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"b13ffea8-7ed5-4389-b870-029bb8559596","content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"University of North Dakota","type":"College","url":"university-of-north-dakota"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.8369},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":14693},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"960-1190"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Graduate Student","body":"I am in my last semester of the UND Special Ed online masters program before my internship and then graduation next semester. I have truly enjoyed the courses I have taken as I am learning so much valuable information that I can apply to my career. I enjoyed analyzing the characteristics of students with learning disabilities and the various approaches and methods used to foster ideal learning environments in the classroom. I had the opportunity to learn from professors who exemplify what they teach, and benefited from hands on experience to implement what I have learned. My professors and the entire college are so understanding, thoughtful, and caring. They want to help you succeed and work with you. They even called me in Florida to make sure I was okay and offer extended deadlines after Hurricane Irma. This is also the cheapest, quickest way to get my degree and really learn my stuff so I can be the most educated, experienced, and effective educator I can be.

My roommate and all the peers I have run into are decent people, if not really nice and friendly. Campus is small, which Is a bit of a personal negative, but itâs gorgeous and most of the time I am really thankful itâs so quick to get around. My professors have been friendly, genuinely passionate about their subjects and invested in my progress. The food is AMAZING for campus food - It regularly changes and encompasses different ethnic foods. \nFor the School of Education specifically, I can say the advisors are quirky and fun and up for casual check ins and in prompt to drop ins from their advisees.
