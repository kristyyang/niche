There are tons of possibilities that one can get involved in at Penn State through clubs, community involvement, or sports.  As an engineer, I am very glad that I chose this particular school because our engineering department is one of the best in the United States, and the chances of finding a job upon graduation is quite high.  There is one particular thing that I would like to see change in the future at Penn State and that particular change is with academic scholarships for students.  Currently, Penn State only offers athletic scholarships at the main campus, and at branch campuses I was able to find out that they offer academic scholarships.  There are particular scholarships offered through individual colleges at main, but for someone is graduates in the top percentage of their class there should be some sort of scholarship given.  Overall, Penn State is a great school.

I began to wonder from my previous year of college whether or not college was for me. However, within hours of starting Clemson I began to realize that college here was going to be great.  My professors have embedded within me a love to read, and I have read more books that were not required by my classes, within my two years here, than I had in all of middle school and high school. Even though I did not focus on the social life at Clemson when I first started, I quickly was able to find friends from all backgrounds, some being from various clubs and fraternities, to those on the football team. College game day at Clemson is quite possibly the most exciting sports venue in the United States! Clemson has given me the ability to grow as a person, both academically and socially, and I see myself as being a better man since coming Clemson than I was two years ago before I enrolled here!","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2018-02-26T18:52:02.04411Z","guid":"f168dc56-bd14-406c-afbe-96b454babeda","rating":5},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":4}],"photos":{"default":{"author":"greerjasona","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/866366c511a89c41a22800e481653247a15041da.jpg","MobileHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/92bd9e552f70188d14b8b397043e904e07d8e9d9.jpg","Thumbnail":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/9f3d6145f05e7ee87c4a483379ab7ff1daeb0e44"},"licenseName":"CC BY ","licenseUrl":"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/2.0/","sourceUrl":"https://www.flickr.com/photos/greerjasona/16202933089/"},"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-82.834463,34.677329,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-82.834463,34.677329,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.8071186440677964,"count":2950},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Clemson, SC"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/clemson-university/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"d4afc202-a90c-4cb9-9c9f-f7d0e9db2743","badge":{"display":"Best Colleges for Engineering in America","ordinal":54,"total":370,"vanityURL":"best-colleges-for-engineering"},"content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"Auburn University","type":"College","url":"auburn-university"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.8054},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":21698},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"1060-1260"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Junior","body":"I adore the sense of family here!

However, the diversity presented within the school is quite low. There are sparse percentages of Latinos, Hispanics, African Americans, and Asians.

Additonally, many of the teachers and remainder of the faculty are friendly and supportive for all students to succeed.

The university is very diverse and accommodates for everyone. One of the best security feature they have are these emergency call booths where someone can press the emergency button and the campus police will be there under 90 seconds.

The architecture is beautiful and the location is as well. I would have been attending the School of Social Work which is a separate campus and is right next to a beautiful body of water. Since I do not attend BU in person, I would love to say that my online professors have been more than helpful; they have personally inspired me as well as motivated me. My professors go above and beyond for me, this is why I will always choose Boston University and recommend this school to everyone!","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2018-04-13T07:03:12.075125Z","guid":"3f86a6d1-e452-4a70-ab95-a96253ba8e6a","rating":5},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":4.33}],"photos":{"default":{"crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/ca8080dbc672a9072f59b64bd530fecfb5594c27.jpg","MobileHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/23cf3c4b3c7d7cc4456e139fb74b2390c0baebb0.jpg","Thumbnail":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/1ebb7d55f55332313273fd8fb0969cde58a14564"},"licenseName":"UNLICENSED"},"mapbox_header":{"crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-71.09984,42.349581,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-71.09984,42.349581,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"UNLICENSED"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.605548469387755,"count":3136},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Boston, MA"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/boston-university/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"9ec8d52e-4aec-4d22-8932-cd330813dcd5","badge":{"display":"Best Colleges for Engineering in America","ordinal":64,"total":370,"vanityURL":"best-colleges-for-engineering"},"content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":true,"isPremium":false,"name":"Washington & Lee University","type":"College","url":"washington--and--lee-university"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.2358},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":23867},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"1320-1460"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Alum","body":"Washington and Lee offers a wonderful liberal arts education at a premier southern institution.

Despite all of its flaws and imperfections, it is a safe space where I can explore and learn. The campus itself is a small city with features that make it feel more cozy than full-out sophisticated. From our beautiful Cathedral of Learning (we lovingly call her Cathy) to the spacious Schenley Park, there are tons of secret nooks that are perfect for studying. The professors, while teaching multiple classes, still make themselves available for questions outside the classroom. They are never too busy to stop and chat if you see them around campus; they really care about your education and that you have a passion for what you are studying. Overall, Pitt is an amazing college to attend. The community surrounding the campus challenge you and support you all at once.

By using the trimester system, the school gives its students exposure to a large range of classes and material.
