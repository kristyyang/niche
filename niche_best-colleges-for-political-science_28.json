While working on my associates degree, I was able to take classes that easily transferred over to fulfill my bachelors degree requirements. This was very helpful to me because I didn't want to be put back in the 4 year college track. Saint Xavier also offers many scholarships and makes it very easy to set up a non interest payment plan throughout the year. What I would change about the school is that I would offer a greater variety of courses. I would also enjoy having more lounge space in the hallways since many of the students and myself are commuters. Furthermore, I would recommend the school to invest in finding a way to add more parking space because parking is always filled and very hard to find. Overall, I really enjoy the atmosphere and the small school setting, because the professors, students, and alumni are very welcoming and kind.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2017-10-12T19:26:36.229331Z","guid":"9b6614dd-2dbe-493c-ae0f-33d84487500c","rating":4},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":2.66}],"photos":{"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-87.713507,41.707763,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-87.713507,41.707763,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.5204819277108435,"count":830},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Chicago, IL"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/saint-xavier-university/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"4876c32f-ba5f-4b0c-b85e-bba60a2887e8","content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"St. John Fisher College","type":"College","url":"st-john-fisher-college"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.6454},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":27291},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"970-1150"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Senior","body":"Fisher is an excellent choice for teacher preparation!

Every time  I visit the campus, it seems more diverse and of course, that’s inspiring. I was a business major but the liberal arts aspects - learning to think deeply and to constantly question the answer with a critical view - is what this school is about. This school opens you up to making connections in material and in the real world. I went straight to NYC for a decade, two weeks after graduating from SMC. I will say that St Mary’s is a bubble; the school isn’t so much about teaching street smarts, but you can easily learn all things academic here, if you choose. Getting involved is key, too.

The downside is the food, it has gone downhill like 2 years ago since the operation got outsourced to a different company.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2018-01-20T00:44:47.088203Z","guid":"8dce985a-e527-4374-bdeb-49e1c02c2364","rating":5},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":2.66}],"photos":{"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-82.937867,39.954875,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-82.937867,39.954875,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.575685339690107,"count":839},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Columbus, OH"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/capital-university/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"d362130b-10d2-4a6a-8383-778916645da0","content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":true,"isPremium":false,"name":"University of Redlands","type":"College","url":"university-of-redlands"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.7475},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":34200},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"980-1190"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Freshman","body":"I'm just starting out as a freshman and so far I'm really pleased with the school.

Sociology is one of the most difficult (but rewarding!) disciplines, so I was not let down in that regard, and I loved having chapel and All School and floor worship nights, etc. The Office of Multicultural Development was what kept me going, tho -- OMD and my friends in MuKappa, which is now in the office of International Student Programs (ISP). Wheaton is sometimes called Whiteon for a reason. It is super white, super white evangelical, and that's what needs to change: diversity of race, ethnicity, and opinion needs to be valued from the TOP down. There's a good group of people striving for this, for Wheaton to be a welcoming home for all students, staff, and faculty, and for non-white/Western views to be taught in academics, etc, but that's not the reality yet.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2017-12-30T19:57:06.303423Z","guid":"d45345f3-a8f1-48ae-9d13-b9bcb390b355","rating":4},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":4}],"photos":{"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-88.09681,41.870943,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-88.09681,41.870943,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.884228187919463,"count":596},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Wheaton, IL"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/wheaton-college---illinois/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"36b7ed23-88e8-4cba-b032-180e591f9ac3","content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"Drury University","type":"College","url":"drury-university"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.6997},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":22181},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"1010-1220"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Sophomore","body":"I truly love attending Drury through the online program. I live in California and the professors work very well with students. I’ve had the flu and missed a week of assignments and the professors worked with me to make up my assignments. They are always available for questions and open to suggestions. It makes online learning fun and easy. At first I was nervous because I am a visual hands on learner but through the many resources and class discussions it helped my learn another way to learn. I truly recommend Drury!","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2017-12-21T02:42:50.208126Z","guid":"0f67a8d6-3409-4606-b459-b7e6f2403dfa","rating":5},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":3}],"photos":{"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-93.285773,37.219757,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-93.285773,37.219757,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.8683760683760684,"count":585},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Springfield, MO"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/drury-university/#scatterplot"}}]}
