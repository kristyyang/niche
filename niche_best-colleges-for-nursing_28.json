The staff is well trained, and majority of teachers are willing to meet with students to explain how they can do better in classes. The school also has weekly events for the students that are provident by SGA. These events are well liked by the students they provide a variety of events like BINGO and making pillows. As far as food goes on campus, the cafeteria has a selection of different food items like pizza, subs, etc. The campus also has two Starbucks which have the majority of the same items as a full sized shop.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2018-05-27T17:30:46.968662Z","guid":"47c98d73-1e45-4d65-8be2-934d933f85bb","rating":5},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":2}],"photos":{"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-83.887982,36.869066,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-83.887982,36.869066,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.452830188679245,"count":106},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Barbourville, KY"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/union-college---kentucky/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"43e479bb-ad14-4ae9-96c5-ae4eaf01ced3","content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"Lourdes University","type":"College","url":"lourdes-university"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.8934},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":19635},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"860-1100"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Niche User","body":"If i have ever loved a school so much! To be such a new and advancing University, the housing is literally an apartment complex. Also, there are so many options for people to do. There are so many opportunities for working, volunteering, traveling, and simply being involved. The LEAP crew hosts free programs like going to Lions games or Cedar Point. Also stuff like glow parties. I still have my TShirt from my freshman year of 2012. The RAs are very attentive. Jets has the greatest enployees and they help the students. There is always something going on in the Den. There is also an open door policy. If there is a door open, walk into it and say Hello!. I also love the FYE course. It encourages freshmen students to get involved with the school and to attened different events. They even take you camping for orientation which was 4 days of awesome.

But if you want to speak to almost everyone you pass on your way to class, have professors who take time to get to know you and will ask if y'all can catch up after you graduate, have the opportunity to take on leadership roles in your extra curricular activities, and become a part of a FAMILY, Averett should be your number one choice.\n\nThe professors and advisors are phenomenal. If you're wondering just how close of a relationship you make with the staff at Averett - my advisor has a picture of us hanging in her office from my senior pinning, and when going through a hard time in a leadership role, the president wrote me an encouraging handwritten letter.

Also, the professors I have had so far are very well educated and care about student success. The cafeteria food is average and excellent at times. Winter drags on a little too long, but there are many things to do outdoors like skiing, ice-skating, or playing hockey. The summer season is exceptional and makes the winter weather worth it. The only advice I would give is to make the most out of the opportunities given and get involved.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2018-05-04T03:16:51.522787Z","guid":"e1cba19f-94ce-472e-9f59-61e1d49bd48d","rating":4},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":2.66}],"photos":{"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-68.588364,47.250306,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-68.588364,47.250306,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.5567010309278353,"count":97},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Fort Kent, ME"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/university-of-maine-at-fort-kent/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"dc95e70e-3387-49f8-8615-50b7a38a40fa","content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"Mayville State University","type":"College","url":"mayville-state-university"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.5521},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":12104},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"693-915"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Senior","body":"I have had a great experience at Mayville State University.
