The campus itself is very old, but is newly renovated which gives it that antique feel.  It used to be an all women college, but has recently been opened up to men.  The architecture of the buildings is spectacular, and even more impressive, the school has underground tunnels!  I'm going for nursing, and the program guarantees you're out in four years with a degree which is extremely satisfying.  There are also a lot of hospitals near the campus which makes it super easy to complete my clinicals.  The only problem I have with the overall atmosphere is that it is still a blossoming campus, so it is quite small.  I'm from a small town so I'm familiar with the small-town feel, but it would be nice to be apart of a campus with more students at some point in the future.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2017-01-30T15:38:10.925906Z","guid":"6170eace-605b-49ef-814a-a23e385a18af","rating":4},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":2.66}],"photos":{"default":{"crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/fab1d8508676876a6778f15f5ba87c8d6fa832da.jpg","MobileHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/4ad0c7b5da1160250f3a0006ba1d9c92fc7264c7.jpg"},"licenseName":"UNLICENSED"},"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-90.691512,42.508619,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-90.691512,42.508619,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.592833876221498,"count":307},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Dubuque, IA"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/clarke-university/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"8a8c50fd-2a3b-45ea-9e86-c0d7e60bf252","content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":true,"isPremium":true,"name":"Southern Utah University","type":"College","url":"southern-utah-university"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.7228},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":14024},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"890-1150"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Senior","body":"I love this school!

Most of my professors see me around campus and remember my name. The campus food there is very delicious and there are lots to chose from. The dorms are very widespread and clean.

While working on my associates degree, I was able to take classes that easily transferred over to fulfill my bachelors degree requirements. This was very helpful to me because I didn't want to be put back in the 4 year college track. Saint Xavier also offers many scholarships and makes it very easy to set up a non interest payment plan throughout the year. What I would change about the school is that I would offer a greater variety of courses. I would also enjoy having more lounge space in the hallways since many of the students and myself are commuters. Furthermore, I would recommend the school to invest in finding a way to add more parking space because parking is always filled and very hard to find. Overall, I really enjoy the atmosphere and the small school setting, because the professors, students, and alumni are very welcoming and kind.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2017-10-12T19:26:36.229331Z","guid":"9b6614dd-2dbe-493c-ae0f-33d84487500c","rating":4},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":2.66}],"photos":{"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-87.713507,41.707763,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-87.713507,41.707763,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.5204819277108435,"count":830},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Chicago, IL"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/saint-xavier-university/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"07ac5cdc-466e-450b-a8d7-2046f380a805","content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"University of Toledo","type":"College","url":"university-of-toledo"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.9432},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":15919},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"920-1210"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Junior","body":"I feel as if I belong to something, versus my previous experience at a community college where I merely showed up, rarely talked to anyone, and then went home.

It is a beautiful school on a gorgeous mountain in rural Emmitsburg, MD. The small student to professor ratio gives each student the opportunity to personally get to know each professor and to build a professional, but personal relationship with each faculty and staff member. The other students and members of the Mount community including coaches, priests, seminarians, and alumni are very involved in the school and try to make the students feel a part of a larger community. I have enjoyed each moment at the Mount because it has become my home away from home! Seriously, I call it home even when I am away from it! If I had to go through the college selection process again, I would still choose the Mount. Even though it is an older school in a country area, the people have made my three years at the Mount feel like I am in the city on a new campus. The community definitely sets the Mount apart from the many schools I toured. I am Mount Proud!","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2017-11-30T03:54:50.244818Z","guid":"193f1d97-425f-46b3-9214-546772734555","rating":4},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":3}],"photos":{"default":{"crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/1d235b5d3cb2c026d54cf772b47c1d0a256e819e.jpg","MobileHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/70ff7048caf78c2787aa2db4e7c5a6b7fd5a9d73.jpg"},"licenseName":"UNLICENSED"},"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-77.35222,39.680632,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-77.35222,39.680632,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.4057142857142857,"count":700},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Emmitsburg, MD"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/mount-st-marys-university/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"284f501e-1074-4843-8441-a0d73684a675","content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"Chestnut Hill College","type":"College","url":"chestnut-hill-college"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.6447},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":24418},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"850-1070"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Graduate Student","body":"I've had an excellent experience at Chestnut Hill as a graduate student in the Clinical and Counseling Psychology program. The program has an excellent reputation in the area for turning out graduates who are extremely prepared to immediately begin working in the field. Many of my professors are practicing clinicians, and I find their direct experience to be very helpful in the classroom. I also love that CHC offers so many concentrations within the program- many more than any other graduate program I looked at!","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2018-05-14T18:01:54.994532Z","guid":"6592b802-308b-49c5-83d9-6067a568007e","rating":4},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":2.33}],"photos":{"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-75.228847,40.087048,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-75.228847,40.087048,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.4854881266490767,"count":379},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Philadelphia, PA"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/chestnut-hill-college/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"b84535ba-be32-4f39-acdd-4511bc675a24","content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"Westfield State University","type":"College","url":"westfield-state-university"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.7792},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":15593},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"890-1090"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Sophomore","body":"It's been very fun here meeting all the friends I have made and bring part of the track and field team as a thrower.
