As a freshman, Whitworth was really great with helping me adapt to the big changes that come with college. Specifically at Whitworth, I have really enjoyed the traditiation for freshmen and all the events that it contained. I really enjoyed the events on campus during weekends. I wish the price could be cheaper so that it was easier to enjoy such a great education at Whitworth. I have met great friends who would probably answer the same as me. Another improvement I think Whitworth could make is making sure that students are able to understand how to get a job once they have finished college. This might be an improvement with the advisers but I think students need help with stress and knowing we can find stable careers out of college that correspond with our majors.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2016-07-13T23:12:11Z","guid":"d41405c1-67df-4aea-88ec-c750f90fc98d","rating":4},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":3.66}],"photos":{"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-117.418078,47.753699,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-117.418078,47.753699,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.9413145539906105,"count":852},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Spokane, WA"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/whitworth-university/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"f3315e60-decf-4d24-9051-86c3a287a693","content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":true,"isPremium":true,"name":"Trinity University - Texas","type":"College","url":"trinity-university---texas"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.4066},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":28569},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"1160-1370"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Sophomore","body":"I am an international student at Trinity.\n\nTrinity has furnished me with countless great memories.

Astrophysics is a growing field here and there are plenty of research opportunities here. However, it is one of the smaller programs on campus. Even so, you will find plenty of other astrophysics students to hang out with and the professors are great. Dr. Trainor is an awesome professor to have, but there are a lot of other great physics professors as well. \nThe music program is incredible. The faculty are all friendly people who you quickly come to trust. There is a great diversity in music ensembles, but it is a small school, so you get all of the drawbacks of that. All instruments are represented and you won't feel extreme pressure like you would for smaller ensembles.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2018-04-24T20:17:50.936072Z","guid":"0054fe78-eecc-424e-8e10-10103c75dbc3","rating":4},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":4.33}],"photos":{"default":{"crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/cfba010af8f7961d2fa9d333907e9304995d5826.jpg","MobileHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/0556c30bb788fe8071c3cda4085f7416d2f83393.jpg","Thumbnail":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/62d957295f2e31a47657e17bf6d88864e5b215cf"},"licenseName":"UNLICENSED"},"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-76.319037,40.048045,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-76.319037,40.048045,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.6297709923664123,"count":786},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Lancaster, PA"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/franklin--and--marshall-college/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"9d56b986-2303-4209-8b21-669e0cd89cb3","content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":true,"isPremium":false,"name":"Gustavus Adolphus College","type":"College","url":"gustavus-adolphus-college"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.648},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":24293},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"1080-1340"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Freshman","body":"Wonderful community that fostered both my desire for success and my need for higher education.

I appreciate Luther's diversity, with a large international student population, but I often find myself wishing there was more diversity in experience and opinion in my classes. \nWorking with the housing system at Luther was not always the easiest or best experience when trying to manage toxic rooming situations, and think the housing application should be updated, and procedures changed to give students more flexibility.\nOverall, I have had a good experience at Luther, and hope that it will only improve in the years to come.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2018-03-24T19:47:15.968459Z","guid":"0d909646-455d-4fc2-bf14-56e9e4723de3","rating":4},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":4}],"photos":{"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-91.803971,43.313584,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-91.803971,43.313584,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.6958456973293767,"count":674},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Decorah, IA"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/luther-college/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"e5c0272a-a098-492f-829a-b1bca6f76e4b","content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"Susquehanna University","type":"College","url":"susquehanna-university"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.677},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":26561},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"1020-1230"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Junior","body":"The students at Susquehanna University will come to be wonderful friends of yours.

It is definitely a very liberal campus so may be difficult for conservative students but this climate definitely challenges conservative students to clearly think through their opinions and convictions, ultimately molding everyone to be a more careful thinker, more articulate speaker and writer, and better global citizen.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2018-02-23T13:41:41.112665Z","guid":"887a2db1-f1aa-4ddd-b666-7a87fd8bcae3","rating":5},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":4}],"photos":{"default":{"crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/23de020ed1f1e711fce623b93d51658fd31845ef.jpg","MobileHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/ae7e258edc46e9db455df5d463c1be2ae7c17d43.jpg","Thumbnail":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/be9a22e0a8a992cf1aec55766e9178fe18c527dc"},"licenseName":"UNLICENSED"},"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-118.210783,34.126224,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-118.210783,34.126224,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.6056338028169015,"count":426},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Los Angeles, CA"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/occidental-college/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"5ac44d87-3d43-47da-9d71-ad8f67450be3","content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"North Greenville University","type":"College","url":"north-greenville-university"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.5912},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":15864},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"910-1310"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Freshman","body":"I absolutely love it here! All of the professors really care about their students, and their success. I love being able to attend chapel every Monday and Wednesday mornings.

Everyone is very friendly and welcoming. The professors do everything in their power to try to help you in class. Whether it is getting help on an upcoming exam, explaining the assignments, or simply giving advice, they always make themselves available. There is always fun activities happening on campus as well. People come together to enjoy sports, holidays, dances, club activities, and many more things! Having the opportunity to study abroad is also a bonus.

I am now pursuing post-graduate studies at a big University and the resources available to students, professor expertise, and quality of coursework is inferior to Colby in almost every way. Colby students are friendly, extremely intelligent, and well-rounded. Most of my friends volunteered, had an on-campus job or worked in a lab, and actively participated in campus clubs. The Colby bubble can become a little suffocating, as it is easy to not leave campus for weeks, but I am honestly sad I will never be in such a tight-knit community of similar-minded peers again. Colby is not perfect by all means, but it's a damn good school. If you choose to go to Colby, go in with an open mind, positive attitude, and readiness to introduce yourself to a million people.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2017-12-29T03:27:58.977015Z","guid":"bfdf69be-e5e9-4bb4-9ef6-0d01bd59e2e7","rating":4},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":4.33}],"photos":{"default":{"crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/dfdaf6431156601d8dae33ecab8f2ffe44140ae0.jpg","MobileHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/033e87f66b4397f2d715ed17e562a91b10c0024d.jpg","Thumbnail":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/1b8ae1cb324d4beb19924b807180732918207245"},"licenseName":"UNLICENSED"},"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-69.66337,44.564211,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-69.66337,44.564211,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.72635814889336,"count":497},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Waterville, ME"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/colby-college/#scatterplot"}}]}
