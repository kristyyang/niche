The class styles are generally a form of lecture, but they are engaging. Professors make an effort to entertain and motivate their students. The majority of music professors are great examples of how teachers should be as role models.

With that being said the array of extracurricular activities available to students is fantastic. Greek life on this campus to me is one of the best in the country and one of the most wonderful organizations I've had the opportunity to be apart of. It not only provides an inclusiveness towards other organizations and the campus as a whole, but encourages students to work harder in both academia and community service. Along with Greek life this university has also provided many leadership opportunities that I wouldn't have had, had I gone somewhere else. While diversity on this campus tends to be lacking I was able to work with different multicultural organizations to change that aspect. All in all the University of Maine is a school worth attending if you have a specific plan.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2018-04-09T19:43:53.955304Z","guid":"d4139b76-2ad0-4055-baef-a319c6145b2f","rating":4},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":3}],"photos":{"default":{"crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/a4bf3efc1a87174e1309c2eb31a3ec49183286e3.jpg","MobileHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/c774187efe47ea9fb1599fc367c7d043324b3c9a.jpg"},"licenseName":"UNLICENSED"},"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-68.673839,44.895966,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-68.673839,44.895966,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.4721052631578946,"count":1900},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Orono, ME"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/university-of-maine/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"eb0e57da-6ba2-4998-a94f-bb36fe0f5767","content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"Tarleton State University","type":"College","url":"tarleton-state-university"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.5039},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":10615},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"850-1050"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Freshman","body":"Tarleton is a very welcoming college straight from the start.

I joined a sorority my first year and through that I have gained friends who encouraged me to get involved on campus in areas that I'm interested in and in organizations that they thought I would like. Because of the wonderful people at LaTech, I've been a member of leadership team at my church, the Student Government Association, Bulldogs for Life, AED PreMed Society, and many honor societies. The friends I've made here see the potential in me and push me to apply for leadership positions on campus. I'm pre-med and as I've gotten older, I've grown close to other students in my major and they are a HUGE support system for me because we share notes, advice, and prepare for things like interviews together. I can't think of much that I would change. I would like for the Pre-Med/Pre-Dent Advisory Committee interviews to be offered in the fall quarter instead of just once a year in the spring quarter.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2018-03-09T02:06:08.705378Z","guid":"8602bb74-934b-4133-9934-2dada4efdc51","rating":5},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":3.66}],"photos":{"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-92.64964,32.525518,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-92.64964,32.525518,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.6758241758241756,"count":910},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Ruston, LA"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/louisiana-tech-university/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"f4eda9c6-285a-4f42-83ea-11485a82197e","content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"Central Connecticut State University","type":"College","url":"central-connecticut-state-university"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.6001},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":14852},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"900-1100"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Alum","body":"I attended Central Connecticut State University (CCSU) for two and a half years. During this time, I acquired my Bachelor of Arts in Social Work while receiving a  minor in Psychological Science. One thing I noticed while enrolled at the university is that the teachers were very proactive in ensuring the best learning environment for their students. I found that the professors made themselves available to students who needed extra time outside of classroom time to process materials being taught in class. As a young African American Woman, I was further impressed by not only the diversity of the university's  faculty but also their students. Overall, my experience at CCSU was positive. The only thing I would change is for the university to be as considerate to traditional students as they are to non-traditional students as it relates to class availablity.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2018-02-02T15:20:29.113994Z","guid":"ec08d80e-79bf-40e3-b696-0782ce36de86","rating":4},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":2.66}],"photos":{"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-72.770094,41.690258,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-72.770094,41.690258,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.3884156729131174,"count":1174},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"New Britain, CT"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/central-connecticut-state-university/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"051b166a-6312-4446-a9ae-2258a40ed137","content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":true,"isPremium":true,"name":"Colorado Mesa University","type":"College","url":"colorado-mesa-university"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.8275},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":13529},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"870-1090"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Sophomore","body":"Colorado Mesa University was the right choice for me and I'm sure it is for you too.

Weather you like hiking, mountain biking, skiing, paddle boarding you name it then CMU is the right choice for you. And even if you've never done any of those thing CMU has a wonderful Outdoors program that will take you on trips and teach you the basics. Outdoors activites not for you that's okay we have a great rec gym with racquetball courts, basketball courts, rock climbing wall and even a Olympic size swimming pool.

I cannot begin to tell you the opportunities available here nor what you will learn from working and studying alongside people from all over the world.

Because social -- and often intellectual -- life centers around student organizations, I've had the chance to meet people who share my passions. In lieu of Greek life, student organizations host parties that foster a sense of community that centers around something deeper than hazing or a few Greek letters. The professors are caring and encourage you to think for yourself. Another thing I want to emphasize is the effect of Jesuit values. I was hesitant about them coming in because I'm not religious, but Georgetown doesn't shove religion down your throat.

The campus is beautiful and provides so many opportunities for every student. My first semester at Austin Peay, I was so involved on campus that I was there every day of every week. I got involved at the Foy Fitness Center in an aerial silks class. I really appreciated that the two instructors were involved with each student and pushed each of us to the best of our abilities. I also got accepted into Sigma Kappa, the new sorority on campus. Being in Sigma Kappa was the one of the best things that had ever happened to me. It formed me into a social butterfly and allowed me to really help out in the community. The women of Sigma Kappa came together to host events with other sororities to bring people together for charity. Being at APSU has transformed my life in the most amazing ways.

Of course, people will always complain and say that the \"rich white people\" surround SLU. However, if you actually try and engage in the SLU community you will find more than just that. SLU has given me life long friends and an education that I am proud of. So far my classes have gone well and are usually well taught. If there are any complaints, there are always surveys at the end of the semester that go straight to the department heads for review. Finding the right college for you is difficult. I was lucky enough to fall in love with SLU as soon as I visited. I definitely suggest visiting and doing an overnight to see if SLU is right for you.

The bluffs are beautiful and the nearby Lake allows the community to kayak and more for a small yearly fee.  The campus is really pretty and has been updated in a lot of ways--there is a caribou coffee and snack shop in the library (the library is beautiful, spacious, and bright btw!), they have added another newer coffee shop in Somsen Hall as well.  Yes like all colleges there are a lot of old buildings, but they have charm and history.  The Wellness Center is amazing--relatively updated and very modern looking.    The food court has also been remodeled and looks great as well.  Overall, I had a great time at the school--true, the city of Winona is a little bland, there is the typical movie theater and a couple restaurants that aren't chains, but its a small town.  Typically, people can travel to La Crosse or Rochester for the nearest mall or other adventures.  Honestly though, Winona State is beautiful and a pretty great school.

There are always professors, general staff and faculty that advertise and  support the struggling student. These supports are not limited to academics, but extends all the way to financial struggles as well. Lehman is a great campus, however, there are always improvements to be made. One of the improvements I wish to see in Cuny Lehman is the extension of campus space.

Its campus is BEAUTIFUL; we have lush gardens and there are so many birds here, from towhees to even the occasional hawk. The opportunities here to get involved are almost overwhelming. We have this program called DukeEngage where students go to all parts of the world to work with communities through research and volunteer work. I will actually be going to Costa Rica this summer to help in rainforest restoratuon and conservation through this  program!But what I truly love most about this school is its students. The atmosphere here is not competitive but collaborative. I came to Duke feeling insecure about my qualifications compared to those of the other incoming freshman. But never once did I feel belittled or patronized. Students here want each other to succeed, we want to see each other grow and challenge ourselves to improve.
