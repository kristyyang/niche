On orientation day the staff made me feel so welcome, everyone was so friendly, and not because they had to be, it was truly genuine! The actual DEAN of my department spent over an hour with me helping to map out my first semester by going over different course selections available for me, helping to make sure I didn't waste time or money picking classes that would not benefit my intended major. The academics are challenging and many employers see Stockton University as a highly credited institution to graduate from. I highly recommend any student looking for a college where they will easily fit in and belong. There are so many activities to keep busy and because Stockton is situated in the heart of South Jersey, its relatively close to anything you could need.

Even though there is roughly 25,000 students, the layout of the campus makes you feel like the school is not that big! There are a lot of activities to do and it's very easy to make friends and meet new people.

It is a liberal arts college meaning that they focus on teaching the students the importance of learning multiple subjects rather than having expertise in only one area. The school has the Integrated Studies course that everyone is required to take. Freshmen take \"Introduction to Liberal Arts,\" sophomores take \"Global Perspectives,\" juniors take \"Reflections,\" and seniors take a course on \"Citizenship.\" These courses help the students become aware of their communities and get them involved in helping to make the world a more welcoming and overall a better place. Because the school is in a very small town, it is not as diverse as other schools closer to the cities and big towns. However, everyone is welcoming and very helpful. They emphasize the importance of helping one another and the professors are excellent in helping their students achieve and reach their highest potential.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2018-01-20T05:12:47.114922Z","guid":"0cd35397-14df-4fdf-ac0f-35ddc8617049","rating":4},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":3}],"photos":{"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-90.637909,40.91459,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-90.637909,40.91459,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.4891944990176817,"count":509},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Monmouth, IL"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/monmouth-college/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"2a9752c5-57f8-4872-a1aa-3d4db49305fa","content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"Penn State Lehigh Valley","type":"College","url":"penn-state-lehigh-valley"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.8665},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":13165},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"900-1180"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Freshman","body":"There are a lot of free things at penn state lehigh valley and a lot of cheap activities.

Not only do they offer an abundance of scholarships to aid your education, but they offer a wide selection of classes as well. This has helped me as I work full time so the online and night courses they offer have been a perfect fit. But most importantly, Western Kentucky feels like home. This university is a community that welcomes everyone with open arms, and I’m a proud Hilltopper!","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2017-12-29T03:26:02.359593Z","guid":"6f869d95-fa69-49af-9fdf-3993ddcad022","rating":5},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":2.66}],"photos":{"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-86.455898,36.985718,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-86.455898,36.985718,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.640641158221303,"count":1934},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Bowling Green, KY"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/western-kentucky-university/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"683b3026-92d9-4382-bc68-53ed6ecdb680","content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"California State University - Sacramento","type":"College","url":"california-state-university---sacramento"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.7194},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":9127},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"830-1050"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Sophomore","body":"I've been at Sacramento State since Fall 2016 and I really like it here. The campus is real beautiful; coming from LA, I've never seen so many trees in one spot. The professors I've had have been great and I've taken away valuable information from their classes and applied that information to my everyday life. One thing I do wish was different would be the amount of students that are accepted. With so many students here, it's very difficult to get into the classes necessary to graduate. There are a lot of impacted majors, but that is because the programs Sac State offers have to be some of the best in the country; so, it's understandable. Other than that, Sac State is a very great school. Everyone here, including the staff, is very friendly and willing to help others out when they're lost or have any questions about anything. I'm glad to be a hornet!","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2018-02-06T21:45:43.94191Z","guid":"138c54b3-27d1-451c-8e93-d8f26e84bf75","rating":4},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":3}],"photos":{"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-121.42194,38.55745,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-121.42194,38.55745,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.595684803001876,"count":3198},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Sacramento, CA"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/california-state-university---sacramento/#scatterplot"}}]}
