Professors and school staff are friendly and supportive. Beaches are close by for breaks.\nThe Bad: Laulima website used by almost every professor crashes often and can cramp your style in a major way so work should be turned in well before deadlines to avoid this. Also, the beaches can eat up your entire day so maybe study first. \nThe Ugly: Tuition is insane. Highly recommend finding places to donate plasma/blood/etc or do some busking to help with tuition. If tuition doesn't scare you, the housing costs will for sure.

This university has been able to provide helpful resources like CAPS tutoring and awesome organizations to get involved in. I'm currently in the ASUNM Community Experience group, where we've been able to  connect with a diverse amount of people by volunteering and helping out within the university and Albuquerque. Living on campus has also been an incredible experience because of our close net community.

It is very diverse with people from all around the world. The professors are very helpful and there is a common theme of \"the mission to education\" where every person is working with another to improve the educational experience for everyone. \nAlthough having large classes might be an advantage for some people, it minimizes the interaction between the students, which could be improved. Students don't interact very well in classes and rely on extracurricular activities or living on campus to get to know more people. Additionally, another area where the university can improve is the campus food!

When everything is in bloom it's gorgeous, and when everything is gross and snowy and just a mess, they tell you to stay home so nobody gets hurt. They're always improving something. Mental health is an actual concern for them, and they have free counseling services too! So is physical health, and they have a clinic you can get your prescriptions or a check up at. My professors so far are amazing and accommodating, and I adore the classes despite some of them being difficult.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2018-02-02T03:57:32.480614Z","guid":"2b7e0093-623b-4d85-ba8b-bd2e7e408db3","rating":5},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":3.33}],"photos":{"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-89.33791,31.327499,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-89.33791,31.327499,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.662516382699869,"count":1526},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Hattiesburg, MS"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/university-of-southern-mississippi/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"1fd179ec-4daf-4024-9266-198805d9bbcf","content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"Stephen F Austin State University","type":"College","url":"stephen-f-austin-state-university"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.6245},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":11987},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"870-1090"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Sophomore","body":"Stephen F. Austin is located in a small city with not much to do, which is its biggest downfall, however everything else is exceptional. The professors are overly nice, welcoming, and really do care about the success of their students. I have not met one professor who doesn’t want to help their students. Besides academics, the athletic department is amazing. SFA is LOUD! We have soooo much school spirit, and win at almost everything. Everyone I have met so far has been very nice and you make new friends everyday.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2018-03-01T21:23:51.063271Z","guid":"d78ccd1d-8358-449e-898d-91402876ae4b","rating":4},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":3}],"photos":{"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-94.58546,31.58562,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-94.58546,31.58562,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.6658364466583646,"count":2409},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Nacogdoches, TX"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/stephen-f-austin-state-university/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"d8183760-7ab8-44e9-9f89-e149bf4e942f","content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"North Carolina A&T State University","type":"College","url":"north-carolina-a-and-t-state-university"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.5364},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":9548},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"850-1010"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Senior","body":"North Carolina A&T was not my first choice, but I am delighted I chose this school. I have networked with so many individuals and made a lot of life-long friendships. I didn't, however, feel challenged until my junior year of college which is unfortunate, but that may be different with some people. Some teachers really took interests in helping students while others didn't. With academics and professors, I feel could be better along with the food options as well. However, all around NCAT is a good school and it was a great choice!","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2018-05-19T14:14:40.886379Z","guid":"e481aec3-0209-47aa-9ff1-80e1af9298e2","rating":4},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":3.33}],"photos":{"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-79.770152,36.076737,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-79.770152,36.076737,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.602803738317757,"count":2568},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Greensboro, NC"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/north-carolina-a-and-t-state-university/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"6cf54128-3f4c-44a8-b0da-73a675a7e456","content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"South Dakota State University","type":"College","url":"south-dakota-state-university"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.9076},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":21421},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"890-1160"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Junior","body":"South Dakota State University is a place I have been able to grow and succeed in my college career so far.
