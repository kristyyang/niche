I enjoyed being a tutor for one of ACU's classes and was an employee for the on-campus tech support for the entire length of my time at ACU. My professors all really cared about me and my wellbeing. My greatest disappointment with ACU lies with its recently announced policy regarding LGBT student employees as its discriminating and distasteful rhetoric doesn't reflect the actual opinion of the campus population (my engagement with professors, staff, and students and observance of the collective outrage over the policy has confirmed as much for me). As an LGBT student who had an active role in multiple campus positions, it was greatly disappointing to learn the administration's recent decision. I hope that they will revoke this discriminating change, as the community here is really accepting and loving. Many allies rose up over the past semester to challenge the policy and were seen wearing pride pins to graduation.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2018-05-31T23:37:57.218646Z","guid":"4241b7bc-6a52-4584-9ba8-e9b02129bd21","rating":4},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":3.33}],"photos":{"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-99.70954,32.46915,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-99.70954,32.46915,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.68,"count":1225},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Abilene, TX"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/abilene-christian-university/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"c9ee53f1-ee41-46e0-a9dd-350d34faa3e2","badge":{"display":"Best Colleges for Religious Studies in America","ordinal":57,"total":197,"vanityURL":"best-colleges-for-religious-studies"},"content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"Eastern University","type":"College","url":"eastern-university"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.6119},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":22877},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"930-1140"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Sophomore","body":"I love the close knit community Eastern University offers.

They host many events to get to know others so being so far from home wasn’t that big of a deal. The athletic team and trainers are amazing. I injured my knee and my coach and trainers have been so supportive. I will be back on the field next year! There isn’t a contained campus but I was able to live in the dorms a block away from the academic building which was nice. Next year I will have to live further away which isn’t as convenient. I would recommend everyone have a car. Grocery shopping isn’t within walking distance and neither is the fields for sports. There is a Starbucks in the bookstore! It would be nice if the cafeteria was open more hours for athletes schedules. I can walk to a church I like on Sundays. I would recommend Point University! Soon more buildings will be up as they have proposed, that will be nice. The band is excellent, winning many awards.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2018-05-03T11:37:20.510041Z","guid":"6f700d02-bcd0-48f2-990e-6ba3565b358a","rating":5},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":2.66}],"photos":{"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-85.184285,32.879467,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-85.184285,32.879467,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.7888446215139444,"count":251},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"West Point, GA"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/point-university/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"c1f218c4-23b3-45f5-ac04-bb136e1fd6aa","badge":{"display":"Best Colleges for Religious Studies in America","ordinal":61,"total":197,"vanityURL":"best-colleges-for-religious-studies"},"content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"Azusa Pacific University","type":"College","url":"azusa-pacific-university"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.6146},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":28506},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"900-1130"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Alum","body":"As a small liberal arts college, Azusa Pacific University is like a hole-in-the-wall college that's a hidden gem.

In the \"Grease Pit\", on the opposite side of the high way lining campus, there are more fast-food restaurants than you could even count on all your fingers and toes. In addition to the campus life and eateries, Baylor is the only university also certified as a zoo. With the two live bears, Joy and Lady, the campus is lit up by their presence as true mascots.

I wish the price could be cheaper so that it was easier to enjoy such a great education at Whitworth. I have met great friends who would probably answer the same as me. Another improvement I think Whitworth could make is making sure that students are able to understand how to get a job once they have finished college.

Professors have extremely high expectations for their students, however they do everything in their power to build your way to those high expectations. It can be difficult to find a study/social life balance. If you cannot develop strong study habits, classes will be a struggle. There are a ton of resources available to students who haven't established study habits and professors are happy to work with students. The open-door policy is an awesome thing to take advantage of.

Students are encouraged to grow in their relationships with Jesus and others, and it is a wonderful school!","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2018-02-06T18:31:34.072974Z","guid":"a1f6d3bb-7d0f-4c13-b53c-2e3c21bbf8c1","rating":5},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":2.66}],"photos":{"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-87.882722,42.197909,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-87.882722,42.197909,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.457680250783699,"count":319},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Deerfield, IL"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/trinity-international-university---deerfield/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"02eb2aa2-9aad-4c72-8653-f2d741d4a7f0","badge":{"display":"Best Colleges for Religious Studies in America","ordinal":76,"total":197,"vanityURL":"best-colleges-for-religious-studies"},"content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"Manhattan Christian College","type":"College","url":"manhattan-christian-college"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.5951},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":12156},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"890-980"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"College Junior","body":"I absolutely love MCC! It's a small college, but KSU is right across the street and offers a duel degree program and advisers work well with each student to figure out the best path for their life. Also, it is expensive especially if you're paying for college by yourself, so the adviser help with finding grants, loans, and other types of scholarships! \r\n\r\nMCC has many extracurricular activities to choose from as well. So not only to I get to study what I love, I also get to be involved in the sport that I love, along with clubs that best for my personality. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nJust one example of why I love MCC: we are a Christian College so I have that right to study what I believe as well as non-religion classes, but that also means that when one studen is in trouble or is going through a rough time the community at MCC goes out of their way to be there for that person. My freshmen year, a guy had lost his grandmother and the student government bought him a plane ticket to make it back for the funeral. He didn't have the money and with how far away he lived no one could come get him. As a student government member now I will never forget how much that small act meant to him! And that's why I love MCC.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2016-07-29T08:21:42Z","guid":"3d109ac6-c561-4e96-8e75-565a4c073fae","rating":5},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":2.66}],"photos":{"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-96.579018,39.185764,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-96.579018,39.185764,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.7083333333333335,"count":96},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Manhattan, KS"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/manhattan-christian-college/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"1d0fb976-abc7-4109-8e0a-4db5d766f8b5","badge":{"display":"Best Colleges for Religious Studies in America","ordinal":77,"total":197,"vanityURL":"best-colleges-for-religious-studies"},"content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"North Park University","type":"College","url":"north-park-university"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.9418},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":20076},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"872-1160"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Sophomore","body":"North Park University is a really great campus to get your college education.  It is full of the latest technology and is full of diversity.  I feel these are what makes this university so unique!  The professors are extremely caring and are always willing to help out if needed.  It is located in Chicago which is definitely a plus.  There are so many things to learn about and explore in this big city.  The people are truly amazing and this makes my college experience so rewarding.  The opportunities are endless. North Park is located near the home of the Chicago Cubs!  It was an awesome feeling to be part of the World Series 2016!  I am only a sophomore at North Park, and I hope I am given the opportunity to graduate from here.  The tuition is very expensive for me, but I'm trying my best to get really good grades and apply for available scholarships.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2017-02-03T01:22:23.039851Z","guid":"91d8730a-4e15-432d-a05f-ae559df227f5","rating":5},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":3}],"photos":{"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-87.709142,41.9751,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-87.709142,41.9751,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.5990338164251208,"count":621},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Chicago, IL"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/north-park-university/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"3d4d84ba-016b-4819-b6dc-93f4bcec8ad1","badge":{"display":"Best Colleges for Religious Studies in America","ordinal":78,"total":197,"vanityURL":"best-colleges-for-religious-studies"},"content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":true,"isPremium":false,"name":"Ozark Christian College","type":"College","url":"ozark-christian-college"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":1},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":14560},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"910-1135"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Niche User","body":"It's an amazing university!
