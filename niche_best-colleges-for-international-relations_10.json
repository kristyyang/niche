As a psychology major it is hard to get into classes you need as they close out, even if you came in with a ton of AP credits. Also, so many classes are big so its harder to focus and do well in them. The campus is hilly. Academics are great, i’ve only had one bad teacher. Advising sucks I had to figure everything out on my own. Mountainview dorms were awfull, invisible RA, no community events, unfriendly people etc. Now I live in Newing and I love it and it’s so much better! Many Long Island students, intentational students (mostly from Asia) and Jewish students. You have to find your people at this school but once you do your experience can be great. Also, we don’t have certain majors like education (also communications, and others people complain about) which really sucks but they try to sell you on their grad program. The food is hit or miss, definitely go to the Kosher station since they have the best food.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2018-05-23T01:30:53.174035Z","guid":"98f168b2-72e9-48d0-bb5e-1cc0fdef30f8","rating":4},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":3.66}],"photos":{"default":{"crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/843cc93be5f59a4bf97adb882d92fccaf932660b.jpg","MobileHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/e1bba7684cb59ca91b80ae5381f80c29566dec0c.jpg"},"licenseName":"UNLICENSED"},"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-75.971143,42.088049,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-75.971143,42.088049,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.5464154411764706,"count":2176},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Vestal, NY"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/binghamton-university-suny/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"ae6adb6f-0375-4baa-9e19-ba05caac2fcf","content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"Bowling Green State University","type":"College","url":"bowling-green-state-university"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.7605},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":17313},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"900-1150"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Freshman","body":"I love Bowling Green State University!

This is my new home and I cannot say enough about how much I love Oakland University.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2018-05-22T15:18:05.389064Z","guid":"da55ae83-8873-4431-ad77-7e55441c147e","rating":5},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":3}],"photos":{"default":{"crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/38bb3c2a072a04df0ce139e7a6302e149971ae26.jpg","MobileHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/00242be1486640f3bb87d5c367426eec7e83c9a1.jpg"},"licenseName":"UNLICENSED"},"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-83.218866,42.672586,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-83.218866,42.672586,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.489578284052351,"count":2063},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Rochester, MI"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/oakland-university/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"e86b1196-1af9-41c3-b6c4-095f12ea1f0a","content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"Eastern Michigan University","type":"College","url":"eastern-michigan-university"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.7288},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":14268},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"910-1140"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Junior","body":"I love this school.  It tends to have a bad reputation, especially from where I come from, but I have nothing but great things to say about it.  Campus culture is very work oriented, many people here are ready to really earn their way to what they want to do.  Eastern is very community based, and that is shown in Ypsilanti, and the kind people around you.  Very diverse student body.  EMU tends to be too focused on the work at times, which is never a bad thing, but we could learn to relax.  You have to work to get the experience that you want.  Don't expect to pay tuition and love it - get involved, talk to your professors, do community service, look into study abroad, talk to your classmates, do research!

There are a number of housing options once you decide you're done with dorm life, including many homes for rent in the area. I like that we are taught by the professors and not aides. I appreciate that we don't have to be entered onto a waiting list for entry into specialized studies pertaining to our majors. I do feel that Whitewater athletics should be recognized more statewide, as we have some of the best athletes/teams around!

One problem I do I have is with the parking situations, there is hardly any parking.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2018-04-30T19:51:02.422179Z","guid":"3e935fe3-ada3-4ee6-885c-384ba5f0b035","rating":4},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":3}],"photos":{"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-88.18189,30.695081,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-88.18189,30.695081,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.668091168091168,"count":1404},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Mobile, AL"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/university-of-south-alabama/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"68e77f22-ad27-473f-acd6-7a228732577f","content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"University of Maryland - Baltimore County","type":"College","url":"university-of-maryland---baltimore-county"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.5683},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":15349},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"1120-1320"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Junior","body":"UMBC meets its claim to \"top public college in America\" within the first week. Even as a commuter, \"welcome week\" was the perfect break-me-out-of-my-shell experience I needed to feel comfortable in going to college here, at UMBC. And it didn't stop there! Every semester the school creates a new way to include its students from all walks of life. There are many organizations that are eager to gain new recruits; there are always emails and chalk drawings that invite people to join the UMBC community or show your Retriever Pride; and there are so many safe, private places to study or just relax without feeling like you're in the middle of nowhere.\nNot to mention you are a short bus-ride away from plenty of off-campus attractions, if you ever feel the need to escape campus life (many of these excursions are even organized by  the Student Events Board). \nThis is the perfect small campus, with a big college feel. I highly recommend going here.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2018-02-28T21:11:50.413584Z","guid":"5cd42f0d-d5f9-4239-9993-d85b27f54680","rating":4},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":3.33}],"photos":{"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-76.711607,39.256686,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-76.711607,39.256686,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.456090651558074,"count":1765},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Baltimore, MD"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/university-of-maryland---baltimore-county/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"efd24293-d300-4f65-93e9-dbb7b1b981ba","content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":true,"isPremium":false,"name":"East Tennessee State University","type":"College","url":"east-tennessee-state-university"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.9164},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":14915},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"920-1130"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Senior","body":"Overall, I have been impressed with the type of experiences I have been able to receive at East Tennessee State University. As I am studying to be a future teacher, I have had many opportunities to work with young students at the University School on campus. This has allowed me to gain experience with students by actually doing my lesson plans with real students. Almost all of my professors have been enthusiastic and passionate about the content they have been teaching, which creates a more engaging classroom. The campus has many different options for food and entertainment, with weekly emails about upcoming events. With over 200 student clubs and organizations, there are plenty of opportunities to get involved on campus, make friends, and develop new skills!","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2018-05-04T19:30:36.560392Z","guid":"8736eb2d-2c3e-4a1a-a1d5-f91d959a02b0","rating":4},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":2.66}],"photos":{"default":{"crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/234b885f667940d55c4cf97c66c68ac986caabfd.jpg","MobileHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/c4bbcc2a986339b80984764a6cfea7a03ed13430.jpg"},"licenseName":"UNLICENSED"},"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-82.366954,36.301643,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-82.366954,36.301643,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.598621877691645,"count":1161},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Johnson City, TN"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/east-tennessee-state-university/#scatterplot"}}]}
