Coming from two states over, this is the perfect place to learn to start living on your own, as the campus is easy to navigate, safe, and diverse. While I have heard there are some less than perfect profs on campus, mine have been nothing but kind and extremely intelligent. I am a part of TUs choirs, and my experience there has also been positive, however on the athletics front, although I do not care for sports, I have heard from friends who are involved that they're not the best, namely the Equestrian Team. The food also gets tiring and disappointing, but they have their days, i.e. Taco Tueaday. Overall, my first year on campus has been successful, and I would recommend this uni to my friends.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2018-04-25T06:58:44.975914Z","guid":"37ffa23b-b23e-424b-a05f-2a6f48b32e98","rating":4},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":2.33}],"photos":{"default":{"crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/530d5360f0bd422fda50f8e405df4ed7548ea99a.jpg","MobileHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/ce71674f2e3278ccffcd89792f967c9bbe9617f2.jpg"},"licenseName":"UNLICENSED"},"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-83.18355,41.119193,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-83.18355,41.119193,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.557404326123128,"count":601},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Tiffin, OH"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/tiffin-university/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"22a5900b-ae88-4148-bc58-c35bb8f187d0","content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"University of South Carolina - Beaufort","type":"College","url":"university-of-south-carolina---beaufort"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.6513},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":14592},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"840-1030"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Freshman","body":"Just from attending USC-Beaufort for one semester I have found that I love the environment on campus and off campus.

The majority of my professors were not only exceptionally helpful, but also available and flexible when it came to making time for students. Obviously, no place is perfect, and there were some minor butting of heads between the different schools of study within Alfred, which at times would carry into the students perceptions, but overall everyone managed to get along fairly well, regardless of major, race, gender, orientation and the such. It should be noted that the school has an excellent exchange program for those coming from overseas.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2018-03-02T21:43:12.429078Z","guid":"930ead6b-37f1-44cd-a520-101f1af38c22","rating":5},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":3}],"photos":{"default":{"crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/9a519177b789c4c95c7b5142010454248239883d.jpg","MobileHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/a37ed0ac0e2502a7f87201575c5ceaf30cf9bd4a.jpg"},"licenseName":"UNLICENSED"},"mapbox_header":{"crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-77.788625,42.255866,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-77.788625,42.255866,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"UNLICENSED"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.3238636363636362,"count":528},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Alfred, NY"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/alfred-university/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"ac0d9f4c-e95d-41b4-8477-e27385d1ef44","badge":{"display":"Best Colleges in America","ordinal":847,"total":1644,"vanityURL":"best-colleges"},"content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"Trine University","type":"College","url":"trine-university"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.7671},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":25180},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"940-1200"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Sophomore","body":"This past year at Trine University I have become very close to all the people I have met.

Public Safety constantly picks up any fallen tree branches, shovels snow, and checks buildings to keep the campus safe. Annville is a small quiet town and the elderly are not afraid to call the police if the parties get too rowdy.  The campus food is not the best, but there is always a salad bar and deli.

It keeps you in line where as other schools you don't have that type of guidance where someone is always helping you. Another thing I like is that the regiment is very student based so they understand the struggles of the regiment program as well as the work load of the school.

They contact you within a short period of time to welcome you into the prospective Trojan family. I was invited to tour the campus as soon as I could, at my convenience. My Admissions Representative was extremely nice and informative. Every question or concern was answered. I was highly concerned over what UMO could offer me financially due to having a family that cannot easily support me. The Admissions Representative promised to try to get as much help for me as possible so I would be able to attend. Within a week of applying, I was accepted with a financial package! I toured the campus and it was absolutely beautiful! I would recommend this University to anyone interested in a private school with a beautiful campus and amazing staff!","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2018-05-25T03:58:07.250032Z","guid":"f0aa34ac-564e-46ce-95a8-374b6d5ad251","rating":5},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":2.66}],"photos":{"default":{"crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/a09f6ad86f271889d919452e75451992f405aef7.jpg","MobileHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/948941e090a25905d06e74410a9df6dbc1a64d28.jpg"},"licenseName":"UNLICENSED"},"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-78.071265,35.206314,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-78.071265,35.206314,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.5337620578778135,"count":311},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Mount Olive, NC"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/university-of-mount-olive/#scatterplot"}}]}
