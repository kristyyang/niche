For a small school, after a semester I am still meeting people I've never seen before (maybe I'm just unobservant),  and it seems students still find themselves making new friends even senior year. It's very high school socially, perhaps because of size, but the cliques aren't as intimidating. \nI have enjoyed classes immensely, not that I've had so much experience with them yet. I would recommend contacting professors early and often– twice I have contacted professors with interest in a particular course and they have just enrolled me! This doesn't seem like a super frequent practice, but do all you can  to get on waitlists as soon as possible because enrolling in courses is surprisingly difficult. Introducing yourself in person to prospective professors goes a long way.

There are a lot of philanthropic opportunities, as well as many clubs that give leadership lessons in whatever the student desires. Because Georgia Tech is a world-class campus, the opportunities offered to the students are many and are also well-funded for those who do not have a lot of money themselves. Because of this, over half of the student body participates in a program of campus before they graduate, which will normally be things like an internship, co-op, or studying abroad. The professors at this institute are extremely knowledgable in what they teach and most make an effort to meet the student where they need in order to further their academic progress.

Overall, BYU is a great school academically and socially.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2018-02-26T20:59:11.668466Z","guid":"4bfad887-814a-4cbd-8e15-8f16a82d1b85","rating":4},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":4.33}],"photos":{"default":{"author":"victorbjorklund","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/876bded21cdb84307b8d9d0d577d1c911b4fd924.jpg","MobileHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/dde3bf295b4118e68166b5a6fa531e67e250d813.jpg","Thumbnail":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/9cf2902d5faa495838ea7902fa0fe202f9e9baf3"},"licenseName":"CC BY ","licenseUrl":"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/2.0/","sourceUrl":"https://www.flickr.com/photos/victorbjorklund/11342478446/"},"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-111.649281,40.250851,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-111.649281,40.250851,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.9596942321056288,"count":7195},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Provo, UT"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/brigham-young-university/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"bc90e2b6-e112-43ed-ac5c-3548829ea3dd","badge":{"display":"Best Colleges for Psychology in America","ordinal":82,"total":993,"vanityURL":"best-colleges-for-psychology"},"content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"University of Texas - Austin","type":"College","url":"university-of-texas---austin"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.4037},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":16010},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"1140-1410"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Junior","body":"In one sentence:there.is.something.for.everyone!

For instance, I am a double major in Government and International Relations and Global Studies and am continuously amazed at the amount of programs, events, lectures , courses, and books available just for students in those majors. Your college's department of Career Services will blow you away as well, they will provide any and all resources to ensure your success after graduation.

Thanks to Oxy, I was able to get connected to many great opportunities such as study abroad, and now I am a Fulbright grantee.

And if you venture to the reading room you will be in for a treat for this room is none other than the Hogwarts dining hall!","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2018-01-27T20:34:11.594243Z","guid":"29de464c-700f-40a0-bde3-d920c56ac714","rating":5},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":4.33}],"photos":{"default":{"author":"jepoirrier","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/45e7bca3427caf2820c25bf15029341f8c448028.jpg","MobileHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/24f98ad777a2dffd6c49621b3ff1d45a86f3ae5f.jpg","Thumbnail":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/563917ac5c71d15dfb7eb9c0135a8d9e9926b7ba"},"licenseName":"CC BY-SA","licenseUrl":"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/","sourceUrl":"https://www.flickr.com/photos/jepoirrier/4736478333/"},"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-122.313115,47.656213,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-122.313115,47.656213,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.7020304568527918,"count":3940},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Seattle, WA"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/university-of-washington/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"d33fe5ed-526e-42c7-9f5f-9c58eed4a024","badge":{"display":"Best Colleges for Psychology in America","ordinal":96,"total":993,"vanityURL":"best-colleges-for-psychology"},"content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":true,"isPremium":true,"name":"Whitman College","type":"College","url":"whitman-college"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.5108},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":34272},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"1200-1420"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Alum","body":"You can do everything at Whitman- academics, leadership, hobbies.

Astrophysics is a growing field here and there are plenty of research opportunities here. However, it is one of the smaller programs on campus. Even so, you will find plenty of other astrophysics students to hang out with and the professors are great. Dr. Trainor is an awesome professor to have, but there are a lot of other great physics professors as well. \nThe music program is incredible. The faculty are all friendly people who you quickly come to trust. There is a great diversity in music ensembles, but it is a small school, so you get all of the drawbacks of that. All instruments are represented and you won't feel extreme pressure like you would for smaller ensembles.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2018-04-24T20:17:50.936072Z","guid":"0054fe78-eecc-424e-8e10-10103c75dbc3","rating":4},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":4.33}],"photos":{"default":{"crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/cfba010af8f7961d2fa9d333907e9304995d5826.jpg","MobileHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/0556c30bb788fe8071c3cda4085f7416d2f83393.jpg","Thumbnail":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/62d957295f2e31a47657e17bf6d88864e5b215cf"},"licenseName":"UNLICENSED"},"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-76.319037,40.048045,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-76.319037,40.048045,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.6297709923664123,"count":786},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Lancaster, PA"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/franklin--and--marshall-college/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"2c12263a-b1ae-46ce-9dc4-d666a58ffe12","badge":{"display":"Best Colleges for Psychology in America","ordinal":98,"total":993,"vanityURL":"best-colleges-for-psychology"},"content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":true,"isPremium":false,"name":"University of Pittsburgh","type":"College","url":"university-of-pittsburgh"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.5541},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":23572},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"1190-1380"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Junior","body":"If I could describe the Univeristy of Pittsburgh in one world, it would be home. Despite all of its flaws and imperfections, it is a safe space where I can explore and learn. The campus itself is a small city with features that make it feel more cozy than full-out sophisticated. From our beautiful Cathedral of Learning (we lovingly call her Cathy) to the spacious Schenley Park, there are tons of secret nooks that are perfect for studying. The professors, while teaching multiple classes, still make themselves available for questions outside the classroom. They are never too busy to stop and chat if you see them around campus; they really care about your education and that you have a passion for what you are studying. Overall, Pitt is an amazing college to attend. The community surrounding the campus challenge you and support you all at once.
