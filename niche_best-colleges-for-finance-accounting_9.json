This school opens you up to making connections in material and in the real world. I went straight to NYC for a decade, two weeks after graduating from SMC.

The amount of resources offered here at TXST are helpful, there is always help around every corner! My favorite part about being a bobcat is the energy associated walking through TXST’s campus, someone is always giving out free food (always accept free food in college), people play music, programs are out in the Quad doing activities at times and the overall feeling from being a student here at Texas State is powerful. If I could restart from my freshman year, I wouldn’t change a thing. Becoming a bobcat at Texas State University was the best decision I’ve ever made, and I am grateful for my high level of education.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2018-02-01T02:28:09.441055Z","guid":"095031b9-5176-4791-a118-c0282146277c","rating":5},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":3.33}],"photos":{"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-97.936392,29.889202,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-97.936392,29.889202,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.7317608337904553,"count":5469},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"San Marcos, TX"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/texas-state-university/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"88959d7a-13e8-4fba-be19-a0c9c7976a9a","badge":{"display":"Best Colleges for Accounting and Finance in America","ordinal":215,"total":652,"vanityURL":"best-colleges-for-accounting"},"content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"University of Wyoming","type":"College","url":"university-of-wyoming"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.9508},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":13155},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"960-1210"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Sophomore","body":"I love the classes for my major offered by the University.

Other than that, I have really enjoyed my time in Duluth and have no intentions of transferring.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2018-04-11T04:14:33.452193Z","guid":"f121b6d4-0275-4c75-869a-b5b81daa5019","rating":4},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":3.33}],"photos":{"default":{"crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/1e562a903f6491646584ae64c62ffcdeb6369c36.jpg","MobileHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/a6b0bb6911c55497268733970b537b4a54edb4e2.jpg"},"licenseName":"UNLICENSED"},"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-92.0866,46.817,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-92.0866,46.817,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.5698602794411176,"count":1002},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Duluth, MN"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/university-of-minnesota-duluth/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"c8ff6f6a-a5f0-4595-83e4-21d52fd11fc9","badge":{"display":"Best Colleges for Accounting and Finance in America","ordinal":222,"total":652,"vanityURL":"best-colleges-for-accounting"},"content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"Dallas Baptist University","type":"College","url":"dallas-baptist-university"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.4311},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":24669},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"1030-1190"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Niche User","body":"My Experience with Dallas Baptist so far has been exceptional, I am going to attend the University in the fall to study and play soccer and I'm super excited!

The food options on campus and around the town of Boone are amazing. Most things are locally grown and harvested, with plenty of Vegan/Vegetarian and gluten free/allergy free options. The atmosphere on campus and through out the whole community is one of adventure and excitement. The students really enjoy getting outside and getting active. The Blue Ridge Parkway has some of the best views in the United States, but I may be a little biased!

And that is very important in College!","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2018-02-09T21:44:19.239491Z","guid":"c182534e-0173-4e69-a281-8d54c921c721","rating":5},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":3.33}],"photos":{"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-81.782201,32.427756,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-81.782201,32.427756,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.7481622651783284,"count":3673},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Statesboro, GA"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/georgia-southern-university/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"92ded8f5-3578-4007-865a-8ec2bb1b36ff","badge":{"display":"Best Colleges for Accounting and Finance in America","ordinal":231,"total":652,"vanityURL":"best-colleges-for-accounting"},"content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"Ramapo College of New Jersey","type":"College","url":"ramapo-college-of-new-jersey"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.5326},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":15681},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"970-1190"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Sophomore","body":"I've had an excellent experience at Ramapo thus far. It's really easy to become very involved in the campus life, both as a commuter and as a resident. I've had good experiences with all of the staff in a variety of offices on campus. The College has also given me lots of opportunity, in terms of research, working on campus, and interacting with peers. In addition, I love the campus itself. We're located in the valley of the Ramapo mountains, with the Reservation right down the road. In the spring and fall particularly, the campus looks absolutely beautiful.

Awesome organizations on campus with lots of community service opportunities. Particular major is carefully designed to teach applicable skills helpful in the workforce/career path. On-campus facilities are well-kept and resourceful. The building architecture is absolutely stunning! Would like to see more scholarship opportunities for minority students. Federal Work-Study could offer more financial help, as the university is a private institution. Also more funding for the Theatre and Dance department. Would love to see study abroad programs from art and dance students to study artistic subjects across the globe.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2018-01-13T00:58:05.114193Z","guid":"33868434-e5cb-4e30-bfd7-dc5d25decb47","rating":4},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":3}],"photos":{"default":{"crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/693510118bec624b368a2d5f64715213b985bd6e.jpg","MobileHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/92de6ad116bfd77e78d6f29c01c6a7e9e2466e96.jpg"},"licenseName":"UNLICENSED"},"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-82.465582,27.947225,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-82.465582,27.947225,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.5673724735322425,"count":2078},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Tampa, FL"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/university-of-tampa/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"4662e8d2-30af-481f-b32d-bde25f1108f8","badge":{"display":"Best Colleges for Accounting and Finance in America","ordinal":234,"total":652,"vanityURL":"best-colleges-for-accounting"},"content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":true,"isPremium":false,"name":"University of Texas - Arlington","type":"College","url":"university-of-texas---arlington"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.6982},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":11952},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"950-1190"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Sophomore","body":"I am a single mother of 2 girls (9&7) and I am finally finishing my degree in want I want to do.

There are high praises for the teaching program at UTA Arlington. \nI am truly impressed with the way the professors are really there to help you out. And if you cannot make their office hours they accommodate you with a different time so they can assist you. \nI am very impressed with the math program at UTA Arlington.
