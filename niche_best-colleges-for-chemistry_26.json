It is a beautiful school on a gorgeous mountain in rural Emmitsburg, MD. The small student to professor ratio gives each student the opportunity to personally get to know each professor and to build a professional, but personal relationship with each faculty and staff member. The other students and members of the Mount community including coaches, priests, seminarians, and alumni are very involved in the school and try to make the students feel a part of a larger community. I have enjoyed each moment at the Mount because it has become my home away from home! Seriously, I call it home even when I am away from it! If I had to go through the college selection process again, I would still choose the Mount. Even though it is an older school in a country area, the people have made my three years at the Mount feel like I am in the city on a new campus. The community definitely sets the Mount apart from the many schools I toured. I am Mount Proud!","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2017-11-30T03:54:50.244818Z","guid":"193f1d97-425f-46b3-9214-546772734555","rating":4},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":3}],"photos":{"default":{"crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/1d235b5d3cb2c026d54cf772b47c1d0a256e819e.jpg","MobileHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/70ff7048caf78c2787aa2db4e7c5a6b7fd5a9d73.jpg"},"licenseName":"UNLICENSED"},"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-77.35222,39.680632,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-77.35222,39.680632,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.4057142857142857,"count":700},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Emmitsburg, MD"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/mount-st-marys-university/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"41604e44-acc1-4748-ad2d-a20c98aaa7da","content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"Oakwood University","type":"College","url":"oakwood-university"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.4837},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":26427},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"750-1010"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Junior","body":"I am a junior at Oakwood University in Huntsville, AL and I love being there!

Other than that, I have enjoyed being a student here and being a part of this community very much.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2018-01-10T19:34:35.293381Z","guid":"cf4b04f6-8efc-4646-a21f-5ed689c85cfb","rating":5},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":3.33}],"photos":{"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-84.289332,37.573334,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-84.289332,37.573334,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.2128146453089244,"count":437},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Berea, KY"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/berea-college/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"bd08d6d0-56d9-427e-9b27-40d6a06c017f","content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":true,"isPremium":true,"name":"Meredith College","type":"College","url":"meredith-college"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.6079},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":25597},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"920-1123"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Freshman","body":"Their welcoming environment and supportive community is perfect for helping me grow and flourish as an artist, honing and perfecting my skills to the highest possible quality.

There is a strong Physical Therapy Program here and many Biology Majors. The math program is also very strong. The campus is small but growing. Lebanon Valley College is a predominately white campus, although there is a strong support system for diverse students. Not all dorms have an air conditioning unit. Public Safety constantly picks up any fallen tree branches, shovels snow, and checks buildings to keep the campus safe. Annville is a small quiet town and the elderly are not afraid to call the police if the parties get too rowdy.  The campus food is not the best, but there is always a salad bar and deli. Turkey Hill also supplies the ice cream. Overall, Student Life is wonderful because of the small campus atmosphere, residential life, and strong support systems.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2017-11-26T05:10:44.135345Z","guid":"f35b0c23-89fa-4f0f-b3f4-cd46eaa73996","rating":4},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":3}],"photos":{"default":{"crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/b1f4e61e020e6c6fcb285452b90a38c2ece628af.jpg","MobileHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/f493c8c7ff60bde0b46f8125d88154472161e700.jpg"},"licenseName":"UNLICENSED"},"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-76.513753,40.331733,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-76.513753,40.331733,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.535372848948375,"count":523},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Annville, PA"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/lebanon-valley-college/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"88e9031e-f7e1-42f5-9d9e-d109c05c33f8","content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":true,"isPremium":true,"name":"St. Bonaventure University","type":"College","url":"st-bonaventure-university"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.659},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":23336},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"930-1163"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Freshman","body":"Overall, the college is great! It is centered around family and Franciscan values that more people should live by. People are USUALLY friendly. \nDOWNSIDES that I notice are the occasional talk about drinking and partying. If you are a student that does not party or drink, then you might feel uncomfortable and may find it hard to relate to these peers but if you are able to focus on yourself and don't give in to peer pressure, you should be fine and l. There are soo many clubs you can take part in such as the Laugh Pack, plays, sports, Mountain Community Leaders, and much more. The campus is big on Sustainability and Environmental education. Another Downside I notice is that if you are an environmental Science major, there is only one professor that teaches most of the related and required courses that you need to take so if you don't like that professor, you are stuck with him.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2018-01-22T02:09:46.788381Z","guid":"6a5ba709-3575-4ef7-ab39-067c7e19cb81","rating":5},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":3.33}],"photos":{"default":{"crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/4f10633795264bc68f217d2de4b877d0c97220eb.jpg","MobileHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/6cbb0c14d5d6a79b61567239e67ecef009fecc9f.jpg"},"licenseName":"UNLICENSED"},"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-78.47586,42.07863,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-78.47586,42.07863,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.560493827160494,"count":405},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Saint Bonaventure, NY"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/st-bonaventure-university/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"d433946b-5d26-4d5b-94f7-43e28e779f2a","content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"Saint Vincent College - Pennsylvania","type":"College","url":"saint-vincent-college---pennsylvania"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.6587},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":22903},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"940-1160"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Freshman","body":"Saint Vincent College is described as a close-knit and rural college founded on Benedictine Tradition.  Not as corny as it sounds.  You know people in major/outside.  News flow isn't always the best. If you bond with teachers and professors easily, you will always have the upper hand.  Professors care and work with you.  Many repeatedly encourage students to visit offices.  Very open. Running trail by cornfields,  wetlands to explore, two lakes, a cemetery, woods, and school is only 2-10 minutes from Walmart/The Mall/etc (Many job opps aside from work study).  Mass held in the basilica on Sunday. Professors are also VERY FRIENDLY monks that live on campus.  Don't feel pressured if not religious, no requirements.\n\nMiscellaneous:\nAthletics huge here.  Will pass several official/intramural teams daily.\nTuition reduced a lot.  Listed price is falsely high.\nSafe.  Quiet/calm weekends.\nHousing OKAY.  Really depends.\nGood food.  Can be repetitive though.

I have just grown so much here and been forced to think in ways that are much different than the ways high school necessitated from me. I discovered that I am actually more of an extrovert and less of an introvert; This epiphany dawned upon me after the realization that I could, at Swarthmore, engage in deep and lengthy conversations with other students. While individual achievement was emphasized at my High School, I've managed to develop new networking skills with the principle of never working alone and achieving together. Another thing that stands out about my experience at Swarthmore is that I haven't had the chance yet to operate once again under a cynical mindset, everybody is so nice here.

The dorms are small, but they are functional for the needs of a college student. The town has many opportunities for apartments that get rented to SFU students.

Also, Lake Forest does an excellent job of fostering student leaders through a variety of clubs and programs on and off campus.

Whether your passion is in athletics, student government, theatre or anything else on our long list of available opportunities you will find a home at WAC. \n\nOn the side of academics the professors are the ones who deserve so much credit. They will go out of their way to ensure that your are living up to your true potential. With class sizes of about 16-17 students it's hard to hide in the corner or skip class without your professor noticing. Trust me, this is a good thing. If you get the chance to visit campus be sure to swing your department of interest and talk to any of the professors there! Washington College is truly a special place.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2017-06-07T16:00:43.370725Z","guid":"7500bc75-4c9d-469c-b69f-3abc3459fb35","rating":5},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":3.33}],"photos":{"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-76.06878,39.217329,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-76.06878,39.217329,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.5479876160990713,"count":646},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Chestertown, MD"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/washington-college/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"6138c67c-08c1-45b8-afc2-d3763d2cc358","content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"Edgewood College","type":"College","url":"edgewood-college"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.7587},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":24111},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"955-1078"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Freshman","body":"My experience with Edgewood College so far, has been wonderful.

They contact you within a short period of time to welcome you into the prospective Trojan family. I was invited to tour the campus as soon as I could, at my convenience. My Admissions Representative was extremely nice and informative. Every question or concern was answered. I was highly concerned over what UMO could offer me financially due to having a family that cannot easily support me. The Admissions Representative promised to try to get as much help for me as possible so I would be able to attend. Within a week of applying, I was accepted with a financial package! I toured the campus and it was absolutely beautiful! I would recommend this University to anyone interested in a private school with a beautiful campus and amazing staff!","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2018-05-25T03:58:07.250032Z","guid":"f0aa34ac-564e-46ce-95a8-374b6d5ad251","rating":5},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":2.66}],"photos":{"default":{"crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/a09f6ad86f271889d919452e75451992f405aef7.jpg","MobileHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/948941e090a25905d06e74410a9df6dbc1a64d28.jpg"},"licenseName":"UNLICENSED"},"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-78.071265,35.206314,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-78.071265,35.206314,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.5337620578778135,"count":311},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Mount Olive, NC"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/university-of-mount-olive/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"181d4597-8efb-4816-a3dd-ae9f78ddb734","content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":true,"isPremium":false,"name":"Hillsdale College","type":"College","url":"hillsdale-college"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.45},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":20817},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"1190-1440"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Freshman","body":"I have attended Hillsdale for almost a year now, and it has been great! The professors sincerely care about the students' education and are always there for them. Since it is a small college, the community is tightly-knit; students can hardly walk across campus without saying hello to at least one person, students have movie nights and mixers together, and sometimes will even be invited to dine at professors' houses. Hillsdale is academically challenging, which creates an excellence that allows students to self-govern, and discover how to think.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2017-04-26T21:22:41.395562Z","guid":"4413aa3a-4f1a-43e4-8004-fdb285a665cd","rating":4},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":3.33}],"photos":{"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-84.62,41.89,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-84.62,41.89,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.679640718562874,"count":334},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Hillsdale, MI"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/hillsdale-college/#scatterplot"}}]}
