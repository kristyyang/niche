IU is a small, Catholic University, where we have a small student body, but one big family. There are so many opportunities given to each and every student at IU, but it is up to the students to really take advantage of them. I have been involved in so much and have gotten to connect with faculty and get to learn more and more about IU. We have a developed Campus life that gets all of the students engaged and out doing something fun. The advantage of a smaller university like Immaculata is that if you cannot find something here that you like or want to be involved in, you can create it and create a long lasting legacy at Immaculata.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2017-08-05T22:47:38.769621Z","guid":"7d638fb6-a766-4cd0-82f2-c9b6d92db942","rating":5},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":2.33}],"photos":{"default":{"crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/8b8a50b2482326200bb64551dbe583fa77366d7d.jpg","MobileHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/815667c724edcbe2b8923ef3d221a5eac8d8181e.jpg"},"licenseName":"UNLICENSED"},"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-75.57063,40.027963,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-75.57063,40.027963,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.5078740157480315,"count":254},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Immaculata, PA"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/immaculata-university/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"e5da6025-115b-44b1-aa7a-01ed4f30fad5","content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":true,"isPremium":false,"name":"Southern Wesleyan University","type":"College","url":"southern-wesleyan-university"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.5502},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":14914},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"810-1050"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Niche User","body":"I like Southern Wesleyan University because the Faculty, Staff, and Students put God first.

There are a wide variety of groups, sports and activities to become involved in at this school. The University of Charleston really focuses on making each student feel comfortable expressing his or her self while continuing their education. However, like any other University, each students' experience is what he or she makes out of it.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2017-05-23T15:27:28.810664Z","guid":"7b5fa0d7-d97b-4e6e-be88-ea213efb227f","rating":4},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":2.66}],"photos":{"default":{"crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/8d03e1d992b21320639dd5d92627502e6781c2e5.jpg","MobileHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/a724f93ef4449bea76618611327b5d6c19d23760.jpg"},"licenseName":"UNLICENSED"},"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-81.618667,38.332577,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-81.618667,38.332577,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.2524752475247527,"count":202},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Charleston, WV"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/university-of-charleston/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"fe32180b-4d90-4e2b-9b5c-1f03afe9ce0d","content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"Concordia College - New York","type":"College","url":"concordia-college---new-york"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.7105},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":20327},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"830-1010"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Junior","body":"My experience at Concordia college has been nothing short of exceptional.

However, if there are two aspects that I would like to see CSULA improve on, they would be the local area and campus food. I would appreciate it if there were interesting activities to participate in in the local area and if there was a much bigger variety of healthy food choices aside from the food trucks and the food court.

I was very impressed during the summer science program I attended in 2017.  My greatest accomplishment was my ability to be the student during the summer science program to receive the overall student achievement. Not only was I surprised, I was absolutely elated. I value the academic challenge Toygaloo offers.  Tougaloo is a private historic kept secret and many people are not aware of the opportunity that this great HBC can offer.  The alumni association is also very encouraging and supportive in more ways than one, but I also have to say the campus can use a more modern updated look.  Tougaloo has been around a long time and mostly all funds come from private donors, with that in mind I understand that the funds are used for people like me to be funded for college books, housing and etc and that can be very costly.

I selected this school because (a) I grew up in Christian Science and like the religion, and (b) I am NOT into partying. At all. Some people party here (quietly), but most do not. I'm currently a Sophomore and love it here. I play on the soccer team and have two different jobs, and keep very busy. I didn't think I'd attend a college with only 500 students, since my high school had 1200 students, but I feel very comfortable here. Sometimes it gets  super-quiet here on weekends, but I've always been able to find someone to hang out with.

The faculty cares so much about every student, regardless of any differences they may have. Student involvement is high and there is much fun to be had! This is one of the few colleges that I know of where your professors invite you for dinner and you have their personal cell phone numbers. Their care and compassion for every student is incredible. \nThe facilities are being updated, thanks to our new CIU President. The campus is beautiful and somewhat secluded from the city, with many walking trails all around the campus.
