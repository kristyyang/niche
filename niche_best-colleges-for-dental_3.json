All of the professors I've had so far except one, are very helpful, and you are able to establish a more personal relationship with your professors due to the small class sizes. All of your professors will know your name, and they really care about helping you individually, how you are doing, and care about making sure you succeed, especially in SIS (department of International Studies). Another pro is that since its a small school, everybody knows everybody for the most part, and everybody is very friendly. For this reason, its also easy to make and find friends, and you'll see the usual students you see around the usual times you see them when you go to the cafeteria, the lair, the gym, or the library.\nThe Freshmen dorms, the walls are VERY thin, you literally could hear everything so it could get annoying if your floor or neighbors are loud and you want to sleep, study, or just want some peace and quiet.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2018-06-02T18:05:05.687909Z","guid":"2b702cec-ed70-418f-b294-d8d325c942f7","rating":4},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":3.66}],"photos":{"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-121.307296,37.980624,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-121.307296,37.980624,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.5813544415127527,"count":1137},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Stockton, CA"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/university-of-the-pacific/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"8c822904-1fbe-4b33-933f-ab6d331b4df3","content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"University of Alaska Fairbanks","type":"College","url":"university-of-alaska-fairbanks"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.7347},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":9097},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"950-1200"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Senior","body":"This school excels at the sciences, though most people don't believe the math department is up to par.

The staff are amazing; they'll invite you over to eat and talk and are always available if you have quesions. The campus itself is sort of tucked away in its own little community and has a nice feel to it. If you like the outdoors it's even better because of the 35+ miles of biking and hiking trails. There are several restaurants on campus that are worked by the students and have a wide variety of food choices. Finally, the spiritual side of Southern is beautiful. Everyone is so welcoming and always has your back. It's a big, beautiful family.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2018-05-10T17:12:58.005846Z","guid":"1f753bc3-d28a-40e8-bce2-e92cdb7accdf","rating":5},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":3}],"photos":{"default":{"crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/45cb79fe27fa02739f7ca4eb22b3a721c9ca4a45.jpg","MobileHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/d335a4b8bf95efce71fa4e813b48d3699ded5bc4.jpg"},"licenseName":"UNLICENSED"},"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-85.050878,35.049136,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-85.050878,35.049136,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.577524893314367,"count":703},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Collegedale, TN"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/southern-adventist-university/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"d41d7e06-7206-40e7-8c24-b52c3d29a39f","content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"Siena Heights University","type":"College","url":"siena-heights-university"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.7172},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":17519},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"880-1050"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Freshman","body":"As a Freshman (Sophmore as of Fall 2018) I commute from my house. While i dont live on campus, there are many activities and events that you can attend, as well as organizations. I love Siena, as i am double majoring in Early Education and Child Development. As a double major, communicating with the teachers and advisors is a key part to it. Overall, I feel that Siena is the best choice for me, and have had great experiences with all teachers. While on campus, many of the staff members will get to know you by name, not as a number. To me, it is really important to recognize students and call them by name, as it makes you feel important. There is always a Campus Safety Guard around for emergencies, and they are very quick responders. The campus is well diverse, but all students are welcoming and accepting of each other.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2018-04-27T01:09:36.640892Z","guid":"f5eb111c-ee6c-47f4-b1bf-ef96ce0c7c89","rating":4},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":2.66}],"photos":{"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-84.015144,41.905952,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-84.015144,41.905952,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.4545454545454546,"count":440},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Adrian, MI"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/siena-heights-university/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"c50ffbc2-4ad1-4ecb-bc70-2dd97515a21b","badge":{"display":"Best Colleges in America","ordinal":436,"total":1644,"vanityURL":"best-colleges"},"content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"Vermont Technical College","type":"College","url":"vermont-technical-college"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.879},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":19117},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"840-1050"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Niche User","body":"I have heard nothing, but wonderful comments on Vermont Technical College.
