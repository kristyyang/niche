If you're looking for a college that'll ensure you get your basics done and career into Engineering/Nursing, then this school is the one! The people I've met at UTRGV aren't the best individuals, but the ones that stick around in your life are the real treasure here. The culture here is very friendly and despite me working part-time here, all my 'customers' are nice and friendly and very patient with New comers! The teachers you meet show that they actually put genuine thought and belief into the subject that they teach, unlike most Highschools you recently get out of. The people you meet with when assigned for groups actually care about their grade, so I doubt you'll find much slackers trying to sink the group down by not contributing. It's a small college though, but I'm okay with it!","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2017-11-13T20:47:08.203495Z","guid":"7c15031e-64ae-4195-9d22-8447c482eb4f","rating":4},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":3}],"photos":{"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-98.172112,26.306629,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-98.172112,26.306629,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.6126924871675223,"count":2143},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Edinburg, TX"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/university-of-texas---rio-grande-valley/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"f1d14db3-7297-4753-b76f-7ad0b42bec55","content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"Utah State University","type":"College","url":"utah-state-university"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.9025},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":13037},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"980-1220"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Junior","body":"I have thoroughly enjoyed my time at Utah State University.

There are many restaurants nearby. Also, there are bars and clubs nearby if you are interested in the night life! I am a freshman. So far, my instructors have taught well! A lot of work is required, but I'm sure that goes for any university. There are students of all ages. The parking is TERRIBLE. The school has purchased all parking anywhere near the school and parking permits are needed everywhere. I tried to buy a parking permit but there were no more available. So I was forced to walk a mile to classes, and even still had to pay at parking meters. I didn't mind the walk, but sometimes could not find parking. Another thing I didn't appreciate is that there are no places where I could pump my breast milk, since I am a breastfeeding momma. I always had to pump in restrooms which seemed unsanitary and quite frankly stinky at times. My adviser has been great! She is very helpful.

As with any college, it has its share of issues--parking is a big one--sometimes you will hear uncomfortable stories about the older dorms and every once an a while someone would get something gross at the dining hall but these few slips are to be expected anywhere.  As far as academics my classes are small, personal, and most of my teachers are beyond great.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2018-04-02T21:55:59.407644Z","guid":"82779b0d-b2cc-4f6b-bd37-94a1b428e898","rating":5},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":3}],"photos":{"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-85.950191,31.800128,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-85.950191,31.800128,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.6317626527050613,"count":1719},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Troy, AL"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/troy-university/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"04b96d74-4243-448d-b842-0c4e6a1dfe97","content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"California State University - Dominguez Hills","type":"College","url":"california-state-university---dominguez-hills"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.4791},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":3297},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"760-940"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Senior","body":"Dominguez Hills has paved the road for my physical therapy career.

Weekends are very quiet and there aren't a lot of parties going on mostly because of the lack of students on campus. But, there is some change happening!

You must take a bus to your car.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2017-02-08T03:59:08.500625Z","guid":"22223015-ba2e-4f1a-b996-3c50f91dbfb5","rating":4},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":2.66}],"photos":{"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-83.289925,30.849236,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-83.289925,30.849236,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.5606904231625833,"count":1796},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Valdosta, GA"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/valdosta-state-university/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"01a78443-7ab0-4bd6-8ca6-7398458c4684","content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"California State University - Bakersfield","type":"College","url":"california-state-university---bakersfield"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.6782},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":6143},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"790-1020"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Alum","body":"I love CSUB. I think it is such an underrated university, and it is so beautiful and green. The faculty in my department were always so encouraging and helpful, not to mention, intelligent and incredibly knowledgeable about their academic discipline. The facilities are not what you would perhaps find in other more prestigious universities, and I wish CSUB had postgraduate studies available, but as a Bakersfield native, I saved a lot of money going here! I feel very confident about the education I received and I feel great about my degree.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2018-06-05T10:36:19.506265Z","guid":"816d9167-f366-4ede-a82b-b564b511635a","rating":4},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":2.66}],"photos":{"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-119.104711,35.350005,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-119.104711,35.350005,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.491609081934847,"count":1013},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Bakersfield, CA"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/california-state-university---bakersfield/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"dc2b083e-e598-4f67-ac9b-111a94edac06","content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"Austin Peay State University","type":"College","url":"austin-peay-state-university"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.8886},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":12688},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"933-1124"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Sophomore","body":"Austin Peay State University has given me the best experience in college. The campus is beautiful and provides so many opportunities for every student. My first semester at Austin Peay, I was so involved on campus that I was there every day of every week. I got involved at the Foy Fitness Center in an aerial silks class. I really appreciated that the two instructors were involved with each student and pushed each of us to the best of our abilities. I also got accepted into Sigma Kappa, the new sorority on campus. Being in Sigma Kappa was the one of the best things that had ever happened to me. It formed me into a social butterfly and allowed me to really help out in the community. The women of Sigma Kappa came together to host events with other sororities to bring people together for charity. Being at APSU has transformed my life in the most amazing ways. I will always cherish the memories I have and the memories I will continue to make while attending at Austin Peay. Go Govs!","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2018-05-15T23:06:48.651412Z","guid":"25616d7b-1f87-4978-8b4f-917489ccfc62","rating":5},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":2.66}],"photos":{"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-87.354081,36.533319,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-87.354081,36.533319,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.5682747342600165,"count":1223},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Clarksville, TN"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/austin-peay-state-university/#scatterplot"}}]}
