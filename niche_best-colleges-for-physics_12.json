Your meal plan includes money for other food not just the dining hall. You have on and off campus options. On campus includes moes, chic Fa la and which wich but of course you'll get tired of that or just feel fancy and wanna go out. The school card (one card) includes off campus restaurants as well! They provide you with a list but it's expected to grow. They do not provide close enough student parking though. You must take a bus to your car.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2017-02-08T03:59:08.500625Z","guid":"22223015-ba2e-4f1a-b996-3c50f91dbfb5","rating":4},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":2.66}],"photos":{"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-83.289925,30.849236,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-83.289925,30.849236,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.5606904231625833,"count":1796},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Valdosta, GA"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/valdosta-state-university/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"9066192d-2875-4e79-9fd9-1b25e3bc1601","content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"Slippery Rock University","type":"College","url":"slippery-rock-university"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.6949},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":17443},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"910-1090"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Junior","body":"I like being offered the opportunity to expand my horizons at Slippery Rock University.

Class sizes are normally small enough that professors can talk to and interact with students on a one-on-one basis to answer questions, to provide assistance, to facilitate conversation, and to even assist with opportunities. With more than seventy individual majors and the opportunities to earn multiple majors, students definitely have not only variety but choice to maximize the opportunities afforded to them to achieve their dreams. The Office of Undergraduate Research has been instrumental in allowing students to travel, to present research, and network, and students are often more than prepared to attend graduate schools and to fill the vacant job and/or leadership positions available after college.

Because social -- and often intellectual -- life centers around student organizations, I've had the chance to meet people who share my passions. In lieu of Greek life, student organizations host parties that foster a sense of community that centers around something deeper than hazing or a few Greek letters. The professors are caring and encourage you to think for yourself. Another thing I want to emphasize is the effect of Jesuit values. I was hesitant about them coming in because I'm not religious, but Georgetown doesn't shove religion down your throat. Rather, the school makes a concerted and largely successful effort to instill Jesuit values into all aspects of the community, such as the values of empathy, care, and intellectual risk-taking.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2018-05-30T01:34:22.337211Z","guid":"978b0f5f-2601-433d-8a81-599a051a623f","rating":5},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":4.33}],"photos":{"default":{"author":"bootbearwdc","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/12abac16c83fda20334b5c577c5b4ec014e75704.jpg","MobileHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/120f5736f8423c08516a76bf1a3fd36cc3ebf457.jpg","Thumbnail":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/47a9f5b83376225e5d4b4f612ef47b38724d2850"},"licenseName":"CC BY ","licenseUrl":"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/2.0/","sourceUrl":"https://www.flickr.com/photos/bootbearwdc/57647301/"},"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-77.073463,38.908809,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-77.073463,38.908809,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.7115559599636034,"count":1099},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Washington, DC"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/georgetown-university/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"dc2b083e-e598-4f67-ac9b-111a94edac06","content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"Austin Peay State University","type":"College","url":"austin-peay-state-university"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.8886},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":12688},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"933-1124"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Sophomore","body":"Austin Peay State University has given me the best experience in college. The campus is beautiful and provides so many opportunities for every student. My first semester at Austin Peay, I was so involved on campus that I was there every day of every week. I got involved at the Foy Fitness Center in an aerial silks class. I really appreciated that the two instructors were involved with each student and pushed each of us to the best of our abilities. I also got accepted into Sigma Kappa, the new sorority on campus. Being in Sigma Kappa was the one of the best things that had ever happened to me. It formed me into a social butterfly and allowed me to really help out in the community. The women of Sigma Kappa came together to host events with other sororities to bring people together for charity. Being at APSU has transformed my life in the most amazing ways.

I truly have enjoyed my first semester here at Southern.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2018-01-16T17:33:25.891699Z","guid":"e86932eb-3ca3-479f-8341-2d1886daf303","rating":4},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":2.66}],"photos":{"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-72.948806,41.331852,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-72.948806,41.331852,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.4261224489795916,"count":1225},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"New Haven, CT"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/southern-connecticut-state-university/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"8a41db38-a2bb-4999-991b-cb37387781d7","content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":true,"isPremium":true,"name":"Vanderbilt University","type":"College","url":"vanderbilt-university"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.1075},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":23150},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"1420-1590"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Graduate Student","body":"I am admitted to the school of nursing in preparation mode for classes to begin.

SLU is an extremely open college where you will meet people from diverse backgrounds who have different experiences. Of course, people will always complain and say that the \"rich white people\" surround SLU. However, if you actually try and engage in the SLU community you will find more than just that. SLU has given me life long friends and an education that I am proud of. So far my classes have gone well and are usually well taught. If there are any complaints, there are always surveys at the end of the semester that go straight to the department heads for review. Finding the right college for you is difficult. I was lucky enough to fall in love with SLU as soon as I visited. I definitely suggest visiting and doing an overnight to see if SLU is right for you.

There's so many places to go to receive help, it's very reassuring especially when you're having a bad day. Next, the campus and the dorms are nice. The campus is very large which means a lot of walking, but it's not that bad because there's such beautiful architecture and landscaping to look at. The dorms are small and neat, but there's air conditioning which is a major plus. I got to sit through a real college class, which at Hofstra are relatively small. The food at Hofstra has a pretty good selection, but nothing crazy. There are Starbucks, Dunkin Donuts, Subways, Sbarros, and many other places to grab a bite to eat.

The frats are super fun and the sororities are very much tiered.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2018-04-27T15:05:15.241832Z","guid":"25a7df8c-325e-4f63-8a9c-ec29e931c4c2","rating":5},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":4.33}],"photos":{"default":{"author":"suecline","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/435bf9d98f6351f337a3c34fde2221d8ddbc14fa.jpg","MobileHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/257e8ee373f9dcbf1d9188ec2bc484bc68ec6d94.jpg","Thumbnail":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/4440b43e8b51e8bf4c6f400859b150b7192aa3e9"},"licenseName":"CC BY ","licenseUrl":"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/2.0/","sourceUrl":"https://www.flickr.com/photos/suecline/2354987089/"},"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-90.120409,29.939696,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-90.120409,29.939696,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.682288077188146,"count":1451},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"New Orleans, LA"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/tulane-university/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"72a41b41-aadc-45ea-bf78-592becb4f1b7","content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":true,"isPremium":true,"name":"University of San Francisco","type":"College","url":"university-of-san-francisco"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.7137},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":35054},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"1030-1250"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Junior","body":"So far in my time at the University of San Francisco, I have been blown away by the professors.

I have had my bad experiences with a professor or two but you can not avoid that no matter where you go. I love the residence halls! You have your own bedroom share a living room and bathroom with one other person and they heavily work with you if you want a particular roommate. Dining hall has its flaws for sure but they are taking steps in the right direction making their food fresher and tastier. Overall I have been happy with the classes and living conditions.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2017-12-28T20:44:48.117198Z","guid":"cafe1977-fb94-4580-a22a-d87d2a2a39ea","rating":4},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":2.66}],"photos":{"default":{"crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/c8b5aa43cd68a0d1ff28bf772f2b3dc255bf42af.jpg","MobileHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/280dfd75257fb4f70b3ecdc3682d69394bbb400e.jpg"},"licenseName":"UNLICENSED"},"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-94.073389,30.044274,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-94.073389,30.044274,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.464195450716091,"count":1187},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Beaumont, TX"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/lamar-university/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"8c7f93e4-7738-43ab-81e2-876c5fef63ce","content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"Loyola Marymount University","type":"College","url":"loyola-marymount-university"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.5387},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":40946},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"1120-1330"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Freshman","body":"This university campus is beautiful! I've stopped by here on and off throughout the years, and now I have had a chance to come here and I have many friends who came here. Notably, many of my buddies that play basketball. This school is private and tuition is high, yes, but the quality is great. The facilities are clean, modern, and pleasing to the eye. The students here are pretty cool too. If you're looking for a private school, and want more of a quiet suburban feel, then LMU might be your place.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2018-03-30T20:43:27.53187Z","guid":"4290c19c-2342-498d-a9aa-06552a88b019","rating":4},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":4}],"photos":{"default":{"author":"adangarcia","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/a38dca15400c33a551571deac73e2f1969890901.jpg","MobileHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/00a04b52e8930e528883d75cf7a194b035222d1c.jpg","Thumbnail":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/2ad218cbd1f66c682311e9ee5c77477fef195c01"},"licenseName":"CC BY ","licenseUrl":"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/2.0/","sourceUrl":"https://www.flickr.com/photos/adangarcia/2810418976/"},"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-118.415655,33.970633,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-118.415655,33.970633,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.6884389288047026,"count":1531},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Los Angeles, CA"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/loyola-marymount-university/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"3602fc0f-fca6-4a42-8e3d-2ae888e5927f","content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"Texas A&M University - Commerce","type":"College","url":"texas-a-and-m-university---commerce"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.4614},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":9032},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"870-1080"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Freshman","body":"Commerce is a great place to attend college! The campus is small, so you get more one on one time in class. This helped me to learn more and made me more confident around my classmates.

Everything I experienced in Commerce made me appreciate the small campus and I loved every moment.
