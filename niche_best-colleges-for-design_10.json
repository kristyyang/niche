Started in the dorms my freshman year and eventually moving off campus, everything is walkable (including downtown), there is a ton of nightlife, and the resources available to students is pretty phenomenal. Parking is awful - best to buy parking passes well in advance and don't expect to find anything if you're coming from off campus - but the nursing program is stellar and really competitive, as are most of the programs there. I highly recommend because of the size (big enough that you'll meet a lot of people, small enough that you'll feel known in your classes - most are 25-100 people) and the location and price - you can't beat the dorms!","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2017-12-27T23:49:16.69583Z","guid":"1e7538d9-136a-443f-8cea-36b24e593c75","rating":4},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":2.66}],"photos":{"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-85.299812,35.048247,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-85.299812,35.048247,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.556716417910448,"count":1340},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Chattanooga, TN"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/university-of-tennessee---chattanooga/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"b13ffea8-7ed5-4389-b870-029bb8559596","content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"University of North Dakota","type":"College","url":"university-of-north-dakota"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.8369},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":14693},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"960-1190"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Graduate Student","body":"I am in my last semester of the UND Special Ed online masters program before my internship and then graduation next semester.

I live on campus in Dixon Hall and it is extremely nice, the dorms are suite-style and the whole building is secure and airconditioned. My favorite part of the campus has to be the student recreation center. The fitness center is my absolute favorite place to go and it is packed with any machine that you could want. Also inside the rec center is an awesome rock wall, some courts, an indoor track and a smoothie bar! I spend most of my time here and I love having it just a walking distance away from my room.

It is a wonderful school with a beautiful camps and great professors. The class sizes are the perfect size, your professor actually get to know your name and they really care about your education. The student life at CMU is great there's never not an activity going on, and if you don't want to stay on campus there many activities just minutes away from the CMU. Weather you like hiking, mountain biking, skiing, paddle boarding you name it then CMU is the right choice for you. And even if you've never done any of those thing CMU has a wonderful Outdoors program that will take you on trips and teach you the basics. Outdoors activites not for you that's okay we have a great rec gym with racquetball courts, basketball courts, rock climbing wall and even a Olympic size swimming pool. So come check out CMU we'd love to have you join our Mavley.

Allowing them to have a car for the first year would only give them the opportunity to get to and from home and also to and from a variety of attractions and destinations here in Tallahassee.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2017-11-23T05:57:34.467389Z","guid":"feda6c36-a053-4c8d-99d5-a0469e89b639","rating":4},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":3.33}],"photos":{"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-84.285664,30.428599,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-84.285664,30.428599,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.474764756201882,"count":2338},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Tallahassee, FL"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/florida-a-and-m-university/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"dd79308c-7ca1-49de-ad76-6957be74628a","content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"CUNY Lehman College","type":"College","url":"cuny-lehman-college"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.3248},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":6159},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"910-1080"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Junior","body":"What i like most about Lehman is that there are always great opportunities to move ahead in academics. There are always professors, general staff and faculty that advertise and  support the struggling student. These supports are not limited to academics, but extends all the way to financial struggles as well. Lehman is a great campus, however, there are always improvements to be made. One of the improvements I wish to see in Cuny Lehman is the extension of campus space. There is so much diversity on campus and more buildings that gear toward integrating this diversity would be fantastic!","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2018-01-30T00:56:16.065564Z","guid":"09f9fb71-6b1c-4df2-b86f-8f579c5491ea","rating":4},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":3}],"photos":{"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-73.894627,40.873928,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-73.894627,40.873928,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.5506715506715505,"count":819},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Bronx, NY"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/cuny-lehman-college/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"a6fee292-a097-47f9-bd8e-783a24bb99c2","content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"Indiana University-Purdue University - Fort Wayne","type":"College","url":"indiana-university-purdue-university---fort-wayne"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.9326},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":7270},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"860-1080"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Freshman","body":"IPFW is a very welcoming campus.

However, the diversity presented within the school is quite low. There are sparse percentages of Latinos, Hispanics, African Americans, and Asians. Even though this is the case, the gradual enrollment of multiple international students does decrease the evident ethnic gap among students. Additonally, many of the teachers and remainder of the faculty are friendly and supportive for all students to succeed. With constant reminders regarding the A-LEC center and its workshops, students are free to ask questions from a variety of multiple disciplines to tutors who are readily available! Without a doubt, the student life at SMU is the best!","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2018-01-30T03:27:01.469662Z","guid":"380afcf0-e745-4fc5-9134-a817aa24b2d1","rating":4},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":4.33}],"photos":{"default":{"author":"euthman","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/742055c6f0c4f0bab3be94607c7be38bb0a402a6.jpg","MobileHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/19fb100c7a50cc341664339341226094735ae8b3.jpg","Thumbnail":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/cb4fbe35880f13c56ba84f5ff53630f027c9194e"},"licenseName":"CC BY-SA","licenseUrl":"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/","sourceUrl":"https://www.flickr.com/photos/euthman/2344932369/"},"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-96.784855,32.845254,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-96.784855,32.845254,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.8063354931605473,"count":1389},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Dallas, TX"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/southern-methodist-university/#scatterplot"}}]}
