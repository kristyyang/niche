The school has professors who love helping students do their best. Many students have interviews or jobs lined up right after graduation. Student organizations host activities on the weekends for breaks from work. Saint Francis University is a Division I college but is small so the athletics are good and entertaining to watch. The dorms are small, but they are functional for the needs of a college student. The town has many opportunities for apartments that get rented to SFU students. The campus rarely has incidents regarding the police. Campus Police makes regular rounds around campus to keep students safe.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2017-06-05T20:43:55.467264Z","guid":"d829face-ded0-4bb5-8287-217ca6c60392","rating":5},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":2.66}],"photos":{"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-78.638469,40.502782,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-78.638469,40.502782,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.513671875,"count":512},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Loretto, PA"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/saint-francis-university/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"8fcb41bc-0e1e-4b41-a10f-e18135592bfa","content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"University of Northern Iowa","type":"College","url":"university-of-northern-iowa"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.8256},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":14831},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"885-1220"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Alum","body":"The University of Northern Iowa is a great school to go to!

All races, ethnicities, and cultures are presented throughout the country, allowing us to share and experience from one another.Definitely, a perfect match for me and would not want to change a thing.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2018-02-02T00:20:25.186561Z","guid":"dc27a867-d32f-4fc7-80bb-6f5313bafebe","rating":5},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":3}],"photos":{"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-104.701721,40.403178,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-104.701721,40.403178,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.532441802872709,"count":2019},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Greeley, CO"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/university-of-northern-colorado/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"ad8533ff-f853-4f8f-b89c-16944b083dad","content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"Northern Michigan University","type":"College","url":"northern-michigan-university"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.7587},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":12667},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"760-940"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Freshman","body":"I am born and raised in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan. Going to Northern Michigan University has not been a big change in venue and that! I love the setup of the campus, everything is very easy to locate and everything is in walking distance from the residence halls. I also enjoy how incoming freshman are able o have cars on campus, it's a big help to be able to get home more often. There are a few things that Northern Michigan University could improve on. The parking situation is one of them, although they have added multiple lots to help the problem. Another item that could be better is the dining areas. They could have more of a selection of food throughout the week, which they are also changing for the Fall semester of 2018!","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2018-02-27T18:40:46.249035Z","guid":"f0a072ca-b35a-4bf0-8876-8d38f248e77d","rating":5},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":2.66}],"photos":{"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-87.403857,46.558037,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-87.403857,46.558037,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.5866099893730072,"count":941},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Marquette, MI"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/northern-michigan-university/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"6d1e79e7-e10d-4714-a35b-4d26aefa7b7d","content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"University of Pittsburgh - Greensburg","type":"College","url":"university-of-pittsburgh---greensburg"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.7493},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":16720},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"920-1115"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Senior","body":"The campus is aesthetically pleasing. It is a small campus so you most likely know everyone in the classroom.

The professors just want to see you succeed. As far as campus involvement, there is a lot to do on campus during the week but less on the weekend because it is generally a commuter campus.

Yes like all colleges there are a lot of old buildings, but they have charm and history.  The Wellness Center is amazing--relatively updated and very modern looking.    The food court has also been remodeled and looks great as well.

Students who are motivated, passionate, and hard working, would be great assets to the campus!!!","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2018-02-17T18:12:16.880258Z","guid":"9836f590-cf3a-4413-bba6-e5e3f988d21e","rating":5},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":2.66}],"photos":{"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-75.110661,40.116995,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-75.110661,40.116995,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.609250398724083,"count":627},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Abington, PA"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/penn-state-abington/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"01686ed7-f889-4d7c-951a-6f6fd2babcc3","content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":true,"isPremium":false,"name":"Shenandoah University","type":"College","url":"shenandoah-university"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.8802},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":28310},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"880-1120"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Junior","body":"I have loved my time at Shenandoah! The staff and faculty are all extremely passionate about their specialties. They are open and will sit down and have a heart to heart conversation with you. The campus is warm and inviting, the student life is full of energy and opportunities for involvement. We all come together for the homecoming football games in the fall, and the breathtaking conservatory performances all year round. My favorite time of the year on campus is just before Winter break when campus is all decorated with red and blue Christmas lights. And then there's always the Apple Blossom festival at the end of the spring semester.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2018-01-29T02:40:51.64775Z","guid":"27b5d7f1-e36c-49e5-a4db-c72f01819bcc","rating":4},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":2.66}],"photos":{"default":{"crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/770314a09db578e6b95b42b59f62456fd71a2cd9.jpg","MobileHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/53c5fbec5528139427052d5588fdf75cdb2f898b.jpg"},"licenseName":"UNLICENSED"},"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-78.158376,39.166058,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-78.158376,39.166058,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.5234375,"count":768},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Winchester, VA"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/shenandoah-university/#scatterplot"}}]}
