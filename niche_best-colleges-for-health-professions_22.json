With FAMU comes great opportunities and long lasting friendships. The teachers show a lot of love and support, they don’t look at you as a number, they look at you as family helping family! One thing I would change about Famu is the rule of “Freshman’s not allowed to have cars” I believe that is unfair due to the fact that student students come from all over and a car is their only source of transportation to and from where they live. Allowing them to have a car for the first year would only give them the opportunity to get to and from home and also to and from a variety of attractions and destinations here in Tallahassee.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2017-11-23T05:57:34.467389Z","guid":"feda6c36-a053-4c8d-99d5-a0469e89b639","rating":4},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":3.33}],"photos":{"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-84.285664,30.428599,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-84.285664,30.428599,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.474764756201882,"count":2338},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Tallahassee, FL"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/florida-a-and-m-university/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"dd79308c-7ca1-49de-ad76-6957be74628a","badge":{"display":"Best Colleges in America","ordinal":660,"total":1644,"vanityURL":"best-colleges"},"content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"CUNY Lehman College","type":"College","url":"cuny-lehman-college"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.3248},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":6159},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"910-1080"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Junior","body":"What i like most about Lehman is that there are always great opportunities to move ahead in academics.

The small class sizes definitely help the close atmosphere one can develop with professors. The number of extracurriculars you can apply yourself to are also amazing. There's a club for everything. And I will plug a little about the theater group the College Players as I am a part of that! We have the second oldest student-run college theater group in the USA, second only to Harvard.

It's rather expensive, and not all that good for what you pay for.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2018-04-11T03:58:52.785409Z","guid":"0ab75745-dac9-4eb6-a8a4-f4e191526e37","rating":5},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":3.66}],"photos":{"default":{"crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/7dae0bd0415b38becb368202c46789d31f3df027.jpg","MobileHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/e8ddfe344396ab3b4e56b8499281eed361688a93.jpg"},"licenseName":"UNLICENSED"},"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-122.450977,37.775564,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-122.450977,37.775564,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.5772681954137586,"count":2006},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"San Francisco, CA"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/university-of-san-francisco/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"a6fee292-a097-47f9-bd8e-783a24bb99c2","content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"Indiana University-Purdue University - Fort Wayne","type":"College","url":"indiana-university-purdue-university---fort-wayne"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.9326},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":7270},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"860-1080"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Freshman","body":"IPFW is a very welcoming campus.

Through my many involvements on campus; student organizations, homecoming court, housing employee, and student services employee; I have learned many skills that have been very useful for me professionally.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2018-05-02T19:55:25.231132Z","guid":"46be7376-561d-4bfe-8306-143d23169318","rating":5},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":3}],"photos":{"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-76.355091,39.99813,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-76.355091,39.99813,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.4905231235784684,"count":1319},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Millersville, PA"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/millersville-university-of-pennsylvania/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"8a8c50fd-2a3b-45ea-9e86-c0d7e60bf252","badge":{"display":"Best Colleges in America","ordinal":832,"total":1644,"vanityURL":"best-colleges"},"content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":true,"isPremium":true,"name":"Southern Utah University","type":"College","url":"southern-utah-university"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.7228},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":14024},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"890-1150"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Senior","body":"I love this school!

Once you learn your way around though, being on campus is so much fun!","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2018-01-29T21:34:02.479542Z","guid":"fcd807f7-a79a-4f5a-a733-6b8dcc3dc486","rating":5},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":2.66}],"photos":{"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-93.097715,31.750675,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-93.097715,31.750675,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.690826727066818,"count":883},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Natchitoches, LA"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/northwestern-state-university-of-louisiana/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"d3efb895-57cd-447d-9bc5-1bf585f33648","content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"New Jersey City University","type":"College","url":"new-jersey-city-university"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.8505},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":11854},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"760-990"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Freshman","body":"This will be my first semester at New Jersey City University.

First off, the atmosphere at the University of North Alabama is unlike any other! Seeing as how the school is placed in a quaint little town like Florence, Alabama, everyone is so friendly and you feel right at home. Unlike bigger schools, UNA's professors are able to give students more one on one attention by offering smaller classes, and students feel free to engage more, thus building their success! There are many organizations on campus that adhere to everyone's interests. From being a dancer as a Lionette in the Pride of Dixie Marching Band, to joining the Student Public Relations organization, there are many opportunities for students to gain crucial experience that will build their resumes. I adore UNA, and wouldn't change a thing about it. Did I mention they have live lion mascots on campus?","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2017-07-14T05:57:30.728011Z","guid":"00f6e25b-e83c-4f44-8067-ca825d2043b2","rating":5},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":3.33}],"photos":{"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-87.680999,34.80658,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-87.680999,34.80658,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.7764842840512225,"count":859},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Florence, AL"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/university-of-north-alabama/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"c6a40b5a-047f-411f-997f-670d25d1f5b8","content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"Texas A&M University - Kingsville","type":"College","url":"texas-a-and-m-university---kingsville"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.8234},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":11789},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"850-1060"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Senior","body":"I've had great experiences at Texas A&M University Kingsville college. The professors are helpful, some classmates become your friends, and your advisors become your motivation to push harder in your classes. Throughout the days, months, and years I've gone to college. People learn to become adults because they have to keep up with their assignments, they have to learn to communicate with others around them especially their professors. Ask questions, be honest and don't give up. College is tough but we are not alone, there will always be someone to help you along the way but we must make an effort and try. The number one rule in College is communication. From the experiences I've had in college you learn what it's like to become an adult it may soumd strange to say that but it's true. You are responsible for what happens next. I'll tell you one thing your tears, frustration, discouragement that you feel will eventually lead you to your strength and to your accomplishments in life.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2018-05-30T19:00:09.443743Z","guid":"37a6fa02-290b-4011-9a71-1674345449d3","rating":5},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":2.33}],"photos":{"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-97.882342,27.524852,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-97.882342,27.524852,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.479041916167665,"count":1002},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Kingsville, TX"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/texas-a-and-m-university---kingsville/#scatterplot"}}]}
