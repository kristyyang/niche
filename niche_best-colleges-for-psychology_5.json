Purdue also offers many great opportunities for students to develop leadership through becoming members of one of the hundreds organizations on campus. Lastly, Purdue students can attend many sports events whether it be for the school's football team or even an intramural team game. Purdue has may eateries and study spots so people can meet up for lunch or dinner then study for upcoming exams.

I began to wonder from my previous year of college whether or not college was for me. However, within hours of starting Clemson I began to realize that college here was going to be great.  My professors have embedded within me a love to read, and I have read more books that were not required by my classes, within my two years here, than I had in all of middle school and high school. Even though I did not focus on the social life at Clemson when I first started, I quickly was able to find friends from all backgrounds, some being from various clubs and fraternities, to those on the football team. College game day at Clemson is quite possibly the most exciting sports venue in the United States! Clemson has given me the ability to grow as a person, both academically and socially, and I see myself as being a better man since coming Clemson than I was two years ago before I enrolled here!","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2018-02-26T18:52:02.04411Z","guid":"f168dc56-bd14-406c-afbe-96b454babeda","rating":5},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":4}],"photos":{"default":{"author":"greerjasona","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/866366c511a89c41a22800e481653247a15041da.jpg","MobileHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/92bd9e552f70188d14b8b397043e904e07d8e9d9.jpg","Thumbnail":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/9f3d6145f05e7ee87c4a483379ab7ff1daeb0e44"},"licenseName":"CC BY ","licenseUrl":"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/2.0/","sourceUrl":"https://www.flickr.com/photos/greerjasona/16202933089/"},"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-82.834463,34.677329,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-82.834463,34.677329,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.8071186440677964,"count":2950},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Clemson, SC"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/clemson-university/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"f3315e60-decf-4d24-9051-86c3a287a693","badge":{"display":"Best Colleges for Psychology in America","ordinal":104,"total":993,"vanityURL":"best-colleges-for-psychology"},"content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":true,"isPremium":true,"name":"Trinity University - Texas","type":"College","url":"trinity-university---texas"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.4066},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":28569},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"1160-1370"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Sophomore","body":"I am an international student at Trinity.\n\nTrinity has furnished me with countless great memories.

Throughout campus, students are known for their \"busy culture\"; they are determined to find more to get involved in or accomplish.

I lived on campus for one year and now I commute from my home in Northern NJ. Since my first major is Education of the Deaf and Hard of Hearing and my second Psychology, I have mainly spent my time in the Education Building and the Social Sciences Building. The professors here are incredibly intelligent and love to get to know the students as more than just a number. This is mainly due to the small class sizes, which I believe is one of the benefits of this institution. The professors are willing to work with you outside of class because they truly value your understanding of the subjects.

Spring term at Union is still pretty lit though, given that we have ReUnion weekend, Lobster Fest, and Spring Fest.

After visiting Simpson, Drake, and other private Midwest four year institutions I must say that Creighton's Campus just felt like home.  The professors are all supportive and with a small student to teacher ratio, I feel like an actual person in their classes and can build a relationship with the professors.  The food is excellent, Godfather's Pizza, Chinese, Latin American, Sushi, Burgers, and buffet styled mess halls are a good indication of the different food at Creighton.  The dorms are a little on the dated side, yet they have modern amenities.  The older buildings really gives the place a theme and a warm glow.  Everything is nice and compact seeing that this campus is in the middle of Omaha and all of my classes are within 10-15 minutes of one another.  The advisors are always courteous and listen to the students needs and wants.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2018-05-31T18:36:22.198929Z","guid":"7cb7e8b5-ca43-4732-8bc5-2aa9bae9ad48","rating":4},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":3.66}],"photos":{"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-95.947029,41.265325,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-95.947029,41.265325,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.591194968553459,"count":954},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Omaha, NE"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/creighton-university/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"8c7f93e4-7738-43ab-81e2-876c5fef63ce","badge":{"display":"Best Colleges for Psychology in America","ordinal":114,"total":993,"vanityURL":"best-colleges-for-psychology"},"content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"Loyola Marymount University","type":"College","url":"loyola-marymount-university"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.5387},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":40946},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"1120-1330"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Freshman","body":"This university campus is beautiful!

However, I would recommend that after freshman year, you live somewhere within walking distance to campus, because the parking here is absolutely awful and you will absolutely regret commuting to campus and spending nearly 2 hours looking for a parking spot everyday, even with a parking pass that costs hundreds of dollars. Also Dale Hall is a ridiculous building and if you have a class there, get there early because trying to make your way through the crowds in that building can sometimes take a while.

It is a great school academically and provides all of the opportunities a student could want in terms of good professors, real life experience and a supportive culture. Looking at the social aspect of the school, Butler has a very-tight knit group of student that share similar values (\"The Butler Way\"). Also, it is great to be so close to Broad Ripple and Downtown as this is obviously a big advantage both professionally and socially. Diversity on campus is not great, but I do think it is getting better. All in all, I would 100% recommend Butler if you are still deciding. The BU degree is only becoming more valuable!","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2017-07-15T05:07:31.365341Z","guid":"cd03cdfa-ff75-4137-8851-c2511193db6d","rating":5},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":4}],"photos":{"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-86.171791,39.840662,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-86.171791,39.840662,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.563939634630659,"count":1259},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Indianapolis, IN"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/butler-university/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"e3dffeaa-58fa-41d3-bf56-fe2ea314642c","badge":{"display":"Best Colleges for Psychology in America","ordinal":121,"total":993,"vanityURL":"best-colleges-for-psychology"},"content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"George Washington University","type":"College","url":"george-washington-university"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.4021},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":39562},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"1180-1395"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Senior","body":"I could not have asked for a better school to attend. GWU has the best access to not just amazing learning opportunities, but it is the go to place for internships. I was able to land one with the Treasury, and even got to meet Steven Mnuchin! How many interns can say that? It has also allowed me to develop very strong leadership skills and the ability to work in teams. This school allowed me to grow as a person both personally and professionally.\nThis school does have its flaws. It really needs to work on protecting its students against sexual violence. Not enough has been done, and in this day and age, more needs to be done. GWU is quite expensive, and even though they have good financial aid, they don't provide enough dining dollars to last a semester and that makes getting food a struggle at times.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2018-04-28T01:48:31.229879Z","guid":"354e6e50-c870-4bc6-a741-1a1713999b50","rating":5},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":4}],"photos":{"default":{"author":"taedc","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/6b3620674c0af07db6f502a92844050c136530f0.jpg","MobileHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/881ee2057b5e573c7eabaedf066f8299c9b92c8a.jpg","Thumbnail":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/0a3743d91b38861921a60726bf869dce2ec8b589"},"licenseName":"CC BY-SA","licenseUrl":"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/","sourceUrl":"https://www.flickr.com/photos/taedc/14350595171/"},"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-77.047871,38.89865,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-77.047871,38.89865,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.571353894406691,"count":1913},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Washington, DC"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/george-washington-university/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"5661693d-f152-4d12-b65f-f318532a03d5","badge":{"display":"Best Colleges for Psychology in America","ordinal":122,"total":993,"vanityURL":"best-colleges-for-psychology"},"content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"University of St. Thomas - Minnesota","type":"College","url":"university-of-st-thomas---minnesota"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.8266},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":30791},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"1050-1290"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Freshman","body":"First off, all of the Teachers are amazing, they're office doors are always open and they're willing to help!

The building's collegiate gothic architectural style is beautiful and well maintained. The food there was wonderful, the campus cafeteria put meticulous effort into preparing each meal. The academic side of university of the south is where they excel. The former graduates of the university are well educated and prepared for their career field. The athletics are less than satisfactory however; because the university is so goal oriented towards educating students. Partying at the university is not great because the students are less focused on social affairs. Overall The University of the South is a perfect place to go to college if your goal and life are built around education. I personally love this school, but if you are the sort of person who enjoys less of the scholar side I would not recommend it to you.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2016-09-28T23:50:25.349506Z","guid":"d0f39dfb-ab1e-4944-8b84-db9b302cc862","rating":4},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":4}],"photos":{"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-85.917772,35.20443,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-85.917772,35.20443,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.650990099009901,"count":404},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Sewanee, TN"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/sewanee---the-university-of-the-south/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"62369217-8abf-4ff4-b8db-d1f27dcb1972","badge":{"display":"Best Colleges for Psychology in America","ordinal":125,"total":993,"vanityURL":"best-colleges-for-psychology"},"content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"University of Central Florida","type":"College","url":"university-of-central-florida"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.4999},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":15533},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"1080-1270"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Senior","body":"My experience at the University of Central Florida is everything that any student that ever dreamed of going to college to ever imagine.
