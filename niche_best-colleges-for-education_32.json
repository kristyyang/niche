Depending on the campus you attend, it can range from very safe to fairly safe. For the most part the professors are great and very helpful, they really try their best to make sure their students succeed and understand what is going on. Their academic center is hands down great! They have FREE tutoring sessions throughout the week, including Saturday. All of these tutors have a degree and are VERY helpful. They have not only helped me become successful, but many other students their service. The classrooms are up to date and the campuses are very clean for the most part. I felt safe being on the main campus because of the amount of security on campus.  I do recommend future students or transfer students to attend Southwest because it won't burn a hole in your financial budget, and the professors and staff make you feel at home.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2018-05-25T14:04:12.301051Z","guid":"81116483-ae9b-4262-8033-79930883bad2","rating":4},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":2}],"photos":{"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-90.036543,35.137577,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-90.036543,35.137577,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.4922600619195046,"count":646},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"2 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Memphis, TN"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/southwest-tennessee-community-college/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"26f8d12f-6cfb-4a5f-bd2c-feca11931866","content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"University of Arkansas - Fort Smith","type":"College","url":"university-of-arkansas---fort-smith"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.5581},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":8858},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"780-1160"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Sophomore","body":"As a currently attending student, UAFS has been very excellent.

The food is excellent, Godfather's Pizza, Chinese, Latin American, Sushi, Burgers, and buffet styled mess halls are a good indication of the different food at Creighton.  The dorms are a little on the dated side, yet they have modern amenities.  The older buildings really gives the place a theme and a warm glow.

The administration has been intact for some 40 years, therefore it is very difficult to get things such as food quality, dorm maintenance, and events to change for the better. Although this year was a very academically rigorous year, it did lack in other areas. In the aforementioned areas, students had to organize a sit in protest in order to have our voices and concerns addressed. Academically speaking, Hampton University is not lacking at all, well, at least in my experience. All of my professors were professional, thorough, and cared about the well being and academic journey of their students. Entering my sophomore year, I look forward to how this illustrious institution will grow, or decline!","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2018-05-18T18:54:22.157176Z","guid":"ae3e8cc6-c609-4a16-ae37-ca3c5f628c1a","rating":4},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":2.66}],"photos":{"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-76.337647,37.022084,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-76.337647,37.022084,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.189840944073884,"count":1949},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Hampton, VA"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/hampton-university/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"e13d9100-b21b-49e2-8d37-58c9c4b2a3f9","content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":true,"isPremium":false,"name":"Clayton State University","type":"College","url":"clayton-state-university"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.4092},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":10330},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"860-1000"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Sophomore","body":"Clayton State University is an affordable and diverse college just south of Atlanta. The class sizes are small, the professors are highly involved with students, and every one of them is an expert in their field. I'm studying communication, with a minor in music, and I could not have chosen a better school. The community is excellent, very welcoming. If you are planning on majoring in music, go to Clayton! We have Spivey Hall, a huge season of world-class musicians, and there are lots of opportunities for student teachers and student performers in the surrounding area.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2018-05-07T13:08:53.664803Z","guid":"fbe5974d-233b-407b-af3c-d0b9834ec18b","rating":5},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":2.66}],"photos":{"default":{"crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/e42fb0266fd950f4f668d6cd0f1747f9db808368.jpg","MobileHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/10cece36ce9dc41d3cc85a3cd476d18694fe0490.jpg"},"licenseName":"UNLICENSED"},"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-84.328174,33.594079,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-84.328174,33.594079,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.5428033866415802,"count":1063},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Morrow, GA"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/clayton-state-university/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"5d89ff71-b06d-40e5-a43e-1e94eae70bae","content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"Grambling State University","type":"College","url":"grambling-state-university"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.4514},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":17239},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"810-970"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Freshman","body":"Grambling State University is a great school which is diverse and is located in a great area to reside in.
