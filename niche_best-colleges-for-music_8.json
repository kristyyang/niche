Many of the professors here have gone above and beyond to accommodate for any questions and concerns that I may have. Going to an out-of-state school is very nerve wracking at first, but I am glad that I picked Elon. Elon has become my home away from home in more ways than one and I often find myself counting down the days till I am back on campus. Elon's curriculum can be very intense at times; however, I am getting an education based on the work that I put in. One complaint that I have about Elon is paying for laundry. The cost adds up very quickly and is often frustrating that I have to pay so that I am able to wear clean clothes to class. However, that is the only negative that I have so it doesn't outweigh all of the positive things that Elon has to offer me.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2018-04-19T13:43:25.478388Z","guid":"7f30ce7a-7427-4e25-bd99-8dd8702c2318","rating":5},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":3.66}],"photos":{"default":{"crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/9594d06e83a657e2511ddfd70641a213c2851460.jpg","MobileHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/42f3524b81e18c8a4e7a393354dccf1b6a43db44.jpg"},"licenseName":"UNLICENSED"},"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-79.505632,36.104149,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-79.505632,36.104149,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.5380818053596617,"count":1418},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Elon, NC"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/elon-university/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"533f2386-5857-40b0-89d4-1c7dab149e94","content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"California Baptist University","type":"College","url":"california-baptist-university"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.6399},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":25875},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"850-1100"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Junior","body":"California Baptist University has provided me and most other people I know a space for spiritual growth and a natural urge for academic curiosity. The small classroom sizes (I've been in a class with only 4 people!) allows for 1-on-1 connections between students and professors which has helped me better understand and stay engaged with the courses and the topics of the class. \n\nOne thing to note, I never wanted to attend CBU because of how like-minded the people are. It is a conservative campus and I am a conservative and I am a political science major looking for a challenge. Although professors are usually Christian and conservative,  they put on their Marxist and liberal thinking caps and made their students think about our own views; it was a challenge after all! They really want to help you think outside of the box and become a better individual in academia and in the professional world.

Shuttles that run every 20 minutes, so getting from main campus to downtown is not that hard. The problem is that sometimes drivers are late, they leave early, and some shuttles are too small to hold everyone. Security wise, there are emergency telephones around campus, and campus police drives around occasionally. I had a fantastic stay in the hotel-like freshman dorm, Clearview Hall. Too bad sleeping in the same room as your roommate is the only option. When I became a sophomore, I was upset with the rundown housing in Courtyard South/One. I will be moving to Courtyard North next semester and it is way better! I am not a big fan of the foods, but some days are better than others. The cafe is buffet style with a salad bar, pizza, hibachi, \"main event\", and desserts; they server different things for breakfast, lunch, and dinner.

The campus is a very inviting environment; there are always events going on whether it is sports, diversity, or arts. The professors give off a warm, caring  aroma. No student should be afraid to ask for help from their professor; they are always willing whether it is through office hours or email. MSUM offers many ways to help students succeed; from tutoring to the Wellness Center for physical health. The campus is just the right size, not too small yet not overwhelming as well. As soon as I visited MSUM my senior year of high school, I knew it was home. Though, what I would like to see change is the exclusion from some activities held on campus. For example, they have activities that exclude some students from clubs or learning communities. I wish for more equality in allowing all students to be involved. Otherwise, I believe MSUM is a great place full of opportunities for students to further their education.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2017-11-26T05:07:52.397844Z","guid":"0ece1c33-a37d-4bed-abe0-cadcfc074cbc","rating":4},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":3}],"photos":{"default":{"crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/db9b3a0ff27f272424f505083bf388c9377f84cd.jpg","MobileHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/9579f183666104e0e7185a4591a4b5f6878c5147.jpg"},"licenseName":"UNLICENSED"},"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-96.763376,46.866482,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-96.763376,46.866482,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.4360795454545454,"count":704},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Moorhead, MN"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/minnesota-state-university-moorhead/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"7099c1c4-b34b-4969-9434-226a0a3a3933","content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"Bradley University","type":"College","url":"bradley-university"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.6981},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":26773},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"960-1240"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Senior","body":"Bradley, being a smaller school than a state school, allows students the opportunity to more easily connect with professors in a meaningful way.

Because of this, Bradley is an engaging school with a  lot of benefits!","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2018-05-31T02:24:46.646565Z","guid":"692dc70f-9c68-4d9f-b68c-3c91764e6a9c","rating":4},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":3.66}],"photos":{"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-89.61462,40.697605,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-89.61462,40.697605,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.423076923076923,"count":1066},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Peoria, IL"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/bradley-university/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"be4957e0-cd7e-4d05-b6ae-79481e1deab3","content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"Butler University","type":"College","url":"butler-university"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.7271},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":33290},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"1060-1268"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Alum","body":"Choosing to go to Butler was one of the best decisions I have made in my life. It is a great school academically and provides all of the opportunities a student could want in terms of good professors, real life experience and a supportive culture. Looking at the social aspect of the school, Butler has a very-tight knit group of student that share similar values (\"The Butler Way\"). Also, it is great to be so close to Broad Ripple and Downtown as this is obviously a big advantage both professionally and socially. Diversity on campus is not great, but I do think it is getting better. All in all, I would 100% recommend Butler if you are still deciding.

The professors are very knowledgeable and hold a sincere passion for their fields. I enjoy the fact that students and professors are able to connect personally, so you can really get to know each other. This makes getting references much easier! The opportunities are an additional reason why I enjoy attending WOU. As a psychology major, I have an opportunity to be a research assistant, a teacher's assistant, or both! This provides an opportunity to experience those positions, and determine if they are areas that I want to pursue. WOU also has many activities and clubs, this is great because you can get to meet so many new people. One complaint I have is the advising available at WOU. I would enjoy more being able to sit with my advisor and create an academic plan instead of using an online system that tracks courses and credits.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2017-02-24T21:48:30.011242Z","guid":"ad59a95b-dfc8-4494-a2f2-4e26154f50c0","rating":5},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":2.66}],"photos":{"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-123.238785,44.851866,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-123.238785,44.851866,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.533333333333333,"count":975},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Monmouth, OR"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/western-oregon-university/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"1d82d046-ae89-4750-92ef-06f75376f8b3","content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"Mercer University","type":"College","url":"mercer-university"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.6935},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":20692},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"1100-1290"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Senior","body":"Mercer University is a great school overall.

In addition, there are lots of organizations and volunteer opportunities on campus to help students get involved in the community and feel at home. The campus is absolutely beautiful! However, housing isn't the greatest; some of the dorms are rather old. A few dorms are new or have been renovated recently, so those offer a better living situation. Also, there aren't many food options on campus, and I rarely visited some, as the food was inedible.

I am glad that chose Lee University but wish that the tuition was a little more affordable to reduce the amount of loans that I will have once I graduate.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2018-05-23T16:31:42.823318Z","guid":"1e45edfc-8e71-4671-aae2-cce41af75a38","rating":5},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":3}],"photos":{"default":{"crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/9169e20c314d8846e6dc72a471c7d12547bdf516.jpg","MobileHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/dc6e23d18b183d95c912d4e01bcd64dc796472b8.jpg"},"licenseName":"UNLICENSED"},"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-84.870018,35.166166,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-84.870018,35.166166,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.7564549895324495,"count":1433},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Cleveland, TN"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/lee-university/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"4aca0770-e639-4ace-b678-591202be4b0f","content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"University of Southern Maine","type":"College","url":"university-of-southern-maine"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.8025},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":15019},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"870-1090"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Freshman","body":"University of Southern Maine has a friendly environment. It is very easy to find your way around campus because it is fairly small. There are also a ton of maps around to help you on your way. If there are no maps around, asking someone would do the trick! The professors are willing to help you with any issues or concerns. They have an excellent tutoring program at USM that is free as well! There are so many different ways to succeed here!","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2018-04-25T21:29:35.308147Z","guid":"1719a8cf-d0c6-4b11-ab5b-826169e609f6","rating":4},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":2.33}],"photos":{"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-70.276002,43.662637,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-70.276002,43.662637,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.396604938271605,"count":648},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Portland, ME"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/university-of-southern-maine/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"df086f8b-2e99-46d6-9b7b-7caf88252427","content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"Abilene Christian University","type":"College","url":"abilene-christian-university"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.5089},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":26916},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"930-1160"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Alum","body":"The overall environment at ACU was very welcoming and diverse. I enjoyed being a tutor for one of ACU's classes and was an employee for the on-campus tech support for the entire length of my time at ACU. My professors all really cared about me and my wellbeing. My greatest disappointment with ACU lies with its recently announced policy regarding LGBT student employees as its discriminating and distasteful rhetoric doesn't reflect the actual opinion of the campus population (my engagement with professors, staff, and students and observance of the collective outrage over the policy has confirmed as much for me). As an LGBT student who had an active role in multiple campus positions, it was greatly disappointing to learn the administration's recent decision. I hope that they will revoke this discriminating change, as the community here is really accepting and loving. Many allies rose up over the past semester to challenge the policy and were seen wearing pride pins to graduation.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2018-05-31T23:37:57.218646Z","guid":"4241b7bc-6a52-4584-9ba8-e9b02129bd21","rating":4},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":3.33}],"photos":{"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-99.70954,32.46915,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-99.70954,32.46915,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.68,"count":1225},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Abilene, TX"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/abilene-christian-university/#scatterplot"}}]}
