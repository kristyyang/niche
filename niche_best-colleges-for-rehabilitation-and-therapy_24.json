Central Penn was the only college that I applied to which was very risky but I got in!! With the program and the scheduling at Central Penn I will be able to finish in 1.5 years and get right into the work field. I`m so glad to say that I go to Central Penn College! The one thing that frustrates me at the moment is the schedule and the fact that I have to go to school over the summer but when I am working and everyone I graduated with still has 2 years if college it will all pay off!","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2018-02-18T01:22:33.472378Z","guid":"c7cc1280-e5e5-40e5-b2b9-43d5c3b52a5c","rating":5},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":2.33}],"photos":{"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-76.934461,40.3049,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-76.934461,40.3049,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.8642533936651584,"count":221},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Summerdale, PA"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/central-penn-college/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"a5bce378-fc81-4ea2-8aa2-6cae98bd2dfc","content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"University of Pittsburgh - Titusville","type":"College","url":"university-of-pittsburgh---titusville"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.5026},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":16828},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"825-990"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Sophomore","body":"On this small campus, you are able to really get to know your professors in and out of class, with all the school events as well as running into them if you happen to frequent the campus on your daily life.
