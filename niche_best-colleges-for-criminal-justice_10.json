He got into to several colleges but chose Salve. He liked the smaller campus feel and absolutely loved the campus on the ocean filled with mansions.  The main academic building (O'Hare) was recently renovated (I believe the upgrades were $26 million) including state-of-the-art laboratories and classrooms. He loves the school and the key is to get involved with sports, clubs, volunteering, study groups, and social activities in the dorm. If you are looking for a large college or big time Division I sports, this is probably not your school. However,  if you are looking for a solid school that is on the smaller side with a beautiful campus located in a resort town and personalized attention from professors then you should check out Salve Regina.

Recently, they just became the Golden Wolves after being the Crusaders for many years. They just built a brand new stadium, and added a football team. I play soccer, so I started my first year a week earlier than regular students. My team and I formed a brotherhood and share a bond like no other. We had a great season which featured playoff appearances as a team, and individually, I started every game and scored two game winning goals as a freshman. My coach put lots of faith in me. In the classroom, professors were very involved and seemed to care a lot more than typical college professors. I finished with a 3.6 GPA. The campus is beautiful and small. I know probably half of the student body. There are only two negatives about Alvernia Alvernia is the #1 school in Pennsylvania and #4 in the nation for student debt.

It is very possible to get a 4.0 if you show up to class and put in the effort, which for some classes requires less work than others.

Small class sizes allow students to really take advantage of this network opportunity as well as acquiring thorough knowledge on their field of study. Improvements can be made on the detailed majors available to students. For example, Accounting students can benefit even more by having a program focused on Taxation alone.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2018-04-09T21:18:17.486046Z","guid":"db47a798-2572-4ed8-9b3a-bdc1da983090","rating":4},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":3}],"photos":{"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-73.785635,40.927107,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-73.785635,40.927107,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.448844884488449,"count":606},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"New Rochelle, NY"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/iona-college/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"b041f27f-e07a-4ec9-ad4e-3776e79db563","content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":true,"isPremium":true,"name":"Gwynedd Mercy University","type":"College","url":"gwynedd-mercy-university"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.9082},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":24254},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"840-1030"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Alum","body":"Gwynedd Mercy was a small community which is something I really wanted in a university. I had the ability to be a student-athlete, member of multiple clubs/organizations, study for my bachelor's degree, and work part-time. The faculty and staff were very helpful, especially when it came down to \"crunch time\" and finding a job. I graduated GMercyU on May 12th and secured a teaching position May 14th! I highly recommend Gwynedd Mercy University, especially to education majors!","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2018-06-01T17:51:17.614009Z","guid":"f66a2144-f898-43c8-a1bf-7f15d77f5644","rating":5},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":2.66}],"photos":{"default":{"crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/ed57fd1f18424d3dc297eece106be6fd4aa8e491.jpg","MobileHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/70273016084574b201463fb8679041c59d4a8801.jpg"},"licenseName":"UNLICENSED"},"mapbox_header":{"crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-75.238052,40.197566,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-75.238052,40.197566,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"UNLICENSED"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.5063291139240507,"count":316},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Gwynedd Valley, PA"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/gwynedd-mercy-university/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"88959d7a-13e8-4fba-be19-a0c9c7976a9a","content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"University of Wyoming","type":"College","url":"university-of-wyoming"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.9508},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":13155},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"960-1210"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Sophomore","body":"I love the classes for my major offered by the University. They are engaging with great professors that are approachable outside of lecture. The professors for the music classes are especially great and have made it easy to stay in music even as a non-music major. Getting between classes can be a little difficult as a biology music student but the campus is bike-able which helps a lot! There are so many clubs on campus it is hard to limit yourself to just a handful. I am active in two clubs but also get updates and information for another two clubs. There is lots of outdoor space for enjoying nice weather, which helps for getting out of studying slumps.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2017-08-04T19:36:49.542789Z","guid":"68f5391b-1bc7-4a1c-aba6-d087e541c3e7","rating":5},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":3.66}],"photos":{"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-105.57204,41.311943,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-105.57204,41.311943,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.513142857142857,"count":1750},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Laramie, WY"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/university-of-wyoming/#scatterplot"}}]}
