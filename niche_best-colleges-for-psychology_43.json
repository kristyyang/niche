The availability of guest artists, the opportunity to study with the faculty at CCPA and gain their insight in the area of performance and education serves as a powerful incentive in my choice of study.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2017-12-14T23:56:31.706709Z","guid":"65778b8a-df11-41c8-b5c7-c5738c68536a","rating":5},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":3}],"photos":{"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-87.624952,41.876055,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-87.624952,41.876055,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.6626106194690267,"count":904},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Chicago, IL"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/roosevelt-university/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"14ba174e-3938-47f2-97a1-9f4bad429f17","content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":true,"isPremium":false,"name":"Delta State University","type":"College","url":"delta-state-university"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.8941},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":12792},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"910-1080"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Senior","body":"Delta State University is one of the most affordable colleges in the entire country.

I am a senior, majoring in Healthcare Administration, Bachelor's Degree.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2018-01-05T15:26:59.479538Z","guid":"21abbcc9-cd65-4efe-8c42-0a7f897a0fdc","rating":5},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":2.33}],"photos":{"default":{"crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/db7aa1805ba7bf1dc039b1b8779ba0026326da7b.jpg","MobileHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/4f47cdfd95008b927dc7d8b92c5ee9cff5716cf3.jpg"},"licenseName":"UNLICENSED"},"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-81.648033,35.052919,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-81.648033,35.052919,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.5604395604395602,"count":273},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Gaffney, SC"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/limestone-college/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"b66976b6-cfe1-4c7f-8eef-ce73b14ffe01","content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"University of Bridgeport","type":"College","url":"university-of-bridgeport"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.5778},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":24733},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"840-1010"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Niche User","body":"University of Bridgeport is an amazing school!

The environment makes one feel like it is not for socializing, perhaps small talk, but foremost to succeed in everything.

They have two locations to assist the student.  – The University at Shady Gove in Rockville Maryland and the University in the heart of Baltimore city downtown.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2018-05-26T20:31:56.317527Z","guid":"0209267d-198c-4b1c-9202-1e66ed5227d4","rating":5},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":3.33}],"photos":{"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-76.616591,39.305834,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-76.616591,39.305834,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.597560975609756,"count":492},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Baltimore, MD"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/university-of-baltimore/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"a338f35e-6a34-4cca-b189-b9b357b88c53","content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"Methodist University","type":"College","url":"methodist-university"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.5479},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":30543},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"840-1080"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Alum","body":"Methodist was a great experience for me.

They are very dedicated to their students and are willing to give in their time to help students outside of class. There are also many great opportunities available for personal growth such as joining clubs, studying aboard, and fellowships. The career service here is amazing as well. They help critique your resume for you and help you find internships during the summer. As for academic advising, they help you set up a 4-year plan of what classes you will be taking each semester and will adjust if you plan to study abroad. One thing I would like to see improvements on is racial diversity within the staff/faculty and nonfaculty members. I think it is important that there is diversity within professors and nonfaculty members because some students may feel more comfortable with a professor or staff of color.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2018-04-30T19:57:22.19563Z","guid":"4c1841c2-5fa9-4150-92be-52a2732c9974","rating":4},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade"}],"photos":{"default":{"crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/520d9efed0eeea242193c283dabeaf0dcc1c6a30.jpg","MobileHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/d12e9732c97a347df873d76f7efc47553fcd957f.jpg"},"licenseName":"UNLICENSED"},"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-94.32,45.56,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-94.32,45.56,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.65,"count":580},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"St. Joseph, MN"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/college-of-saint-benedict/#scatterplot"}}]}
