My experience  here has been nothing short of amazing. The students and staff here do everything in their power so that as a whole , the entire university can be successful. I have grew a bond with several staff and students here at Coppin State University that I would have never expected. The teachers are wonderful and humble, and the classes aren't packed where as though it makes it difficult to get the best learning experience there is for yourself. In my opinion Coppin State University is the best HBCU hands down! We know our history, are true to our legacy, and we are moving nowhere but forward. So in closing, my experience here at Coppin State University has filled me with unexplainable joy and undefining hope for the future.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2017-01-23T18:37:38.188683Z","guid":"3ab82fe8-9196-4572-8090-eddc637dd0f1","rating":5},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":1.66}],"photos":{"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-76.658547,39.310786,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-76.658547,39.310786,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.2768959435626104,"count":567},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Baltimore, MD"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/coppin-state-university/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"17bc125d-a7ab-4df1-a556-e0e15ba2fdd1","badge":{"display":"Best Colleges in America","ordinal":275,"total":1644,"vanityURL":"best-colleges"},"content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"Allegheny College","type":"College","url":"allegheny-college"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.6776},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":26517},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"1050-1270"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Alum","body":"Allegheny is a hidden gem to American private liberal arts colleges.

But all in all, I am happy I chose West Virginia because it gave me a chance to learn how to be more independent and prove to myself and others I can be successful.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2018-01-06T11:56:16.127514Z","guid":"b884f60e-dadd-42d3-8131-e64974216376","rating":4},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":2.33}],"photos":{"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-81.76802,38.379002,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-81.76802,38.379002,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.4356435643564356,"count":303},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Institute, WV"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/west-virginia-state-university/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"615c0962-5b92-4418-ade4-0334b0befa9b","badge":{"display":"Best Colleges in America","ordinal":711,"total":1644,"vanityURL":"best-colleges"},"content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"Moravian College","type":"College","url":"moravian-college"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.7982},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":29260},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"900-1120"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Niche User","body":"I loved Moravian so much, especially their new health building.

Central State is an excellent school that anybody would love to attend because of the rich personalities, great hospitality, and wonderful funfilled events","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2018-01-10T21:25:30.302345Z","guid":"bb420ee6-1fd5-4b3d-9aa4-be1b5580895d","rating":5},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":1.66}],"photos":{"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-83.876795,39.716465,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-83.876795,39.716465,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.1646825396825395,"count":504},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Wilberforce, OH"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/central-state-university/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"d433946b-5d26-4d5b-94f7-43e28e779f2a","badge":{"display":"Best Colleges in America","ordinal":623,"total":1644,"vanityURL":"best-colleges"},"content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"Saint Vincent College - Pennsylvania","type":"College","url":"saint-vincent-college---pennsylvania"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.6587},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":22903},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"940-1160"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Freshman","body":"Saint Vincent College is described as a close-knit and rural college founded on Benedictine Tradition.  Not as corny as it sounds.  You know people in major/outside.  News flow isn't always the best. If you bond with teachers and professors easily, you will always have the upper hand.  Professors care and work with you.  Many repeatedly encourage students to visit offices.  Very open. Running trail by cornfields,  wetlands to explore, two lakes, a cemetery, woods, and school is only 2-10 minutes from Walmart/The Mall/etc (Many job opps aside from work study).  Mass held in the basilica on Sunday. Professors are also VERY FRIENDLY monks that live on campus.  Don't feel pressured if not religious, no requirements.\n\nMiscellaneous:\nAthletics huge here.  Will pass several official/intramural teams daily.\nTuition reduced a lot.  Listed price is falsely high.\nSafe.  Quiet/calm weekends.\nHousing OKAY.  Really depends.\nGood food.  Can be repetitive though.  Many vegetarian options.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2017-04-22T12:23:20.697812Z","guid":"57431fe0-f590-4b92-917e-a965fa7669ba","rating":4},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":3}],"photos":{"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-79.403702,40.29252,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-79.403702,40.29252,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.4795081967213113,"count":488},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Latrobe, PA"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/saint-vincent-college---pennsylvania/#scatterplot"}}]}
