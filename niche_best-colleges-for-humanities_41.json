Larger university classes weren’t for me, so Le Moyne was a perfect fit. The professors here actually get to know you and help you whenever needed, offering office hours and meetings by appointments. Le Moyne’s core curriculum requires all students of all majors to take different liberal arts classes, which I think is helpful for students who were unsure of their major starting out. The Jesuit education provided by Le Moyne is thorough and all around excellent. I also commuted to Le Moyne and I found that my professors were always understanding and accomodating if I were ever in the situation where I wouldn’t be able to attend class, such as weather conditions and other external forces that I wouldn’t be able to control. My experience at Le Moyne has been pleasant since day one, and I’m proud to be a soon-to-be graduate from this college.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2017-11-21T17:09:42.782005Z","guid":"cb2d8c6a-ef7d-4c92-be14-586f42c94485","rating":5},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":3}],"photos":{"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-76.088449,43.047316,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-76.088449,43.047316,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.5357142857142856,"count":532},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Syracuse, NY"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/le-moyne-college/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"45458369-ee13-4050-b48e-57b08a57c39f","content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"Abraham Baldwin Agricultural College","type":"College","url":"abraham-baldwin-agricultural-college"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.6561},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":8123},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"820-1048"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Freshman","body":"My freshman experience with Abraham Baldwin Agricultural College has been nothing less than astounding.

My best advice for those that are thinking about coming here is that if you thrive in a chill and relaxed environment, then this is a great place for you! The campus is dead most of the times, so if you are looking for a party school do not come here.  Overall I think the university is great for on campus activities, the knowledgable professors and the small classroom sizes.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2018-05-19T18:57:31.166016Z","guid":"ce0e148d-3991-4838-96a5-c765e70a87c3","rating":4},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":2.66}],"photos":{"default":{"crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/3d4e203434169bc3a3125077b2be973409504bc0.jpg","MobileHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/badf7c1f0fb7e98ffbc11258dc12d2d67564face.jpg"},"licenseName":"UNLICENSED"},"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-155.081329,19.701854,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-155.081329,19.701854,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.2812121212121212,"count":825},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Hilo, HI"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/university-of-hawaii-at-hilo/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"a70f8ef4-e5ac-46df-9caa-3b4680c2572d","badge":{"display":"Best Colleges in America","ordinal":765,"total":1644,"vanityURL":"best-colleges"},"content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":true,"isPremium":false,"name":"University of New England","type":"College","url":"university-of-new-england"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.8306},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":32962},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"940-1150"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Sophomore","body":"So far my experience at UNE has been decent.

I had to sign up for classes on my own which was very difficult being new to the college and their software system I had no idea which classes to sign up for that applied to my particular degree.

The environment is not only clean, but also positive as the people get along with one another. The staff members at Houston Baptist University always strive to encourage the students to do their best in classes and in their personal lives. They also create many different events and to try and engage with the students. The most important thing that Houston Baptist University offers is spiritual growth. The campus has a variety of programs (Bible studies, convocations, etc.) that allow the students to fellowship with their mentors and increase their love for God. Houston Baptist University is an excellent college to attend and a person would not regret applying to this university!","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2018-01-28T01:16:57.28999Z","guid":"c13f0738-0466-4d40-ac16-b1616e229f64","rating":5},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":2.66}],"photos":{"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-95.515978,29.694414,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-95.515978,29.694414,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.659340659340659,"count":728},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Houston, TX"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/houston-baptist-university/#scatterplot"}}]}
