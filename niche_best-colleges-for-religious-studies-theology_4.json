Bryan inspires me to become a better Christian daily, and my relationship with God has definitely grown here.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2017-01-27T22:26:28.86482Z","guid":"bf3a3c8e-78e7-440e-8829-58281a137d3a","rating":5},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":3}],"photos":{"default":{"crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/e9841349a4a0d73b6f739ad538f57d0d033890eb.jpg","MobileHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/26f2047d3f1f6e67835419c32813fec8f90be99f.jpg"},"licenseName":"UNLICENSED"},"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-85.016596,35.495721,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-85.016596,35.495721,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.5436893203883497,"count":206},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Dayton, TN"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/bryan-college---tennessee/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"be55a524-961a-4400-b925-56f2a4723a9e","badge":{"display":"Best Colleges for Religious Studies in America","ordinal":86,"total":197,"vanityURL":"best-colleges-for-religious-studies"},"content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"Indiana Wesleyan University","type":"College","url":"indiana-wesleyan-university"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.7388},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":19519},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"920-1170"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Alum","body":"I had an excellent experience at this university during my three and a half years there.

But our campus contains such diversity that you run into people different than you all the time. Campus activities promote integration of all students, from athletes to bookish types, from African American students to South Korean students.\nThe one thing that many people are weary about is the lifestyle statement, which prohibits many of the 'typical college' activities (smoking, drinking, sex on campus, etc). As an RA, my interactions with the lifestyle statement have given me a broad perspective of the pros and cons of having such an agreement. As a Christian community I think it is imperative that we hold our students to a wholesome standard. However, for those students who do not practice Christianity, I have seen isolation and exclusion on occasion.\nOverall, I love Greenville and am content with my choice for my educational advancement.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2018-02-28T01:52:25.072542Z","guid":"2485c9ef-88ae-471d-846d-63a7487891ef","rating":4},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":3}],"photos":{"default":{"crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/fdd4165fcee1e058a86cf3a51f22704d6bad62b1.jpg","MobileHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/8642a02b748cd3ca2b270e88dceaada520d88779.jpg"},"licenseName":"UNLICENSED"},"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-89.4089,38.8928,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-89.4089,38.8928,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.458974358974359,"count":390},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Greenville, IL"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/greenville-university/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"000bb920-cee5-4a1b-9a23-672b8abddac1","badge":{"display":"Best Colleges for Religious Studies in America","ordinal":88,"total":197,"vanityURL":"best-colleges-for-religious-studies"},"content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":true,"isPremium":true,"name":"Palm Beach Atlantic University","type":"College","url":"palm-beach-atlantic-university"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.9337},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":23444},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"930-1170"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Freshman","body":"Palm Beach Atlantic University is a Christian Private School dedicated to it's students.

Despite the not-so-great food selection, everything else is great! The moment you step on campus, everyone is super nice and welcoming. The fact that it's a small school (which means small class sizes) makes it very easy to develop a close relationship with your professors! The classes are all academically demanding, so as long as you try and do your work, you should be fine! Student life is pretty good as the RA's and CA's, as well as the clubs and organizations around school, come up with some fun events and activities that everyone can enjoy! It honestly is very easy to make friends, especially if you live in the dorms. UST offers some great academic programs and they are very generous when awarding scholarships. Overall, the University of St. Thomas is a great school. As with every school, it does have its pros and cons, but all-in-all, your time spent here is going to be well worth it.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2016-12-20T17:36:38.487154Z","guid":"e33a7126-7e25-4d5c-a9d0-37b691ca0c80","rating":5},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":3.33}],"photos":{"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-95.394178,29.738113,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-95.394178,29.738113,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.5983050847457627,"count":590},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Houston, TX"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/university-of-st-thomas---texas/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"372198fd-cb4b-4f6c-8953-05d1274f8567","badge":{"display":"Best Colleges for Religious Studies in America","ordinal":96,"total":197,"vanityURL":"best-colleges-for-religious-studies"},"content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"Nyack College","type":"College","url":"nyack-college"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.9978},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":17987},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"770-1026"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Niche User","body":"Nyack College is a place where you can grow so much spiritually and as a person alltogether.

I will forever be grateful to be a part of the GATOR NATION!","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2017-12-28T04:16:48.449524Z","guid":"167ffcae-3c48-4a64-bedc-86e9574ac2bc","rating":5},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":4.33}],"photos":{"default":{"author":"97790544@N08","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/42f7de1ac8addec8961d63fe9eaab6e64f731e36.jpg","MobileHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/93bec69c22600ca3a6c83a38ee62521e3e84081b.jpg","Thumbnail":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/fc988e8d76624570feee33fd396f6b7da9ee04ba"},"licenseName":"CC BY-SA","licenseUrl":"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/","sourceUrl":"https://www.flickr.com/photos/97790544@N08/9087756790/"},"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-82.361195,29.638248,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-82.361195,29.638248,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.817323063508211,"count":6881},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Gainesville, FL"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/university-of-florida/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"94f6373f-6764-4187-b67f-87d8d86d8f67","badge":{"display":"Best Colleges for Religious Studies in America","ordinal":103,"total":197,"vanityURL":"best-colleges-for-religious-studies"},"content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":true,"isPremium":false,"name":"Judson University","type":"College","url":"judson-university"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.7485},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":24671},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"910-1230"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Sophomore","body":"Judson University is a great school if you care about a close knit community, ample chances for spiritual development, and caring faculty and staff.

Their graduation rate is 98%, so there is excellent academic programs. I'm personally in the nursing program, both in the BSN and ADN. No other school would let me do both. I'm doing both to allow me to get a year of work experience before graduate school. GW encourages their students to further their education to graduate school. Additionally, GW has huge diversity within the campus. We have many students who live across the world just to come here, a lot of them for sports. Another benefit about going to GW is the security/safety. We have an actual police department on campus that consists of about eight to nine officers on call. Overall GW is one of the best colleges to go to whether you are looking to play sports, all about academics, a safe place away from home, or looking for a new environment!","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2018-03-20T14:56:54.553908Z","guid":"27c35606-55e5-4447-951e-ffe981e71af3","rating":5},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":2.66}],"photos":{"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-81.668141,35.24732,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-81.668141,35.24732,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.604685212298682,"count":683},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Boiling Springs, NC"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/gardner-webb-university/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"5898e94d-dfe7-41e9-b32a-bc649f5d2db1","badge":{"display":"Best Colleges for Religious Studies in America","ordinal":105,"total":197,"vanityURL":"best-colleges-for-religious-studies"},"content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"Kentucky Christian University","type":"College","url":"kentucky-christian-university"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.388},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":20290},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"810-1040"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Senior","body":"Kentucky Christian University has served me by being a place where I can grow spiritually, socially, and academically.
