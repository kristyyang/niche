As a first in family minority student, I was reluctant to go to a big school not known to have a diverse student body. However, I’ve noticed the freshman student body is  more diverse than I expected and the school is not as big as I thought. I see many of the people in my hall around campus. The class sizes are small 15-25 students. The city of Oneonta is cute and transportation to the mall and other main spots is easily accessible. The RA’s are always there to help me with anything big or small. The freshman dorms seem to be the newest! The food is okay, it’s not moms cooking but there’s a lot of selections and 3 main dining halls around campus. Professors have overall been very supportive and helpful. Overall my experience has been very good. There’s many clubs and organizations that can help one branch out and meet new people, College is what you make it!","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2018-01-09T04:21:25.410091Z","guid":"f7a74e4d-846e-48e1-8a96-1e1e0069ea68","rating":4},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":3}],"photos":{"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-75.064186,42.466555,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-75.064186,42.466555,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.5116504854368933,"count":1030},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Oneonta, NY"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/suny-college-at-oneonta/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"cc3a8fce-cec8-4fc2-90a7-9f10bcbdf26b","content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":true,"isPremium":true,"name":"University of Saint Joseph","type":"College","url":"university-of-saint-joseph"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.876},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":29251},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"860-1110"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Sophomore","body":"The University of Saint Joseph is a wonderful school, but it could use some improvement. Although the tuition is high, their financial aid packages cover a lot of the costs. The campus is tiny, but it is nice. Some people have noisy neighbors in the dorms, as I did. They would scream karaoke at 3 am. Our school has \"quiet hours\" set in place, but they didn't always listen. The dorms have no air conditioning so my dorm was always hot. This could just be Assumption Hall. The food is always hit or miss. The Cafe sometimes tries to make fancy meals, but they come out bland. Other times they offer hand rolled sushi and it is delicious. The food is definitely overpriced as well. Lastly, the teachers. Some teacher loves what they're doing and love to work with you until you understand what you are doing. Other teacher don't understand how to convey concepts to students in a manner that is understandable. The class sizes are really small, so you get to know the teachers personally as well.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2018-05-26T12:06:20.707487Z","guid":"f7f3b755-d5e2-43cd-90b2-0e558278de46","rating":4},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":2.66}],"photos":{"default":{"crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/50cd8ad6a79a3f908b24b1eef182c511b41a3a7f.jpg","MobileHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/f03192df6ed14f508ab1f24f90449f9a08d806a6.jpg"},"licenseName":"UNLICENSED"},"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-72.730489,41.783028,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-72.730489,41.783028,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.437888198757764,"count":322},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"West Hartford, CT"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/university-of-saint-joseph/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"3f54e043-087d-4db0-b0ab-329ee2ced21d","content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"Rowan University","type":"College","url":"rowan-university"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.7101},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":18067},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"1020-1230"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Sophomore","body":"Rowan has a very diverse campus with many clubs ranging in interest.

They tend to higher previous students which means there is no way you can get a job on campus unless a student who works for them graduates.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2018-02-08T23:24:09.771511Z","guid":"1b6e3818-0039-44fd-bcbb-8263443cfc2d","rating":4},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":3.33}],"photos":{"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-80.086258,42.126111,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-80.086258,42.126111,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.4345479082321186,"count":741},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Erie, PA"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/gannon-university/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"d8183760-7ab8-44e9-9f89-e149bf4e942f","content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"North Carolina A&T State University","type":"College","url":"north-carolina-a-and-t-state-university"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.5364},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":9548},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"850-1010"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Senior","body":"North Carolina A&T was not my first choice, but I am delighted I chose this school.

MSUM offers many ways to help students succeed; from tutoring to the Wellness Center for physical health. The campus is just the right size, not too small yet not overwhelming as well. As soon as I visited MSUM my senior year of high school, I knew it was home. Though, what I would like to see change is the exclusion from some activities held on campus. For example, they have activities that exclude some students from clubs or learning communities. I wish for more equality in allowing all students to be involved.

Overall, Meredith proves to be an excellent environment for obtaining your degree!","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2018-01-04T18:12:55.906771Z","guid":"2840e2f7-297b-458c-b687-8bcfaef23729","rating":5},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":3.33}],"photos":{"default":{"crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/8aa59d80e8c3266ee8edc510f321e9405c678f67.jpg","MobileHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/5e6d32caa66ed8349c61e43c954c4a5a6110dd42.jpg"},"licenseName":"UNLICENSED"},"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-78.689175,35.797197,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-78.689175,35.797197,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.852359208523592,"count":657},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Raleigh, NC"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/meredith-college/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"d171c072-f841-423e-9cc1-c4c07a05918e","content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"Hamline University","type":"College","url":"hamline-university"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.703},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":22676},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"960-1230"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Freshman","body":"I am about to start my second semester as a freshman at Hamline University, and I have had very little to complain about. My professors first semester were all so helpful and invested in truly helping their students succeed. Their office hours were always super open to students, and they were some of the friendliest people I have met. Although the school is originally very expensive, they offer many scholarships and loans through financial aid that make attending the university infinitely more affordable. Classes were neither too  easy nor too difficult. They were just enough work to challenge me, but not overwhelm me. If I had any complaints about Hamline, they would fall into the residential life category. My dorm is very old and in need of some renovation. The toilets and showers are always broken, and the elevator does not always work. The size of my room is perfect, though. Unfortunately I will not be living on campus next year due to the old living facilities, though.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2018-01-23T19:14:32.5679Z","guid":"eed8b157-d70e-467c-bcf8-28010360c261","rating":4},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":3}],"photos":{"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-93.163983,44.965696,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-93.163983,44.965696,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.426892950391645,"count":766},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Saint Paul, MN"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/hamline-university/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"860d91fd-a1b3-435f-948f-aa473e2c0493","content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":true,"isPremium":false,"name":"Spalding University","type":"College","url":"spalding-university"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.503},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":20859},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"883-1106"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Sophomore","body":"The students are VERY diverse, especially when it comes to sexuality.

Although it may be great, it does have a fair share of problems. Unfortunately you may end up spending extra money on books when certain professors make you buy their syllabus for money(BIB 111).
