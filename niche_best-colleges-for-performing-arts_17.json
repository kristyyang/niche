It is a gorgeous campus. It also has an amazing staff who take the time to know you well. It is a Southern Baptist school, so most of the students have more conservative values although they are not insanely conservative and are very open minded to the ideas of other individuals. Samford is also located in a nice area of Birmingham, AL that offers enough fun to try something new every weekend. The area also contains many healthy churches that can enrich your college experience ten-fold.\nThere are some pitfalls. The diversity here is a bit pitiful and the conservative atmosphere of the school may also be suffocating to certain individuals. Parties are fairly few and far between. However, it is easy to find other places in Birmingham to party or dance if you are looking for that sort of scene.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2018-01-19T18:22:13.325725Z","guid":"b798cac4-162b-4396-9ee9-bb303e73ad0f","rating":5},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":3.66}],"photos":{"default":{"crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/15fccd3ac6b7a2c2969729c22316a789adc3748f.jpg","MobileHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/8ad7f28e75dee67d79ce128d598ad4705f4728f3.jpg"},"licenseName":"UNLICENSED"},"mapbox_header":{"crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-86.790932,33.464578,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-86.790932,33.464578,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"UNLICENSED"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.7466666666666666,"count":675},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Birmingham, AL"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/samford-university/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"e12f5d40-fc14-4747-b893-0aa7f41a07ce","content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":true,"isPremium":true,"name":"Fort Lewis College","type":"College","url":"fort-lewis-college"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.9212},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":17918},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"940-1120"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Alum","body":"Fort Lewis College is a school where students can participate in multiple club activities and sports.

It was easy to enroll, and the professors are very nice and understanding. The campus itself is on the smaller side, so the classes are easy to find. The professor to student ratio is very good as well, and the class sizes get smaller and smaller as you progress.

The professors really care about each student's needs and goals, and they are willing to help students at a personal level. There is always something to do on campus and most people I have met (in and out of classes) are nice and outgoing. The campus definitely has a home feel for me. Some downsides are the food (which isn't great) and some of the extra things that come with it being a small school. For example, registering for certain majors can be extremely difficult because of limited class options and there are less options for housing, food, and activities than on a larger campus. Des Moines is also a nice in-between sized city!

But that is what makes Elmhurst the best college to go to! Having a small number of students in your field of program such as Elementary Education is crucial. That means there are not that many graduates from a great college looking for a job in the same area as you. You are able to build a relationship with each of your professors because the class size is about 20 students. Having a real connection with your professor means they get to know you and you get to know them. They will be great references or write great recommendations for whatever you need. In addition to professors, you create long lasting friendships with your peers. Everyone becomes close and you  support each other to get through the semester. I recommend applying to Elmhurst College first. It can be competitive to get in, but that is because they should be your number one choice!","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2017-01-20T21:53:23.668045Z","guid":"2d55ff0b-095b-48bf-8332-698f999e5716","rating":5},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":3}],"photos":{"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-87.946096,41.899215,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-87.946096,41.899215,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.5140845070422535,"count":710},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Elmhurst, IL"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/elmhurst-college/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"26baab19-ef79-40b2-a17d-2bda477423a1","content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"Pacific Lutheran University","type":"College","url":"pacific-lutheran-university"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.7682},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":25219},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"980-1230"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Freshman","body":"The university provides a very inclusive community of students and faculty aimed at helping you to succeed! With a lovely campus and campus life, I would recommend Pacific Lutheran University to all students!
