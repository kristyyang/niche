There is always something to do at Findlay; whether that means a club activity, free food, free shirts, seminars, concerts and many other possibilities. The professors, staff and students are all very friendly and great to be around. The campus is well maintained and beautiful in the spring and summer.

There is plenty there if you grab it.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2018-05-25T19:01:31.291123Z","guid":"5e5fed39-5d34-462e-9cae-0ed359833037","rating":5},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":2.66}],"photos":{"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-83.624499,42.245751,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-83.624499,42.245751,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.4503844745514463,"count":2731},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Ypsilanti, MI"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/eastern-michigan-university/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"f4eda9c6-285a-4f42-83ea-11485a82197e","content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"Central Connecticut State University","type":"College","url":"central-connecticut-state-university"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.6001},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":14852},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"900-1100"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Alum","body":"I attended Central Connecticut State University (CCSU) for two and a half years. During this time, I acquired my Bachelor of Arts in Social Work while receiving a  minor in Psychological Science. One thing I noticed while enrolled at the university is that the teachers were very proactive in ensuring the best learning environment for their students. I found that the professors made themselves available to students who needed extra time outside of classroom time to process materials being taught in class. As a young African American Woman, I was further impressed by not only the diversity of the university's  faculty but also their students. Overall, my experience at CCSU was positive. The only thing I would change is for the university to be as considerate to traditional students as they are to non-traditional students as it relates to class availablity.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2018-02-02T15:20:29.113994Z","guid":"ec08d80e-79bf-40e3-b696-0782ce36de86","rating":4},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":2.66}],"photos":{"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-72.770094,41.690258,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-72.770094,41.690258,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.3884156729131174,"count":1174},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"New Britain, CT"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/central-connecticut-state-university/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"1368f5bc-1447-469d-b06c-5c69a8b37a6a","badge":{"display":"Best Colleges in America","ordinal":502,"total":1644,"vanityURL":"best-colleges"},"content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"University of Hawaii at Manoa","type":"College","url":"university-of-hawaii-at-manoa"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.8498},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":13520},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"970-1190"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Senior","body":"The Good: Excellent distance learning for students who live off island!

Greek life on this campus to me is one of the best in the country and one of the most wonderful organizations I've had the opportunity to be apart of. It not only provides an inclusiveness towards other organizations and the campus as a whole, but encourages students to work harder in both academia and community service. Along with Greek life this university has also provided many leadership opportunities that I wouldn't have had, had I gone somewhere else. While diversity on this campus tends to be lacking I was able to work with different multicultural organizations to change that aspect.

Fresno State is a clean, friendly, and safe environment. It’s nice knowing I am on a safe campus, I feel safe here! The professors are very oriented, some really care about the students education and they are willing to help those who are having trouble throughout the course. The atmosphere around here is fulfilled with energized and motivated students. When I go into the library to do some work, the students are very committed into getting their work done. Living on campus has been such a fun and great college experience so far, and I’m glad I was able to experience the dorm life here at Fresno State. When I have questions, the professors are more than happy to help, and the staff on campus is just overall very helpful. Personally, I love to watch sports, and going to some sports games is really diverting. Overall, my experience at Fresno State has been very abundant!","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2018-03-01T18:35:34.956161Z","guid":"23e57e9f-9286-4638-a082-03199ad47939","rating":5},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":3}],"photos":{"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-119.748258,36.814477,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-119.748258,36.814477,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.5158562367864694,"count":2365},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Fresno, CA"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/california-state-university---fresno/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"d4c80d9a-3106-4d1d-96fc-32b1612f5853","content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"San Jose State University","type":"College","url":"san-jose-state-university"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.5344},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":13777},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"920-1150"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Senior","body":"SJSU is an AWESOME college campus and has a AMAZING education system. The university was built in the 1850's and is one of the oldest in the West Coast college systems!\n\nSJSU is VERY WELL CONTAINED I.e. Campus housing; academic, social and athletic activities; campus police/policing; MANY food choices. There is definitely not a need or reason for  FROSH (freshmen) to leave campus. \n\nWe love the university is DIVERSE ethnically, academically and socially.  SJSU is centrally located in the heart of San Jose. It's surrounded by a lot of great culture and beautiful old architecture.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2017-10-02T00:07:17.300014Z","guid":"1826660a-ddd3-40d9-ad4b-d561d111425c","rating":5},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":2.66}],"photos":{"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-121.881214,37.335201,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-121.881214,37.335201,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.5340785169029445,"count":3668},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"San Jose, CA"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/san-jose-state-university/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"f1beaf3e-6d1e-4f1c-9095-edc88fcee003","badge":{"display":"Best Colleges in America","ordinal":584,"total":1644,"vanityURL":"best-colleges"},"content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"Pace University","type":"College","url":"pace-university"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.8368},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":31040},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"940-1160"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Freshman","body":"I really like it here at Pace University, there are so many opportunities available to students. The location is a definite plus, as most New York attractions are just a short walk or subway ride away. The academics are exceptional and it is especially advantageous for Business majors to be located in the heart of Wall Street. Aside from that, there are many campus activities and clubs for students to join, and there is always free food available at one event or the other! The faculty are very helpful and they are invested in seeing students succeed, which can really help boost student morale. In addition to this, the university really pushes for real world experience, like internships, and the career services department is a great resource for students to utilize in their search for such experiences.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2018-04-19T04:46:05.82642Z","guid":"93484419-e007-4bae-9406-73c69997f6ac","rating":5},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":3}],"photos":{"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-74.004719,40.711014,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-74.004719,40.711014,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.5303896103896104,"count":1925},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"New York, NY"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/pace-university/#scatterplot"}}]}
