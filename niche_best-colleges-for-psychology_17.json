I came into this school having no direction or plan and it wasn't long before Roanoke helped me discover my passion. Small class sizes make it so easy to develop connections with both your classmates and professors. You aren't just a number here, and, personally, these connections have helped me grow and recognize my strengths and talents. In return, I have been given so many wonderful opportunities at this school that have truly prepared me for life after graduation.

On orientation day the staff made me feel so welcome, everyone was so friendly, and not because they had to be, it was truly genuine! The actual DEAN of my department spent over an hour with me helping to map out my first semester by going over different course selections available for me, helping to make sure I didn't waste time or money picking classes that would not benefit my intended major. The academics are challenging and many employers see Stockton University as a highly credited institution to graduate from. I highly recommend any student looking for a college where they will easily fit in and belong. There are so many activities to keep busy and because Stockton is situated in the heart of South Jersey, its relatively close to anything you could need. Between Atlantic City, Philadelphia and New York City there are endless possibilities for fun weekends away!","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2018-01-03T20:12:47.835856Z","guid":"28164049-e7d5-4296-927e-905ced0ce649","rating":5},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":3.33}],"photos":{"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-74.531087,39.492036,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-74.531087,39.492036,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.649390243902439,"count":1312},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Galloway, NJ"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/stockton-university/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"4f36b886-599a-46bb-9861-e309e3a699d5","content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"Eastern Kentucky University","type":"College","url":"eastern-kentucky-university"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.8633},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":12255},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"930-1140"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Freshman","body":"I have only been here one full semester, but I already love this college.

Overall, a wonderful experience thus far.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2018-01-23T22:03:00.545566Z","guid":"d72ea003-2aad-44f7-99ed-5f7deffdf7ff","rating":5},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":3.33}],"photos":{"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-122.445372,47.145494,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-122.445372,47.145494,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.5839243498817965,"count":846},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Tacoma, WA"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/pacific-lutheran-university/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"7b221df5-a49d-49e4-9acf-52e21878997e","content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"University of Minnesota - Morris","type":"College","url":"university-of-minnesota---morris"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.5806},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":11589},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"1020-1270"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Junior","body":"This university provides a high quality education at an approachable price point.

Here, we aspire to be very politically and socially aware of different issues going around the world. There are organizations directed to many communities and they are really welcoming. Outside the classroom, those organizations could potentially become your family. The great thing about The New School is that it is very respectful of individuality. If you are a very \"on you own\" person that is respected but if you love being with people and socializing all the time you can find your space too.

It gives you an opportunity to network and meet the different kinds of people you find on this campus. The library's service is always on point! They've always been so helpful and it's never been too crowded for me to get a spot at the computer lab or have a place to study. My professors were amazing in every way and I never once left the classroom with unanswered questions. Communication is reliable with professors as long as you attend classes as regularly as possible. At Wingate, you'll get a nice exercise because walking is mostly how students get around.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2017-12-29T04:17:21.879159Z","guid":"373eda2f-6d47-4d38-85fd-747eab8dc3aa","rating":5},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":3}],"photos":{"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-80.444465,34.979384,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-80.444465,34.979384,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.5716612377850163,"count":614},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Wingate, NC"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/wingate-university/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"f1d14db3-7297-4753-b76f-7ad0b42bec55","content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"Utah State University","type":"College","url":"utah-state-university"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.9025},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":13037},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"980-1220"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Junior","body":"I have thoroughly enjoyed my time at Utah State University. The professors are very engaging and willing to help their students. Furthermore, USU’s campus and the city of Logan are both amazing. I am very grateful for the opportunity I have had to go to school here. My only complaint is this: the counseling office at the business school is deplorable. The counselors are unworkable, slow, and useless. Nevertheless, the school and education itself are very good. In addition, I have enjoyed the student body at USU. They are humble, hardworking, and fun. Overall, I give Utah State University a four-star rating. They provide a great education for a reasonable price. Keep up the good work USU!","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2018-04-28T02:34:51.274997Z","guid":"a92c12b3-6c6e-40a0-a5e9-0f295ef4cdb2","rating":4},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":3.33}],"photos":{"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-111.81391,41.740748,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-111.81391,41.740748,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.8143459915611815,"count":4029},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Logan, UT"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/utah-state-university/#scatterplot"}}]}
