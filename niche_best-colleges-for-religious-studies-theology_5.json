By that, I mean that it's smaller than my high school. To be quite honest, there really isn't much to do within the town of Davidson, and without a car, Charlotte isn't exactly accessible. I knew all too well of this, but I still decided to come here because Davidson genuinely is an amazing school. Professors are very engaged with their students and I can definitely see how passionate they are about the courses they teach. Class sizes are great as well, with several of my classes having fewer than 15 students and none over ~30. While diversity of the student population leaves something to be desired, Davidson is slowly improving.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2018-05-02T04:56:40.035205Z","guid":"a1640b05-25eb-482b-bc41-64af8fe060b1","rating":5},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":4.33}],"photos":{"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-80.845236,35.500006,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-80.845236,35.500006,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.8776978417266186,"count":278},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Davidson, NC"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/davidson-college/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"38b5a1e7-d78d-4561-b8a3-ff91e90f11f5","badge":{"display":"Best Colleges for Religious Studies in America","ordinal":107,"total":197,"vanityURL":"best-colleges-for-religious-studies"},"content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"Geneva College","type":"College","url":"geneva-college"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.7057},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":20223},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"950-1180"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Freshman","body":"Geneva College is  great school.

There is always someone there willing to lend a helping hand. The campus is absolutely gorgeous, it has great intimate class sizes that are perfect for hands-on learning with a comfortable environment laying as its foundation, and there are so many ways to get involved with the school and its people through clubs, athletics, organizations, and all the opportunities that stem from these venues.

The campus feel is everything I was looking for in a college and I wouldn't change a thing. There are plenty of food services offered and plenty of variety and delicious options. As far as rooming options go for first year students, Saint Thomas offers 2 incredibly nice options and two decently nice options, so no matter which dorm you get you know that you’ll be comfortable and apart of a lively atmosphere. All and all, its impossible to stress how at home I feel here and anyone who steps foot on the campus and talks to someone who works or attended this school would know why.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2018-01-19T20:55:56.465563Z","guid":"478010fe-1382-4c27-9ee6-648e3046124f","rating":5},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":4}],"photos":{"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-93.189422,44.941662,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-93.189422,44.941662,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.765740740740741,"count":1080},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Saint Paul, MN"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/university-of-st-thomas---minnesota/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"dd8f9259-9711-4e94-a1a6-5569662b9ac0","content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"Eastern Mennonite University","type":"College","url":"eastern-mennonite-university"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.6115},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":23452},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"890-1170"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Sophomore","body":"I enjoy EMU because of their emphasis on community building, sustainability, and peace building.

They are very well known all over the country for their School of Engineering, which is the reason I am there, and I have to say I am very impressed with their organization of classes, schedules, and events not to mention how excellent the Professors are. Most of them have their Doctorate and are knowledgable well above their years. If this sounds like a University that fits you, I encourage you to give it a shot for yourself and take a tour here sometime.
