I was very impressed during the summer science program I attended in 2017.  My greatest accomplishment was my ability to be the student during the summer science program to receive the overall student achievement. Not only was I surprised, I was absolutely elated. I value the academic challenge Toygaloo offers.  Tougaloo is a private historic kept secret and many people are not aware of the opportunity that this great HBC can offer.  The alumni association is also very encouraging and supportive in more ways than one, but I also have to say the campus can use a more modern updated look.  Tougaloo has been around a long time and mostly all funds come from private donors, with that in mind I understand that the funds are used for people like me to be funded for college books, housing and etc and that can be very costly.  If I could change just one thing I would surely hope this would be the one thing that could possibly be changed.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2018-05-18T22:47:55.917572Z","guid":"150fbea7-1674-44f9-8a1a-ff0e909b1ce0","rating":4},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":2.33}],"photos":{"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-90.159405,32.402719,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-90.159405,32.402719,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.311203319502075,"count":241},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Tougaloo, MS"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/tougaloo-college/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"a490b51d-bffc-40f8-bf2b-e934a0d69612","content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"Defiance College","type":"College","url":"defiance-college"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.5818},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":24995},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"790-1010"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Senior","body":"My experience at Defiance College has overall been excellent.

The campus is small and everything is easily accessible, no running across massive campus to get from class to class. The class sizes were small so it allowed for Professors to teach on a more personal basis. The professors were almost all  fair and excellent as well, there was only one I would complain about but is no longer employed. The people are friendly, however the population did not seem very diverse. There were plenty of places to relax or study as a commuting student, and parking spaces were not too bad to locate for the most part. Classes were challenging but practical and allowed for great preparation.

Other than the school being in the middle of nowhere, there's really nothing I can complain about. I'm able to major and minor in things that I am genuinely interested in. I've alway been interested in getting careers in the human service and mass communications field so I have chosen those as my major/minor. Also, I love the history of this school. Lincoln University is the first degree granting Historically Black College/University (HBCU) and in my opinion, for them us to be the first, I see it as us setting a standard and paving the way for other HBCUs.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2018-04-18T00:05:19.124148Z","guid":"8f5ea61b-fc64-4ee2-b941-2c4c3d9d6019","rating":5},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":2}],"photos":{"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-75.928273,39.807725,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-75.928273,39.807725,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.2910547396528704,"count":749},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Lincoln University, PA"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/lincoln-university-of-pennsylvania/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"6575cd69-4999-4cdb-95c8-34a88219706d","content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":true,"isPremium":false,"name":"Sweet Briar College","type":"College","url":"sweet-briar-college"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.9305},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":25532},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"880-1180"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Sophomore","body":"I love Sweet Briar dearly!

Everyone there is very close knit because of the small class sizes and how it arranged.

At the beginning of freshman year they have a 3 week trip down the Yukon River so everyone can get to know each other and build relationships.
