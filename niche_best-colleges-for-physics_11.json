With a campus in the \"capital of the world\", the location provides opportunities unrivaled by others.  By planning ahead, you can schedule classes with some top-notch professors who actively help students succeed and provide an unforgettable learning experience.  Though Core requirements are extensive, even excessive to some, they make way for an education that explores all fields.  The Jesuit presence is in no way overbearing and the community is open to a diversity of thought (Professors are almost always unrelated to the Church; even theology classes teach a variety of religions).  The Rose Hill campus is quite beautiful, boasting sports teams, a large library, and a variety of eateries.  Both campuses are very safe and any incidents are vigilantly pursued by campus safety and the NYPD. Fordham can be a very good experience, if deemed worth the price point (note they do award aid) and if one is willing to take advantage of their time there.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2018-06-05T17:39:23.039915Z","guid":"c7e106e7-e1c4-45d2-8987-d3382185aaa0","rating":4},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":3.66}],"photos":{"default":{"crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/58a16aa62394c04c88abf70482b6dfc699f8d219.jpg","MobileHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/2a5478c448466060f510b754b7a99112cf2dbc0c.jpg"},"licenseName":"UNLICENSED"},"mapbox_header":{"crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-73.889578,40.861183,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-73.889578,40.861183,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"UNLICENSED"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.4920049200492005,"count":1626},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Bronx, NY"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/fordham-university/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"127c595c-1189-4f6a-bab1-4e1fb7248c61","content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"Wichita State University","type":"College","url":"wichita-state-university"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.8623},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":14175},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"915-1220"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Sophomore","body":"What I definitely love the most about Wichita State are the students. Everyone is connected to a very large friend group - from the people in their classes, to former or current roommates to friends of friends - and I love that! I'm a really extraverted person, so being able to make lots of connections and build relationships is something I find a lot of enjoyment in. However, I will say one of WSU's greatest downfalls is the use of Graduate Teaching Assistants (GTA) to teach an entire class. I know they'll have to one day teach a class, but a lot of the GTAs seem a little unprepared for it. Also, off the GTAs I have, some of them have even taught lecture for twenty minutes and let students go. Professors can take up the full hour with one lecture, so GTAs should be held to the same standard. In all honesty, this is just a small problem I have with WSU so far, so I hope it will change as I go forward in my degree program!","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2017-11-03T22:54:13.895863Z","guid":"3d22924d-21f9-46d1-8e96-5bad0f6904f9","rating":4},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":2.66}],"photos":{"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-97.296733,37.716484,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-97.296733,37.716484,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.586053412462908,"count":1348},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Wichita, KS"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/wichita-state-university/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"d27ab0e0-17e9-4562-b987-bcc1457d45e7","content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"University of Colorado - Denver","type":"College","url":"university-of-colorado---denver"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.6052},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":13751},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"960-1190"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"College Sophomore","body":"My experience at CU Denver has surpassed my expectations.

My favorite experiences so far have been the community events organized by the campus. The first week always consists of different activities and events everyday so that students can gather around the campus, get to know others, learn about clubs/activities, and get food and school themed clothes as well. My campus has a block party in Denver since it's right across the street where music and food is provided, along with tables and tents promoting all the clubs and organizations available on campus.

With that being said the array of extracurricular activities available to students is fantastic. Greek life on this campus to me is one of the best in the country and one of the most wonderful organizations I've had the opportunity to be apart of. It not only provides an inclusiveness towards other organizations and the campus as a whole, but encourages students to work harder in both academia and community service. Along with Greek life this university has also provided many leadership opportunities that I wouldn't have had, had I gone somewhere else. While diversity on this campus tends to be lacking I was able to work with different multicultural organizations to change that aspect. All in all the University of Maine is a school worth attending if you have a specific plan.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2018-04-09T19:43:53.955304Z","guid":"d4139b76-2ad0-4055-baef-a319c6145b2f","rating":4},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":3}],"photos":{"default":{"crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/a4bf3efc1a87174e1309c2eb31a3ec49183286e3.jpg","MobileHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/c774187efe47ea9fb1599fc367c7d043324b3c9a.jpg"},"licenseName":"UNLICENSED"},"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-68.673839,44.895966,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-68.673839,44.895966,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.4721052631578946,"count":1900},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Orono, ME"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/university-of-maine/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"5198060a-40a9-4ead-830a-eed06398709e","content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"Radford University","type":"College","url":"radford-university"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.812},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":14084},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"890-1060"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Freshman","body":"Radford University is the perfect school to help new student embrace their personality and not be afraid to try new things.

What I like to see a change in Humboldt is to give a more housing chances for students that are from far away. More housing in the campus for everyone to be. It is tough to find an apartment or house near the school and have the housing costs to be low, for future students coming from different parts of California or an out of state transfer, they should have the opportunity to have a low-cost housing and a secure home to be in.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2018-06-04T07:47:55.941084Z","guid":"69c3f499-369e-44c2-b940-7c35a6e57796","rating":4},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":3}],"photos":{"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-124.0814,40.8741,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-124.0814,40.8741,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.5448863636363637,"count":1760},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Arcata, CA"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/humboldt-state-university/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"8f83ef77-04b7-4d20-9267-e2739ca2f84f","content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"Stockton University","type":"College","url":"stockton-university"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.7694},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":14367},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"960-1160"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Senior","body":"From day one, as a transfer student Stockton won me over with its incredibly genuine, warm, caring staff.

So far Kutztown has been great!","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2018-02-09T23:35:07.153386Z","guid":"983dbb21-731f-4b08-bc10-387b9fe74fdc","rating":4},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":2.66}],"photos":{"default":{"crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/afd8b66b572da434133adc2760d1caed10aba446.jpg","MobileHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/07c737e157b9140f00102f72efdcc94ccd064996.jpg"},"licenseName":"UNLICENSED"},"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-75.785426,40.513705,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-75.785426,40.513705,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.4009797060881737,"count":1429},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Kutztown, PA"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/kutztown-university-of-pennsylvania/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"051b166a-6312-4446-a9ae-2258a40ed137","content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":true,"isPremium":true,"name":"Colorado Mesa University","type":"College","url":"colorado-mesa-university"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.8275},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":13529},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"870-1090"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Sophomore","body":"Colorado Mesa University was the right choice for me and I'm sure it is for you too.  It is a wonderful school with a beautiful camps and great professors. The class sizes are the perfect size, your professor actually get to know your name and they really care about your education. The student life at CMU is great there's never not an activity going on, and if you don't want to stay on campus there many activities just minutes away from the CMU. Weather you like hiking, mountain biking, skiing, paddle boarding you name it then CMU is the right choice for you. And even if you've never done any of those thing CMU has a wonderful Outdoors program that will take you on trips and teach you the basics. Outdoors activites not for you that's okay we have a great rec gym with racquetball courts, basketball courts, rock climbing wall and even a Olympic size swimming pool. So come check out CMU we'd love to have you join our Mavley.

I have gone to both Washington State University and the University of Idaho, and I believe the University of Idaho gives students a very high chance to succeed. I love the University of Idaho because to the faculty and staff, you are not just a number like you are at larger schools such as WSU. These people here actually care about you and take the time to get to personally know you and understand you and try and get the most out of you. Another thing is, professors at UI do all they can to help you find internships and jobs because they actually care and want everyone to succeed. I would highly recommend the University of Idaho.

I think the teachers provide an enthusiastic teaching environment, and it helps to transition the freshman from being in high school to a whole new environment: college. I love the shade provided on the campus, but I do think there should be more of it, especially with the heat and vigor the sun gives during the summer months of Turlock. Perhaps each graduating class could plant a tree to help promote saving the environment, and make a positive impact as they face the world outside of college! There could be a \"forest of the future\" to help encourage the students to graduate and to leave their mark on the Stanislaus campus.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2017-10-09T06:12:36.072878Z","guid":"eb5164db-4c25-4b93-82e9-1c0de5fbd407","rating":4},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":3}],"photos":{"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-120.852511,37.52577,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-120.852511,37.52577,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.5944609297725023,"count":1011},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Turlock, CA"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/california-state-university---stanislaus/#scatterplot"}}]}
