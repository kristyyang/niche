The main reasons as to why I have enjoyed Westminster the most is because of the small class sizes, typically a 20:1 ration. This allows for students to feel more connected with the professors than they would at a large University with 200+ students in one lecture hall. I also really enjoy the quality of the professors. For such a small private liberal arts college the professors are A+ material, and they really care that you succeed. I also enjoy the diversity of the students because of the fact that many international students attend the College along with study abroad programs which brings a diverse group of people from countries all around the world to small Fulton, Missouri.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2018-03-29T00:47:00.08882Z","guid":"a0f037b6-6298-4cf4-a97c-8da5790d95b9","rating":4},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":3}],"photos":{"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-91.954345,38.847764,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-91.954345,38.847764,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.7729257641921397,"count":229},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Fulton, MO"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/westminster-college---missouri/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"f62bee41-92e0-48fc-9e57-2e5df171e519","content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"California State University - Fullerton","type":"College","url":"california-state-university---fullerton"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.4823},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":8170},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"920-1120"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Sophomore","body":"A lot of diversity! I commuted there from Los Angeles my first two semesters Monday - Friday. I have been meeting awesome individuals from different parts of the state. You get to really meet different kinds of personalities as well.  Most professors are friendly and can be easy to approach. On finals week, there are many resources for students to ease there stress such as \"puppy time\" where students can pet adorable puppies to clear their mind and bring one joy.  Although I have only been there for a year, I am enjoying the experience due to the self-growth I have been able to obtain. Like any college, the experience is up to the individual. You will most likely receive what you decide to make it as. The more you effectively invest in Cal State Fullerton, the more you will benefit from it.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2018-06-02T04:40:27.14261Z","guid":"4aaf0740-f500-4f4e-8095-457fb9754e83","rating":5},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":3.33}],"photos":{"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-117.885349,33.883627,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-117.885349,33.883627,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.6349315068493153,"count":4380},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Fullerton, CA"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/california-state-university---fullerton/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"3d1379fe-e2a4-41e7-b0dc-87a59efe31b5","content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"University of Southern Mississippi","type":"College","url":"university-of-southern-mississippi"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.6014},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":11916},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"940-1190"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Freshman","body":"University was an adjustment for me, but USM is amazing.

Another interesting thing about Quinnipiac is that it has many clubs and organizations available. In this way, each student can definitely find something that matches their hobbies and interests.

Class sizes are normally small enough that professors can talk to and interact with students on a one-on-one basis to answer questions, to provide assistance, to facilitate conversation, and to even assist with opportunities. With more than seventy individual majors and the opportunities to earn multiple majors, students definitely have not only variety but choice to maximize the opportunities afforded to them to achieve their dreams. The Office of Undergraduate Research has been instrumental in allowing students to travel, to present research, and network, and students are often more than prepared to attend graduate schools and to fill the vacant job and/or leadership positions available after college.

The faculty will be willing to present you with what kind of opportunities are available to you, but you have to be the one to pursue them and find out which one is right for you.\nYou also need to keep an eye on is your finances.

My visit included overnight lodging, meals, but most importantly inclusion in several classes I was interested in taking.  I decided this was the place I wanted to obtain my degree.  While I spent four semesters at community college, all of my credits transferred to Seton Hill.  My advisers have been very helpful in making decisions to class schedule and career choices.  This is an older campus with great atmosphere.  It was very to transition from community college to university.   I plan on obtaining an Art Education degree and am taking full advantage of a three year old arts building which contains not only art studios, but studios for dance.  I would strongly advise anybody to include Seton Hill University on their must see.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2018-02-22T21:44:17.985189Z","guid":"61726ed2-d54f-47da-97e7-856f49aca3d1","rating":4},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":3}],"photos":{"default":{"crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/b06026905218d3c3ca4053c9029856e9e622f6c7.jpg","MobileHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/b2dec240be13299f7548e035000b823cccb5ee7e.jpg"},"licenseName":"UNLICENSED"},"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-79.556228,40.308623,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-79.556228,40.308623,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.6678966789667897,"count":813},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Greensburg, PA"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/seton-hill-university/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"08e4512d-1b69-4961-b165-881c7fb2b953","content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":true,"isPremium":false,"name":"Indiana University of Pennsylvania","type":"College","url":"indiana-university-of-pennsylvania"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.9154},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":17264},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"840-1050"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Graduate Student","body":"The Indiana University of Pennsylvania (IUP) is a wonderful institution for higher education.  IUP has a strong network of professors from a variety of backgrounds and experiences, which allows for a multitude of learning opportunities.  The campus is absolutely stunning with its mixture of  up-to-date academic buildings, alongside historic buildings that have been standing since the incorporation of the university.  The university aims to have a very diverse community of faculty and students, which it successfully accomplishes through its various academic programs and events.  The university is nestled in the small city of Indiana, Pennsylvania.  There are plenty of restaurants, shops, and bars along Philadelphia Street to keep students entertained in the evenings and on the weekends.  Overall, I have received a quality education at IUP, and I would certainly recommend the university to others!","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2017-06-14T00:34:38.38611Z","guid":"216f6226-49ec-497e-86db-e5d5160ea815","rating":5},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":2.66}],"photos":{"default":{"crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/7c0a4013a571b3a4a1264b3cb67be13d334effcc.jpg","MobileHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/dbc91e581f5249282986d93e1f6cabd86c38fca7.jpg"},"licenseName":"UNLICENSED"},"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-79.159869,40.615589,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-79.159869,40.615589,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.479651162790698,"count":2408},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Indiana, PA"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/indiana-university-of-pennsylvania/#scatterplot"}}]}
