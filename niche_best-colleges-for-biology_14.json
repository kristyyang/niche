This year we had casino night,rock the rec, capture the flag and a glow in the dark paint party. Casino night was where we played black jack and poker. They also had a \"bar\" which consisted of virgin drinks. Rock the rec consisted of key logging, silent disco, glow in the dark dodgeball and rock climbing. We played capture the flag until 2am and last but not least, we had a huge rave paint party with an awesome DJ until close to midnight. \n\nClass wise, the classes aren't huge unlike UA or Auburn which is great for one on one time. My biggest class has 100 people in it and my smallest had around 20. It varies but still great class sizes. \n\nThe university of Alabama in Huntsville also offers FREE TUTORS!","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2017-09-09T14:32:58.677726Z","guid":"2f9373b5-71ee-49d9-b593-efc5e24c2233","rating":4},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":3.66}],"photos":{"default":{"crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/7ac6bae225c95ea161b599e812c6521aaa66b250.jpg","MobileHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/9714b0e200c1f8523104de5c4609e6ba53a82ac1.jpg"},"licenseName":"UNLICENSED"},"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-86.63842,34.722818,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-86.63842,34.722818,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.6296829971181555,"count":694},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Huntsville, AL"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/the-university-of-alabama-in-huntsville/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"23dfdc50-c6a3-42a5-b318-71186d894781","badge":{"display":"Best Colleges for Biology in America","ordinal":339,"total":954,"vanityURL":"best-colleges-for-biology"},"content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":true,"isPremium":false,"name":"Taylor University","type":"College","url":"taylor-university"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.7961},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":25429},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"950-1250"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Junior","body":"Taylor is a great Christian school focusing primarily of getting a Christian education in order to build up characteristics of servant leaders.

My favorite experiences so far have been the community events organized by the campus. The first week always consists of different activities and events everyday so that students can gather around the campus, get to know others, learn about clubs/activities, and get food and school themed clothes as well. My campus has a block party in Denver since it's right across the street where music and food is provided, along with tables and tents promoting all the clubs and organizations available on campus.

The academics are challenging and many employers see Stockton University as a highly credited institution to graduate from. I highly recommend any student looking for a college where they will easily fit in and belong.

The counselors are unworkable, slow, and useless. Nevertheless, the school and education itself are very good. In addition, I have enjoyed the student body at USU. They are humble, hardworking, and fun. Overall, I give Utah State University a four-star rating. They provide a great education for a reasonable price.

I met the counselor at a college fair & from there, we instantly clicked! She  followed up w/ emails, letters, interviews and super friendly greetings when I went to the open house. GREAT financial aid, always looking to improve. I heard the best parts about MCPHS are the massages, puppy visits during finals, etc. Also, this is a college where it's great to make friends quick being very diverse.

The location of Hunter is convenient; it is located in the city so your choices don't fall short when it comes to food. Hunter has a library on nine floors. My complaint is that when you attend Hunter no one tells you anything unless you ask many, many questions! I know several people who took the incorrect class for their major, wasting time and money. Additionally, I feel that in large lecture halls with more than 100 students, there isn't a chance to receive individualized attention.

It's so amazing and I cannot wait to see what is yet to come.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2017-09-27T17:21:27.045435Z","guid":"b7a635b0-e527-4b1d-9b7c-e8b12351d7f7","rating":5},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":3.33}],"photos":{"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-111.855553,40.731495,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-111.855553,40.731495,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.6926108374384237,"count":1015},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Salt Lake City, UT"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/westminster-college---utah/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"0e0173c0-d113-46b5-a20b-42841cf39f36","badge":{"display":"Best Colleges for Biology in America","ordinal":361,"total":954,"vanityURL":"best-colleges-for-biology"},"content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"Jefferson College of Health Sciences","type":"College","url":"jefferson-college-of-health-sciences"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.410609},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":23949},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"840-1060"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Junior","body":"My experience at JCHS has been great!
