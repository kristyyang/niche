Despite all of its flaws and imperfections, it is a safe space where I can explore and learn. The campus itself is a small city with features that make it feel more cozy than full-out sophisticated. From our beautiful Cathedral of Learning (we lovingly call her Cathy) to the spacious Schenley Park, there are tons of secret nooks that are perfect for studying. The professors, while teaching multiple classes, still make themselves available for questions outside the classroom. They are never too busy to stop and chat if you see them around campus; they really care about your education and that you have a passion for what you are studying. Overall, Pitt is an amazing college to attend. The community surrounding the campus challenge you and support you all at once.

There are tons of possibilities that one can get involved in at Penn State through clubs, community involvement, or sports.  As an engineer, I am very glad that I chose this particular school because our engineering department is one of the best in the United States, and the chances of finding a job upon graduation is quite high.  There is one particular thing that I would like to see change in the future at Penn State and that particular change is with academic scholarships for students.  Currently, Penn State only offers athletic scholarships at the main campus, and at branch campuses I was able to find out that they offer academic scholarships.  There are particular scholarships offered through individual colleges at main, but for someone is graduates in the top percentage of their class there should be some sort of scholarship given.  Overall, Penn State is a great school.

Even though I did not focus on the social life at Clemson when I first started, I quickly was able to find friends from all backgrounds, some being from various clubs and fraternities, to those on the football team.

The university is very diverse and accommodates for everyone. One of the best security feature they have are these emergency call booths where someone can press the emergency button and the campus police will be there under 90 seconds.

I felt I received a Mona Lisa Smile experience at the in-state tuition price! There was huge versatility of choice in majors and program-specific internship opportunities. Most of all, I was serviced with fantastic one-on-one advisor attention throughout my entire bachelor's course (4 years). Excellent free help labs (economics, accounting) and tutoring services.

Additionally, I loved that the students seemed to really care about their campus and that most students are extremely involved on campus. This was all clear to me during my tour and then when I sat in on a class, I was sold. The professor I had was engaging and made the rather large classroom (by Wooster's standards) seem much more intimate. I remember hearing students talking about the class and other classes before and after the lecture, which made me realize how engaged in academics students here are. Fast forward four years and here I am typing this review as a junior at the College.
