I've had an excellent experience so far and am thrilled that I chose this university. I love the small class sizes and the relationships that you are able to form with your professors. I also love the atmosphere of the school, and the fact that you can see people you know all the time. It's also great that you can always find a place to fit in. There's something for everyone if you seek it out. Additionally, I have been blessed with fantastic work and internship opportunities from this school, which are extremely valuable. However, athletics are not a huge priority for the school, which is slightly a bummer. I am an athlete at Chapman and I would definitely love to see more student support of athletics. What's great is that the student athletes and athletic directors have been very proactive about this. They are working hard to draw more support for all teams and make athletics more inclusive. Overall, Chapman is an excellent university and I am proud to be a student!","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2017-06-07T18:03:56.544528Z","guid":"601a0872-151f-456b-808d-39227c94c6dc","rating":4},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":3.66}],"photos":{"default":{"crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/f07e4f95104cdd5544640486d187493d525f8ebd.jpg","MobileHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/0152149fb7684443dadb5750fe110b118dcae5ab.jpg"},"licenseName":"UNLICENSED"},"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-117.853,33.7933,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-117.853,33.7933,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.6210840377921434,"count":2011},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Orange, CA"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/chapman-university/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"3602fc0f-fca6-4a42-8e3d-2ae888e5927f","badge":{"display":"Best Colleges in America","ordinal":637,"total":1644,"vanityURL":"best-colleges"},"content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"Texas A&M University - Commerce","type":"College","url":"texas-a-and-m-university---commerce"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.4614},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":9032},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"870-1080"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Freshman","body":"Commerce is a great place to attend college!

Many of the professors here have gone above and beyond to accommodate for any questions and concerns that I may have. Going to an out-of-state school is very nerve wracking at first, but I am glad that I picked Elon. Elon has become my home away from home in more ways than one and I often find myself counting down the days till I am back on campus. Elon's curriculum can be very intense at times; however, I am getting an education based on the work that I put in. One complaint that I have about Elon is paying for laundry. The cost adds up very quickly and is often frustrating that I have to pay so that I am able to wear clean clothes to class. However, that is the only negative that I have so it doesn't outweigh all of the positive things that Elon has to offer me.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2018-04-19T13:43:25.478388Z","guid":"7f30ce7a-7427-4e25-bd99-8dd8702c2318","rating":5},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":3.66}],"photos":{"default":{"crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/9594d06e83a657e2511ddfd70641a213c2851460.jpg","MobileHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/42f3524b81e18c8a4e7a393354dccf1b6a43db44.jpg"},"licenseName":"UNLICENSED"},"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-79.505632,36.104149,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-79.505632,36.104149,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.5380818053596617,"count":1418},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Elon, NC"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/elon-university/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"709c9868-25cf-40d4-b94e-b2420a0dbbc6","content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"Morehead State University","type":"College","url":"morehead-state-university"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.8556},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":11296},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"840-1060"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Freshman","body":"I really do love this college but there are some downfalls to the way things work.

Campus is very much together; you could walk to all of your classes. There's a shuttle bus that runs every 15-20 minutes that will take you around campus when you're feeling lazy or the weather is bad. The faculty members I've experienced the past 3 years I've been there have been AMAZING. I've met the most knowledgeable individuals at the Psychology Department. They are my favorite and most loved department at ESU! The dorms and housing are constantly improving which makes it hard to pick a hall to live in.

Which makes you feel very safe. The campus is small and beautiful and gives a home feeling like no other college I looked into. I am a commuter so I can not say what it is like living on campus.

I am absolutely sure that I did and I could not be happier to have chosen to attend Howard University.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2018-01-04T23:35:01.904982Z","guid":"f10182e7-25e8-4ab9-b6e1-755380fabb28","rating":5},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":3.33}],"photos":{"default":{"crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/7633545e449854b939174fafc89bf538b3ced8ce.jpg","MobileHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/48d8510e8210ca6e286bee501be568a49f82533e.jpg"},"licenseName":"UNLICENSED"},"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-77.019478,38.920739,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-77.019478,38.920739,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.3921120320091456,"count":3499},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Washington, DC"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/howard-university/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"d7a347a3-2d4a-4312-bff1-c0e26d828872","badge":{"display":"Best Colleges in America","ordinal":451,"total":1644,"vanityURL":"best-colleges"},"content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"Georgia College & State University","type":"College","url":"georgia-college--and--state-university"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.8452},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":19717},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"1030-1220"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Freshman","body":"My absolute favourite thing was how everyone was so friendly here! All the staff were very nice and helpful whenever I had any issues, which wasn't often in the first place because everyone was so helpful. Lots of my teachers seemed genuinely invested in how I was doing in their class and at GCSU in general.\nThe only thing I ever had an issue with was the mathematics department. Most teachers in that area did seem to care, but oftentimes I found they weren't able to teach the material quite as well as teachers in other areas. It would either be extremely difficult, with teachers going completely over my head, or very, very easy, with the teacher practically going back to basic high school math. It'd be nice to see some more focus on that area and to see it improve some.\nBut overall, this college has a very welcoming and warm environment and I'd recommend it to anyone looking for a good start to college. Just maybe don't come here if you want to be a math major.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2018-05-14T16:31:27.18293Z","guid":"b45e32d1-4501-4f01-a345-234a7cf1a0e9","rating":4},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":3.33}],"photos":{"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-83.231962,33.082787,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-83.231962,33.082787,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.6914529914529917,"count":1170},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Milledgeville, GA"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/georgia-college--and--state-university/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"aeea046f-f16a-4a0c-9fbc-ee76f994f6fc","content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":true,"isPremium":false,"name":"Shippensburg University of Pennsylvania","type":"College","url":"shippensburg-university-of-pennsylvania"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.8831},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":18342},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"870-1070"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Sophomore","body":"Shippensburg University is a wonderful university!

Cumulatively, however, I am very happy with my education and look forward to applying all I've learned in medical school next year!","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2018-05-19T02:56:35.123833Z","guid":"86825099-b16d-44cd-8acf-d0bd16ad15d1","rating":5},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":3.33}],"photos":{"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-117.88795,34.130865,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-117.88795,34.130865,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.721298495645289,"count":2526},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Azusa, CA"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/azusa-pacific-university/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"b9be9f9b-9415-49a6-990c-febf24814572","badge":{"display":"Best Colleges in America","ordinal":243,"total":1644,"vanityURL":"best-colleges"},"content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":true,"isPremium":false,"name":"The University of Alabama in Huntsville","type":"College","url":"the-university-of-alabama-in-huntsville"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.7628},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":14190},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"1060-1340"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Freshman","body":"The University of Alabama in Huntsville provides a lot of great opportunities for all students regardless of race or ethnicity. They offer trips and movie nights which is all free for admitted students.\n\nEvery year they have \"week of welcome\" which consists of a lot of events. This year we had casino night,rock the rec, capture the flag and a glow in the dark paint party. Casino night was where we played black jack and poker. They also had a \"bar\" which consisted of virgin drinks. Rock the rec consisted of key logging, silent disco, glow in the dark dodgeball and rock climbing. We played capture the flag until 2am and last but not least, we had a huge rave paint party with an awesome DJ until close to midnight. \n\nClass wise, the classes aren't huge unlike UA or Auburn which is great for one on one time. My biggest class has 100 people in it and my smallest had around 20. It varies but still great class sizes. \n\nThe university of Alabama in Huntsville also offers FREE TUTORS!","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2017-09-09T14:32:58.677726Z","guid":"2f9373b5-71ee-49d9-b593-efc5e24c2233","rating":4},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":3.66}],"photos":{"default":{"crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/7ac6bae225c95ea161b599e812c6521aaa66b250.jpg","MobileHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/9714b0e200c1f8523104de5c4609e6ba53a82ac1.jpg"},"licenseName":"UNLICENSED"},"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-86.63842,34.722818,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-86.63842,34.722818,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.6296829971181555,"count":694},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Huntsville, AL"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/the-university-of-alabama-in-huntsville/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"069fabab-5962-4292-85eb-780ddd735c82","badge":{"display":"Best Colleges in America","ordinal":6,"total":1644,"vanityURL":"best-colleges"},"content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"Princeton University","type":"College","url":"princeton-university"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.0652},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":17732},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"1400-1590"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Freshman","body":"As an entering student, I visited Princeton University in the middle of April. The campus is coated in blossoming trees, while the buildings are old yet renovated inside. The air is cool and moist, but not humid like southeast Texas.\n\nAnother thing I enjoy is the commitment to sustainability, especially in projects abroad and the dining hall food. The Princeton Environmental institute does classes with local farmers using a variety of methods and chefs from many culinary backgrounds.\n\nWhat I like most about Princeton is the community. My host and his friends had endless intellectual and personal discussions and readily invited me into their part of Princeton.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2018-04-23T23:02:51.480973Z","guid":"c54a3eae-4cbe-4e4e-ad93-03dfb8aff562","rating":5},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":4.33}],"photos":{"default":{"author":"jal33","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/2560fd4b6044a1d64d87f709238cb73aa93957ab.jpg","MobileHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/d7c980bcd685c0ba6da7438478031d28aa6603f5.jpg","Thumbnail":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/646c0aa45e7ecd12528654d08332cc99a20c651e"},"licenseName":"CC BY ","licenseUrl":"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/2.0/","sourceUrl":"https://www.flickr.com/photos/jal33/16215204421/"},"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-74.663708,40.348496,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-74.663708,40.348496,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.9037974683544303,"count":395},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Princeton, NJ"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/princeton-university/#scatterplot"}}]}
