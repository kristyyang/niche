I find that CSULA is very safety-conscious, maintains an excellent campus environment and student life, and hires very impressive and motivated professors who instill knowledge and their own passions into the students they teach. However, if there are two aspects that I would like to see CSULA improve on, they would be the local area and campus food. I would appreciate it if there were interesting activities to participate in in the local area and if there was a much bigger variety of healthy food choices aside from the food trucks and the food court.

Overall, I found this school to be a great value and would encourage prospective students to get as involved as possible to really see how much there is to offer.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2018-03-30T19:11:31.412394Z","guid":"a38cf4c6-c731-4099-993a-770bf43f20c5","rating":5},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":3.33}],"photos":{"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-86.172217,39.772948,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-86.172217,39.772948,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.573560131304088,"count":3351},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Indianapolis, IN"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/indiana-university-purdue-university---indianapolis-iupui/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"4662e8d2-30af-481f-b32d-bde25f1108f8","content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":true,"isPremium":false,"name":"University of Texas - Arlington","type":"College","url":"university-of-texas---arlington"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.6982},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":11952},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"950-1190"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Sophomore","body":"I am a single mother of 2 girls (9&7) and I am finally finishing my degree in want I want to do.

There is an abundance of student activities on campus; you can even watch as people prance across Fountain Mall playing a game of Quidditch. Day in and day out, there are a multitude of franchises to dine in or out at. In the \"Grease Pit\", on the opposite side of the high way lining campus, there are more fast-food restaurants than you could even count on all your fingers and toes. In addition to the campus life and eateries, Baylor is the only university also certified as a zoo. With the two live bears, Joy and Lady, the campus is lit up by their presence as true mascots. Overall, Baylor is a University that provides all who visit with an experience they can never forget.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2017-09-20T23:56:26.479527Z","guid":"d5d0fd60-eeed-4c65-946f-12b1204c8a4f","rating":5},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":4}],"photos":{"default":{"author":"idibri","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/2ffbeb044fb4d9170a13937957cb326174d59aa8.jpg","MobileHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/e93d522be30ba75eb00cbbde64288df09d2f9421.jpg","Thumbnail":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/65c27d7c0a6c701dc4d1560bd180cfb49d250372"},"licenseName":"CC BY ","licenseUrl":"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/2.0/","sourceUrl":"https://www.flickr.com/photos/idibri/15272187099/"},"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-97.119359,31.545956,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-97.119359,31.545956,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.702513604560767,"count":3859},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Waco, TX"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/baylor-university/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"3a9f619c-c041-4aba-a4c6-f789b057ee3f","content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"University of Akron","type":"College","url":"university-of-akron"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.9592},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":16568},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"910-1180"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Niche User","body":"I had great experiences at the University of Akron!

A lot of work is required, but I'm sure that goes for any university. There are students of all ages. The parking is TERRIBLE. The school has purchased all parking anywhere near the school and parking permits are needed everywhere. I tried to buy a parking permit but there were no more available. So I was forced to walk a mile to classes, and even still had to pay at parking meters. I didn't mind the walk, but sometimes could not find parking. Another thing I didn't appreciate is that there are no places where I could pump my breast milk, since I am a breastfeeding momma. I always had to pump in restrooms which seemed unsanitary and quite frankly stinky at times. My adviser has been great! She is very helpful. I really do like the school, these were just a few concerns of mine.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2018-06-06T17:53:20.55995Z","guid":"399fb7dd-8c08-4b3d-bb4a-1792d16e7a08","rating":4},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":3}],"photos":{"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-106.50356,31.771697,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-106.50356,31.771697,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.578669910786699,"count":2466},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"El Paso, TX"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/university-of-texas---el-paso/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"ae6adb6f-0375-4baa-9e19-ba05caac2fcf","content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"Bowling Green State University","type":"College","url":"bowling-green-state-university"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.7605},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":17313},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"900-1150"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Freshman","body":"I love Bowling Green State University!

I love our school's cadets as well!","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2018-01-02T23:19:15.596376Z","guid":"e492869e-8532-4bfa-bf56-b624e1b639e3","rating":5},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":2.66}],"photos":{"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-83.985934,34.530254,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-83.985934,34.530254,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.6371681415929205,"count":1582},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Dahlonega, GA"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/university-of-north-georgia/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"13158f4a-aeeb-44e0-9573-4fcdea72ba95","content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"University of Memphis","type":"College","url":"university-of-memphis"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.5668},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":13291},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"900-1160"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Sophomore","body":"I started at the University of Memphis a year ago after graduating from high school. It was a completely new experience of school, but the University of Memphis did a great job getting us comfortable and confident that we made the right choice. Most professors are great, I would just recommend checking their individual reviews and choosing the right one for you.

It is a large, beautiful campus, but the class sizes are relatively small. Even lecture halls have under 100 students. In my time at UNCW I grew close to many professors, and even was a TA. The only downfalls to this campus were parking and wifi. I had no other negative experiences. It is a fast growing school and I wish I didn't have to leave to go to grad school (they don't have physical therapy). In-state tuition is very reasonable, and I did not end up out of college drowning in debt. Overall, I would recommend uncw to anyone. Oh, and the rec center is one of the best parts- it is one of the largest and newest on the east coast!","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2018-06-03T03:04:34.826704Z","guid":"a6ec4462-cbae-44dc-b1c9-6c950a6425ff","rating":5},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":3.66}],"photos":{"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-77.875527,34.225223,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-77.875527,34.225223,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.685854255970606,"count":1633},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Wilmington, NC"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/university-of-north-carolina---wilmington/#scatterplot"}}]}
