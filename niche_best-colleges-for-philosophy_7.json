I’m a diversity student - part Samoan part Caucasian, gay, religious - and the way the university handles its diversity students is phenomnial! The organizations that I’ve benefitted the most from have been CESA (Center of Ethnic Students Association), specifically PISA (Polynesian Islanders Students Association) that is within CESA, and the school’s LGBT Resource Center. These two organizations - CESA and their LGBT Resource Center - have helped adjust to college life as a first year student. I feel right at home and I feel safe.\n\nMoreover, the faculty, at least in my experience, have always been supportive of diversity students and help accommodate them and their needs. I’ve many that talk openly and respectfully concerning lgbt issues, diversity issues, and they always end with their discussions inspiration and motivation to dream big and achieve our goals. \n\nIt’d be a dream if I could continue my education there.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2018-06-04T17:43:01.882008Z","guid":"1ffe6e36-cd4f-4fff-b11b-544c393955d0","rating":5},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":4}],"photos":{"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-111.846044,40.762484,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-111.846044,40.762484,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.7160945413618456,"count":3554},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Salt Lake City, UT"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/university-of-utah/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"7f16885e-49fd-4ded-8203-f30f5db7b2f7","content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"Central Michigan University","type":"College","url":"central-michigan-university"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.7156},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":14275},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"890-1140"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Alum","body":"CMU is a great school to attend if you're into a college that doesn't seem overwhelming.

They are definitely lacking in the social aspect and should coordinate more vibrant events.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2018-04-26T17:56:19.949051Z","guid":"98e81e06-7ce2-4632-a8e7-b9e4a199bc1d","rating":4},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":3.66}],"photos":{"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-87.651145,41.872651,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-87.651145,41.872651,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.5712780898876404,"count":2848},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Chicago, IL"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/university-of-illinois-at-chicago/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"caeeafb2-60f9-4e5a-99ea-c1b77df4bd6b","content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"California State University - San Bernardino","type":"College","url":"california-state-university---san-bernardino"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.5814},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":6444},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"780-980"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Sophomore","body":"This school is very diverse!

The buildings look great and the mostly glass designs give off an open, chic vibe. Webb University Center, or the Webb as we call it, has 5+ eateries, a video game lobby, pool tables, and it is home to many student activities. Unlike other schools, Old Dominion allows their freshman to enjoy their college experience. We have only 1-2 visitation rules, residents don't have a curfew, and dorms are co-ed. With all this freedom, the university still makes sure our work gets done. We are given free tutoring, study rooms on every floor of every dorm, and many educational centers. To relax from the stress of school, you could party near or on campus! Safe Ride (ODU's free transportation.) will take you anywhere that isn't beyond 38th street, which most parties aren't. As you can see ODU allows you to work hard and play hard too so come join us and become a monarch!","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2018-03-08T19:29:36.308387Z","guid":"0de9741a-c19c-412d-b0e9-84030928c78c","rating":5},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":3}],"photos":{"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-76.309653,36.884919,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-76.309653,36.884919,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.5399794976934906,"count":3902},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Norfolk, VA"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/old-dominion-university/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"62a9aa87-cfba-4885-b774-ef2a958e5cd8","content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"Missouri State University","type":"College","url":"missouri-state-university"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.8438},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":14862},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"955-1228"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Junior","body":"Missouri State University provides a plethora of opportunities to its students including recreational, pre-professional, and social activities.

There are many restaurants nearby. Also, there are bars and clubs nearby if you are interested in the night life! I am a freshman. So far, my instructors have taught well! A lot of work is required, but I'm sure that goes for any university. There are students of all ages. The parking is TERRIBLE. The school has purchased all parking anywhere near the school and parking permits are needed everywhere. I tried to buy a parking permit but there were no more available. So I was forced to walk a mile to classes, and even still had to pay at parking meters. I didn't mind the walk, but sometimes could not find parking. Another thing I didn't appreciate is that there are no places where I could pump my breast milk, since I am a breastfeeding momma. I always had to pump in restrooms which seemed unsanitary and quite frankly stinky at times. My adviser has been great! She is very helpful. I really do like the school, these were just a few concerns of mine.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2018-06-06T17:53:20.55995Z","guid":"399fb7dd-8c08-4b3d-bb4a-1792d16e7a08","rating":4},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":3}],"photos":{"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-106.50356,31.771697,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-106.50356,31.771697,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.578669910786699,"count":2466},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"El Paso, TX"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/university-of-texas---el-paso/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"26d015a7-badf-47b5-9641-2f2d2a3e9a10","content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":true,"isPremium":false,"name":"Drexel University","type":"College","url":"drexel-university"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.7465},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":39021},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"1080-1300"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Graduate Student","body":"DrexelU School of Nursing is an amazing program.

As a psychology major it is hard to get into classes you need as they close out, even if you came in with a ton of AP credits. Also, so many classes are big so its harder to focus and do well in them. The campus is hilly. Academics are great, i’ve only had one bad teacher. Advising sucks I had to figure everything out on my own. Mountainview dorms were awfull, invisible RA, no community events, unfriendly people etc. Now I live in Newing and I love it and it’s so much better! Many Long Island students, intentational students (mostly from Asia) and Jewish students. You have to find your people at this school but once you do your experience can be great. Also, we don’t have certain majors like education (also communications, and others people complain about) which really sucks but they try to sell you on their grad program. The food is hit or miss, definitely go to the Kosher station since they have the best food.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2018-05-23T01:30:53.174035Z","guid":"98f168b2-72e9-48d0-bb5e-1cc0fdef30f8","rating":4},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":3.66}],"photos":{"default":{"crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/843cc93be5f59a4bf97adb882d92fccaf932660b.jpg","MobileHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/e1bba7684cb59ca91b80ae5381f80c29566dec0c.jpg"},"licenseName":"UNLICENSED"},"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-75.971143,42.088049,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-75.971143,42.088049,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.5464154411764706,"count":2176},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Vestal, NY"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/binghamton-university-suny/#scatterplot"}}]}
