With FAMU comes great opportunities and long lasting friendships. The teachers show a lot of love and support, they don’t look at you as a number, they look at you as family helping family! One thing I would change about Famu is the rule of “Freshman’s not allowed to have cars” I believe that is unfair due to the fact that student students come from all over and a car is their only source of transportation to and from where they live. Allowing them to have a car for the first year would only give them the opportunity to get to and from home and also to and from a variety of attractions and destinations here in Tallahassee.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2017-11-23T05:57:34.467389Z","guid":"feda6c36-a053-4c8d-99d5-a0469e89b639","rating":4},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":3.33}],"photos":{"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-84.285664,30.428599,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-84.285664,30.428599,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.474764756201882,"count":2338},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Tallahassee, FL"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/florida-a-and-m-university/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"1efd3b32-c1ea-4216-b5f3-6b68b55c6728","content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"Morgan State University","type":"College","url":"morgan-state-university"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.603},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":15909},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"810-990"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Freshman","body":"Great school! The professors are awesome and really incorporate cultural competence into their lessons. There are always activities on campus to engage in and many clubs and fraternities and sororities. It is an open campus so there tends to be a lot of people that do not go to the school on campus and the food choices are very limited. On the plus side, the school is relatively inexpensive. I received various institutional  grants and scholarships without having to apply for them. Morgan is a great school for mature students as well and offers automatic admission for students who have continuously been out of school 3+ years which is always great.

The Princeton Environmental institute does classes with local farmers using a variety of methods and chefs from many culinary backgrounds.\n\nWhat I like most about Princeton is the community. My host and his friends had endless intellectual and personal discussions and readily invited me into their part of Princeton.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2018-04-23T23:02:51.480973Z","guid":"c54a3eae-4cbe-4e4e-ad93-03dfb8aff562","rating":5},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":4.33}],"photos":{"default":{"author":"jal33","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/2560fd4b6044a1d64d87f709238cb73aa93957ab.jpg","MobileHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/d7c980bcd685c0ba6da7438478031d28aa6603f5.jpg","Thumbnail":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/646c0aa45e7ecd12528654d08332cc99a20c651e"},"licenseName":"CC BY ","licenseUrl":"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/2.0/","sourceUrl":"https://www.flickr.com/photos/jal33/16215204421/"},"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-74.663708,40.348496,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-74.663708,40.348496,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.9037974683544303,"count":395},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Princeton, NJ"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/princeton-university/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"a1237f7c-3941-41ce-ba42-687c276b73b4","content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"Lehigh University","type":"College","url":"lehigh-university"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.26},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":27478},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"1230-1420"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Freshman","body":"The school offer excellent education and resources for students.

Its pass no record style of educating freshmen. There is no grading in the first semester. Instead, one gets \"Pass\" or \"Fail\" in his or her transcript. It allows students not to stress too much on grades, but explore the university and majors.\n3. Of course it is the best university in the field of chemical engineering.

The classes are wonderful and the professors are always helpful and caring. I feel challenged but not completely overwhelmed, even while competing as a student-athlete. The food here is good enough for dorm food. As long as you don't expect gourmet meals, you should be fine. Smith tries very hard to cater to vegan/vegetarians/allergies, but they could do more, especially for gluten allergies. Because I am so busy, I am not much of a partier, so it's a positive for me that Smith is not a party school. From what I have heard, the parties are very tame here, which is not for everyone! \nNorthampton is a cute little town that has just enough to keep me from being bored. The only downside is that the stores and restaurants are all quite expensive.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2017-10-25T13:28:31.461474Z","guid":"cb938965-a581-4e64-ad7f-be85365cb890","rating":5},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":4.33}],"photos":{"default":{"author":"redjar","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/c44d3254a840702e801402bd636d49e55441d51d.jpg","MobileHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/73ccf5c0dfdddaa61d9a8f1d81fdd4596457c0b3.jpg","Thumbnail":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/2d22a0ed441c82d8648f042e0ab772eedaccec5a"},"licenseName":"CC BY-SA","licenseUrl":"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/","sourceUrl":"https://www.flickr.com/photos/redjar/112893078/"},"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-72.638094,42.317933,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-72.638094,42.317933,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.6840236686390533,"count":845},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Northampton, MA"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/smith-college/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"c064c235-6c23-4089-a57e-c2d31d9d6621","content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"Norwich University","type":"College","url":"norwich-university"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.6998},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":28242},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"930-1160"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Freshman","body":"Small university where you know almost everybody.

This school is absolutely great!","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2017-01-12T02:16:56.877115Z","guid":"d4e828a4-f18e-4101-9726-84384b3bdb1c","rating":5},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":3.33}],"photos":{"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-86.355149,41.963266,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-86.355149,41.963266,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.3194748358862145,"count":457},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Berrien Springs, MI"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/andrews-university/#scatterplot"}}]}
