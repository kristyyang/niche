The professors are friendly and helpful.  There are an abundant amount of resources on campus, as well as, many places to get food.  There are a lot of things to keep a student busy on campus.  The gym is a great place to burn energy; there is even a pool, hot tub, and sauna!

When I visited campus for the first time, I knew this was the college I was going to be deciding on. The size of campus is perfect for a student who has always been in a small high school. Campus is very much together; you could walk to all of your classes. There's a shuttle bus that runs every 15-20 minutes that will take you around campus when you're feeling lazy or the weather is bad. The faculty members I've experienced the past 3 years I've been there have been AMAZING. I've met the most knowledgeable individuals at the Psychology Department. They are my favorite and most loved department at ESU! The dorms and housing are constantly improving which makes it hard to pick a hall to live in.

As recently reported on the news, my community has recently undergone a traumatic occurrence at the local mall ten minutes away. Eight people were stabbed, none of which were students at the university, and the assailant was killed on site. Since this, the community has really come together to work through this difficult time. Within the past few days, the school has offered many opportunities for gatherings in which students and faculty could find some light in this time of darkness. The school genuinely cares.

I had so much fun and connected with others they were extremely welcoming, I feel at home when I’m at Delaware State University. DSU has truly been my dream school. I’ve gotten offered to other schools all over the world but my first option is Delaware State and I know that’s where I’m meant to be after high school. I’m excited and eager to be a hornet and to be going from class to class on DSU campus!","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2017-12-11T23:24:03.418402Z","guid":"38b09cb4-2081-4a70-8c4f-7d0527c42dba","rating":5},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":2.66}],"photos":{"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-75.54053,39.187173,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-75.54053,39.187173,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.2883597883597884,"count":1134},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Dover, DE"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/delaware-state-university/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"1eb2ecf6-73b2-402e-b16f-de8d65a0d1f6","content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"Tabor College","type":"College","url":"tabor-college"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.5594},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":22420},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"830-1010"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Sophomore","body":"It feels like home.

Going to Oakwood was the best decision I could have made for my education. The campus is full of love, diversity, excitement, and Black Excellence.
