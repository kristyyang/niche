I feel like it really is possible to do whatever makes you happy without being judged. I'm not the typical sorority girl at all, but I am in a sorority here. I also do theatre, and these don't conflict at all! The sojourner truth library is pretty much my second home at this point considering how much time I spend there. The campus is incredibly beautiful and I find myself amazed at it every day.The classrooms are well kept and the professors are all incredible. The work load is rigorous but definitely manageable. The food is not always the best, but after your freshman year when you change your meal plan it gets significantly better. The night life isn't dead as some other posts said, you just have to know of what's going on! There's always either a frat party or a house show going on! On that note, you could also probably get into p&gs bar using a Pokémon card.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2017-12-24T06:19:45.813179Z","guid":"e8c3ad47-85d9-41c9-811e-51da017d5f4f","rating":5},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":3}],"photos":{"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-74.088727,41.737205,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-74.088727,41.737205,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.6121970289288505,"count":1279},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"New Paltz, NY"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/suny-new-paltz/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"6504f1ee-d47c-44e5-a611-cf344b3effb9","badge":{"display":"Best Colleges for Art in America","ordinal":125,"total":441,"vanityURL":"best-colleges-for-art"},"content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"Lewis & Clark College","type":"College","url":"lewis--and--clark-college"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.5495},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":35849},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"1190-1370"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Senior","body":"The most obvious advantage about attending Lewis & Clark is that you get to learn and spend time on a gorgeous campus!

The professors truly care about helping you, and always there to talk to you and help you in any way, even when it's not their office hours. The food options on campus and around the town of Boone are amazing. Most things are locally grown and harvested, with plenty of Vegan/Vegetarian and gluten free/allergy free options. The atmosphere on campus and through out the whole community is one of adventure and excitement. The students really enjoy getting outside and getting active. The Blue Ridge Parkway has some of the best views in the United States, but I may be a little biased!

It is not a typical college campus with brick buildings and grassy fields. It's nestled in the city of Richmond where you have a diverse and dynamic mix of students, city dwellers, artists, and everything you can imagine! I would never trade this for another \"typical\" school. In terms of academics, everything is accessible through student tutoring sessions, group review sessions (highly advisable). It's challenging (especially if you do the Honors College), but worth your while. THe study abroad programs are EXCELLENT. I did 2 of them myself, and definitely recommend it-- they find a way to finance whatever study abroad you want to do, through their scholarship office. \nI only take 1 star away because I was a commuter and did not enjoy VCU as much as the residential students. However, the commute is also highly doable and there is a lot of parking available to students. Honestly, VCU is the way to go.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2018-05-01T08:37:43.300365Z","guid":"f71873d8-b412-454c-be0c-5f8da8fc5baa","rating":4},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":3.33}],"photos":{"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-77.453597,37.547631,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-77.453597,37.547631,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.6626812515899263,"count":3931},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Richmond, VA"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/virginia-commonwealth-university/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"1614aa44-01e2-4ffe-8b2b-c614b1fc2fe9","badge":{"display":"Best Colleges for Art in America","ordinal":134,"total":441,"vanityURL":"best-colleges-for-art"},"content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"Lesley University","type":"College","url":"lesley-university"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.6373},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":29276},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"960-1160"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Freshman","body":"The things I love most about Lesley is that the students are creative, accepting, empowered, and open-minded.

The location of Hunter is convenient; it is located in the city so your choices don't fall short when it comes to food. Hunter has a library on nine floors. My complaint is that when you attend Hunter no one tells you anything unless you ask many, many questions! I know several people who took the incorrect class for their major, wasting time and money. Additionally, I feel that in large lecture halls with more than 100 students, there isn't a chance to receive individualized attention. The classroom size should be smaller so professors can focus on every students' needs and struggles.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2018-01-16T22:01:16.773582Z","guid":"61dee6aa-64ee-4526-9449-0dd06859694f","rating":4},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":3}],"photos":{"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-73.964795,40.768669,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-73.964795,40.768669,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.439636752136752,"count":1872},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"New York, NY"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/cuny-hunter-college/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"887d7ed7-3a0a-429e-9cfd-96147fa5eb79","badge":{"display":"Best Colleges for Art in America","ordinal":136,"total":441,"vanityURL":"best-colleges-for-art"},"content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"University of Arkansas","type":"College","url":"university-of-arkansas"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.632},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":15411},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"1010-1220"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Freshman","body":"Life at the U of A is a dream! #1, Ben Rector went here and throws us free concerts!

My greatest disappointment with ACU lies with its recently announced policy regarding LGBT student employees as its discriminating and distasteful rhetoric doesn't reflect the actual opinion of the campus population (my engagement with professors, staff, and students and observance of the collective outrage over the policy has confirmed as much for me). As an LGBT student who had an active role in multiple campus positions, it was greatly disappointing to learn the administration's recent decision.

The university is very diverse and accommodates for everyone. One of the best security feature they have are these emergency call booths where someone can press the emergency button and the campus police will be there under 90 seconds.

The campus is small and well kept, and the food is decent (for being college cafeteria food). The housing is not exactly state of the art, but it is safe and well-kept. The classes are small, allowing for more personalized attention from professors. The campus is very involved, with plenty of groups and activities for all types of people. While being a non-denominational Christian college that requires some religious courses, the faculty and staff do not ostracize or penalize anyone for choosing another path in life. The only downsides to the college are the location (Kansas has little to do, and small town Kansas has less) and the cost. The private school is fairly expensive to attend. However, all things considered, it is definitely a worthwhile college to look into as an upcoming freshman in college.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2017-05-31T00:55:00.195287Z","guid":"6740e85b-57b2-474c-93c3-84fc02af5020","rating":4},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":2.66}],"photos":{"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-98.209966,38.219783,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-98.209966,38.219783,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.488262910798122,"count":213},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Sterling, KS"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/sterling-college---kansas/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"b044a020-3b20-468f-88ae-2a9d23c07b53","badge":{"display":"Best Colleges for Art in America","ordinal":145,"total":441,"vanityURL":"best-colleges-for-art"},"content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"Cornell College","type":"College","url":"cornell-college"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.7094},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":27915},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"970-1275"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Sophomore","body":"Cornell College is my second home.

Professors vary from each other; since the university is a research university (and they take pride over that), your professors will vary from individual to individual. It's not surprising if your professor is super smart but horrible in teaching. You really have to fight for yourself here in studying, but that's not saying there aren't good Professors at all - there are! Emphasis on Professors because sometimes that's just what'll make or break your happiness for that quarter or so.\n\nThat being said, it's also not surprising to question your tuition here if it's worth it or not. UCI is a great place for connections, and if you learn well here and you connect well, then the money you put in here is pretty worth.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2018-02-13T03:59:18.054987Z","guid":"6eb5aef0-08a6-40f7-b76f-fef9e86e3c86","rating":4},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":4}],"photos":{"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-117.841248,33.648434,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-117.841248,33.648434,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.634504608294931,"count":3472},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Irvine, CA"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/university-of-california---irvine/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"768ce7e1-ce27-4258-b2dc-0b6f339427f7","badge":{"display":"Best Colleges for Art in America","ordinal":149,"total":441,"vanityURL":"best-colleges-for-art"},"content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":true,"isPremium":false,"name":"Seton Hill University","type":"College","url":"seton-hill-university"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.6087},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":23228},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"900-1150"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Junior","body":"I visited Seton Hill University during my high school senior year.  My visit included overnight lodging, meals, but most importantly inclusion in several classes I was interested in taking.  I decided this was the place I wanted to obtain my degree.  While I spent four semesters at community college, all of my credits transferred to Seton Hill.  My advisers have been very helpful in making decisions to class schedule and career choices.  This is an older campus with great atmosphere.  It was very to transition from community college to university.   I plan on obtaining an Art Education degree and am taking full advantage of a three year old arts building which contains not only art studios, but studios for dance.  I would strongly advise anybody to include Seton Hill University on their must see.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2018-02-22T21:44:17.985189Z","guid":"61726ed2-d54f-47da-97e7-856f49aca3d1","rating":4},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":3}],"photos":{"default":{"crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/b06026905218d3c3ca4053c9029856e9e622f6c7.jpg","MobileHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/b2dec240be13299f7548e035000b823cccb5ee7e.jpg"},"licenseName":"UNLICENSED"},"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-79.556228,40.308623,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-79.556228,40.308623,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.6678966789667897,"count":813},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Greensburg, PA"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/seton-hill-university/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"82187256-b1f8-43c2-868b-0f483850a03b","badge":{"display":"Best Colleges for Art in America","ordinal":150,"total":441,"vanityURL":"best-colleges-for-art"},"content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":true,"isPremium":true,"name":"Sierra Nevada College","type":"College","url":"sierra-nevada-college"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.5147},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":26370},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"850-1050"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Alum","body":"Transferring to Sierra Nevada College was the best decision I've ever made.
