Academics are outstanding. Classes are interesting and challenging, the professors are brilliant and accessible. Both semesters I got the classes I wanted, though sometimes your have to sit in for a first few days before getting in. (Common at liberal arts schools.) \n\nOberlin is a great size, small enough to feel like a community but large enough to keep meeting new people. Students are friendly. Some are quirky, athletic, political, or musical, but they are a great mix and you may be surprised at the friendships you make. There is always something to do on campus, and it is easy to get to Cleveland if you miss urban life. \n\nAthletics continue to improve, with several conference championships. Conservatory concerts are popular. The dining hall food is average, but if you like to cook or have dietary restrictions, you should consider joining a fun and delicious dining co-op.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2018-03-06T05:22:03.072255Z","guid":"7b628b94-f7f3-4fed-927e-71543287c20f","rating":5},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":4}],"photos":{"default":{"author":"sequencia","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/232068422ae94e1bf42cd7daf06f137ed8897c7c.jpg","MobileHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/305240c02b5d6f7eada3de2bf5ac141e00fe748c.jpg","Thumbnail":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/86f61778585249c0d5be198d4715b19b5a2d9a85"},"licenseName":"CC BY ","licenseUrl":"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/2.0/","sourceUrl":"https://www.flickr.com/photos/sequencia/567841903/"},"mapbox_header":{"author":"Â© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-82.221786,41.29474,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-82.221786,41.29474,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"Â© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.6582064297800336,"count":591},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Oberlin, OH"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/oberlin-college/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"94a3b32f-7213-4ea2-bc3a-5aa612b3850c","badge":{"display":"Best Colleges for English in America","ordinal":53,"total":647,"vanityURL":"best-colleges-for-english"},"content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"University of Richmond","type":"College","url":"university-of-richmond"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.3248},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":22400},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"1220-1420"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Freshman","body":"Everything is pretty awesome here.

Smith tries very hard to cater to vegan/vegetarians/allergies, but they could do more, especially for gluten allergies. Because I am so busy, I am not much of a partier, so it's a positive for me that Smith is not a party school.

I love the student body, I find the campus gorgeous, and I consider Williamsburg to be a wonderfully unique college town. I'm also very much fascinated by all the history on and off campus, and love to build up my own reserve of fast facts about the campus. I have been blown away by the push to promote positive mental health at the school this past year, and I am excited to see what the future holds for the college. If you're considering applying here, I encourage you to come and see it in person. I fell in love with the school while on a walking tour a few summers back, and I hope you can as well.

Find a place that feels like home, because it will become just that.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2018-05-07T20:21:56.171857Z","guid":"4c6fac8a-21e0-47b7-af85-cf5201a28535","rating":5},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":4.33}],"photos":{"default":{"crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/e392de297d5c0217fa9163e34be17ba2dbb7a3c5.jpg","MobileHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/beb6eae11f106ef55eec6ee45c4cf304a6650c00.jpg","Thumbnail":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/3498b09544f1ae199377093a18adba8c7514853e"},"licenseName":"UNLICENSED"},"mapbox_header":{"author":"Â© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-76.709395,37.27195,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-76.709395,37.27195,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"Â© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.572655690765927,"count":1397},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Williamsburg, VA"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/college-of-william--and--mary/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"4f186de4-b8ba-4895-981e-cce08c5a0c50","badge":{"display":"Best Colleges for English in America","ordinal":57,"total":647,"vanityURL":"best-colleges-for-english"},"content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"Mount Holyoke College","type":"College","url":"mount-holyoke-college"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.5219},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":27234},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"1220-1490"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Sophomore","body":"Mount Holyoke College is a lovely, accepting institution.

My only suggestion is that they make good on their promise of being a liberal and progressive institution by becoming a sanctuary campus and divesting from fossil fuels.

Now as an alumni, I would like to see Wake Forest put a little more effort into promoting career planning and skills for all majors and especially those in STEM subjects that might not know what the possibilities are.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2018-05-12T15:49:59.285747Z","guid":"b5278eb6-4889-4cf3-ba08-3e32c2f7566d","rating":4},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":4.33}],"photos":{"default":{"author":"86103678@N05","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/0d3809106b922bd8a27261cf03434fd8ac52c401.jpg","MobileHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/d1912cbf393cbe794f496da5108c3f647cddf14d.jpg","Thumbnail":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/3833938e6620eefa3bb03fe47043f27e321e9eb7"},"licenseName":"CC BY ","licenseUrl":"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/2.0/","sourceUrl":"https://www.flickr.com/photos/86103678@N05/19783500913/"},"mapbox_header":{"author":"Â© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-80.279004,36.135301,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-80.279004,36.135301,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"Â© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.664,"count":750},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Winston-Salem, NC"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/wake-forest-university/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"39a0f4a6-18de-4e61-8ef0-de48903d8b78","badge":{"display":"Best Colleges for English in America","ordinal":64,"total":647,"vanityURL":"best-colleges-for-english"},"content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"Lafayette College","type":"College","url":"lafayette-college"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.2829},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":26208},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"1200-1390"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Senior","body":"Lafayette College is a small community with a small town atmosphere.

Professors are incredible and very easy to access outside of class.  There are also so many extracurricular activities to participate in, and if something you want is not there, it is very easy to start your own club!  The campus dining services are incredible.  Dhall is life and I would be so lost without Spa and Burgess.  Dorms and on-campus apartments are spacious and have everything you could possibly need!

The building's collegiate gothic architectural style is beautiful and well maintained. The food there was wonderful, the campus cafeteria put meticulous effort into preparing each meal. The academic side of university of the south is where they excel. The former graduates of the university are well educated and prepared for their career field. The athletics are less than satisfactory however; because the university is so goal oriented towards educating students. Partying at the university is not great because the students are less focused on social affairs. Overall The University of the South is a perfect place to go to college if your goal and life are built around education. I personally love this school, but if you are the sort of person who enjoys less of the scholar side I would not recommend it to you.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2016-09-28T23:50:25.349506Z","guid":"d0f39dfb-ab1e-4944-8b84-db9b302cc862","rating":4},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":4}],"photos":{"mapbox_header":{"author":"Â© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-85.917772,35.20443,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-85.917772,35.20443,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"Â© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.650990099009901,"count":404},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Sewanee, TN"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/sewanee---the-university-of-the-south/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"bc90e2b6-e112-43ed-ac5c-3548829ea3dd","badge":{"display":"Best Colleges for English in America","ordinal":69,"total":647,"vanityURL":"best-colleges-for-english"},"content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"University of Texas - Austin","type":"College","url":"university-of-texas---austin"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.4037},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":16010},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"1140-1410"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Junior","body":"In one sentence:there.is.something.for.everyone!

For instance, I am a double major in Government and International Relations and Global Studies and am continuously amazed at the amount of programs, events, lectures , courses, and books available just for students in those majors. Your college's department of Career Services will blow you away as well, they will provide any and all resources to ensure your success after graduation.

It has excellent faculty who are committed to seeing their students realize their fullest potential and succeed in whatever they are passionate in. Great facilities, beautiful campus, great location, excellent weather year-round. I have formed lifelong friendships and gained great faculty and professional mentors and I am proud to call myself an alum there. Thanks to Oxy, I was able to get connected to many great opportunities such as study abroad, and now I am a Fulbright grantee. It is definitely a very liberal campus so may be difficult for conservative students but this climate definitely challenges conservative students to clearly think through their opinions and convictions, ultimately molding everyone to be a more careful thinker, more articulate speaker and writer, and better global citizen.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2018-02-23T13:41:41.112665Z","guid":"887a2db1-f1aa-4ddd-b666-7a87fd8bcae3","rating":5},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":4}],"photos":{"default":{"crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/23de020ed1f1e711fce623b93d51658fd31845ef.jpg","MobileHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/ae7e258edc46e9db455df5d463c1be2ae7c17d43.jpg","Thumbnail":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/be9a22e0a8a992cf1aec55766e9178fe18c527dc"},"licenseName":"UNLICENSED"},"mapbox_header":{"author":"Â© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-118.210783,34.126224,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-118.210783,34.126224,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"Â© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.6056338028169015,"count":426},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Los Angeles, CA"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/occidental-college/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"f56abd54-4c72-4706-aa60-b7b2db1435b1","badge":{"display":"Best Colleges for English in America","ordinal":72,"total":647,"vanityURL":"best-colleges-for-english"},"content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"University of California - Santa Barbara","type":"College","url":"university-of-california---santa-barbara"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.3577},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":15149},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"1120-1390"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Alum","body":"I had a great experience attending UCSB!
