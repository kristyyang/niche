UT Austin is simply the best in making a large school feeling immediately smaller by the countless communities you can jump right into. From political to adventurous student organizations, to meeting the very brightest professors and students in your chosen field, you will never cease to be amazed by the unlimited amount of opportunities available to you. For instance, I am a double major in Government and International Relations and Global Studies and am continuously amazed at the amount of programs, events, lectures , courses, and books available just for students in those majors. Your college's department of Career Services will blow you away as well, they will provide any and all resources to ensure your success after graduation. Most of all, UT is a highly respected university in the state of Texas and beyond, a degree from UT will go a very long way!

The amount of school spirit everyone has is unlike anything I've ever experienced and everyone truly is just so happy to be a buckeye. The challenging coursework and excellent professors make Ohio State's academic experience one of a kind. My only complaint about my is experience is, my dorm is very old and lacks air conditioning and study spaces. But after the weather cools down it's not a problem!

Football season is great, really brings the city together, especially fresh off of an Orange Bowl win. It took some adjusting living away from my family, but I've made some great friends in Madison. I had a great roommate freshman year and have gotten involved in several clubs--cheese club, Badger Cru, Sconnie Sports Talk to name a few. One thing I would look to change is the emphasis that is placed on tests--I know it's unlikely to be changed, I just think it's tough for people, especially those who are bad test-takers, to have one test be 50% of their grade. Other than that, these two years have been great--go Badgers!","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2018-04-25T22:29:44.54926Z","guid":"701ee4ec-29d7-454d-8536-f1bf5f2334d5","rating":5},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":4.33}],"photos":{"default":{"crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/20f1bba0ea57723355da0460ab2bb9bcc14af618.jpg","MobileHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/930fd63b8058ceaab63b92570be1f8f8353fd793.jpg","Thumbnail":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/deb1b7c312c971a2585ad9424fb8ccbe1726b4ec"},"licenseName":"UNLICENSED"},"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-89.405356,43.073858,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-89.405356,43.073858,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.8197674418604652,"count":2924},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Madison, WI"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/university-of-wisconsin/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"2903a6b2-8158-4848-8d1a-81ebdbba393c","badge":{"display":"Best Colleges for Accounting and Finance in America","ordinal":26,"total":652,"vanityURL":"best-colleges-for-accounting"},"content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"Penn State","type":"College","url":"penn-state"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.564},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":25055},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"1090-1300"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Sophomore","body":"Penn State is an amazing campus with a multitude of career paths to choose from.  There are tons of possibilities that one can get involved in at Penn State through clubs, community involvement, or sports.  As an engineer, I am very glad that I chose this particular school because our engineering department is one of the best in the United States, and the chances of finding a job upon graduation is quite high.  There is one particular thing that I would like to see change in the future at Penn State and that particular change is with academic scholarships for students.  Currently, Penn State only offers athletic scholarships at the main campus, and at branch campuses I was able to find out that they offer academic scholarships.  There are particular scholarships offered through individual colleges at main, but for someone is graduates in the top percentage of their class there should be some sort of scholarship given.

You will never be bored at the University of Minnesota as there is always something to do, whether that be exploring downtown, going to a concert, or kayaking on one of Minnesota's thousands of lakes.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2017-10-10T01:22:58.68552Z","guid":"ee4e1265-007e-4b96-9886-ae39d69a5325","rating":5},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":4.33}],"photos":{"default":{"crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/7c47197b6c681420e1ff9d02ca34965497f26980.jpg","MobileHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/ef6340f29dc14c077821ffa24b79426fbb40b939.jpg","Thumbnail":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/4a49146903513d434ea8f272942e8a4bbc35b374"},"licenseName":"UNLICENSED"},"mapbox_header":{"crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-93.235352,44.977886,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-93.235352,44.977886,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"UNLICENSED"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.671489149413819,"count":4009},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Minneapolis, MN"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/university-of-minnesota---twin-cities/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"ac9cfdaf-b7c0-44c8-931b-af5caa160f52","badge":{"display":"Best Colleges for Accounting and Finance in America","ordinal":38,"total":652,"vanityURL":"best-colleges-for-accounting"},"content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"Texas A&M University","type":"College","url":"texas-a-and-m-university"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.6717},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":15455},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"1070-1310"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Senior","body":"This is a large school, however it feels small.

The bus system used to transport students from one campus to another is unfortunately sub-par. The drivers take frequent and long breaks, which inconveniences students trying to get to class. A majority of buses themselves don't seem to be well maintained, either, and the bus schedule is unreliable. The quality and variety of the dining hall food is OK, depending on which you go to.

They place a lot of emphasis on academic growth and career success, and many students are offered generous scholarships during their undergrad. If money is a concern for you, I would strongly consider applying and seeing what scholarships you earn, because that was the deciding factor for me when I was in high school. Social life is lacking a bit but improving overall. It's important to get yourself out there and get involved in organizations, people I know in Greek life have also really enjoyed their experience. UTD is fairly close to Dallas and has a modern-type campus with many new buildings recently built. Campus food is excellent now with many options, there is also a full Starbucks store on campus. \n\nOverall, UTD is actually a great school that focuses on academics but has also improved in many other areas recently.

From our beautiful Cathedral of Learning (we lovingly call her Cathy) to the spacious Schenley Park, there are tons of secret nooks that are perfect for studying. The professors, while teaching multiple classes, still make themselves available for questions outside the classroom. They are never too busy to stop and chat if you see them around campus; they really care about your education and that you have a passion for what you are studying.

It is very diverse with people from all around the world. The professors are very helpful and there is a common theme of \"the mission to education\" where every person is working with another to improve the educational experience for everyone. \nAlthough having large classes might be an advantage for some people, it minimizes the interaction between the students, which could be improved. Students don't interact very well in classes and rely on extracurricular activities or living on campus to get to know more people. Additionally, another area where the university can improve is the campus food!
