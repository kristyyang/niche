Overall, I look forward to completing my undergrad program there.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2017-08-03T17:14:34.915027Z","guid":"bea16659-45f8-428b-a6ae-82c86492bcf1","rating":4},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":2.66}],"photos":{"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-86.89523,41.583788,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-86.89523,41.583788,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.4205128205128204,"count":390},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Westville, IN"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/purdue-university-northwest---north-central/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"3f492c07-a790-434c-b628-46a735bcc8e1","content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"Indiana University - Kokomo","type":"College","url":"indiana-university---kokomo"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.6913},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":8718},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"830-1030"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Freshman","body":"Overall, my experience at Indiana University Kokomo has been a learning experience. I feel welcomed on campus, but not included. It is admirable to see how the instructors and professors reach out to students to let them know they are available to help. Nonetheless, when walking from building to building and up and down the halls of the many buildings on campus I am once again reminded I'm here for an education. The environment makes one feel like it is not for socializing, perhaps small talk, but foremost to succeed in everything. I've considered transferring to another four year institution, but then I'm reminded if I want the best environment to study it would IUK. Where else could I find a campus where I feel safe whether I come really early,  have the opportunity to talk one on one with my professor and grow a relationship to have great recommendations, and many opportunities due to the number of \nstudents on campus.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2017-12-28T23:48:21.73246Z","guid":"d3471b18-e997-4eb7-8d6a-b49197034d7f","rating":4},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":2.66}],"photos":{"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-86.132096,40.459913,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-86.132096,40.459913,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.6496350364963503,"count":411},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Kokomo, IN"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/indiana-university---kokomo/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"7142f38c-9d62-4173-9c4d-dc2da081a40f","badge":{"display":"Best Colleges in America","ordinal":450,"total":1644,"vanityURL":"best-colleges"},"content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"Fresno Pacific University","type":"College","url":"fresno-pacific-university"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.6848},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":18245},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"850-1060"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Junior","body":"I love the community and atmosphere on the main campus.

You do not have to be a Christian to attend this university as there is no statement of faith paper which needs to be documented. They are welcoming of all backgrounds and beliefs. Our athletics are also amazing. I especially like the swimming & diving and volleyball team. They are both so fun to cheer on!

It is a beautiful little campus that is nice and peaceful, and you get to meet a lot of new and wonderful people.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2017-01-28T06:14:47.121493Z","guid":"fc794952-c206-47fb-b55c-7c9fc9c05309","rating":5},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":3}],"photos":{"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-82.37026,35.069758,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-82.37026,35.069758,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.6914498141263943,"count":538},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Tigerville, SC"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/north-greenville-university/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"288a84cb-18f4-424d-a372-8ff0c7955506","content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"Governors State University","type":"College","url":"governors-state-university"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.413},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":16143},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"855-1070"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Junior","body":"I'm a transfer student into GSU. The academics and professors are great here! The campus is a bit of a maze, but there is always someone around to help you find where you need to be and there are signs everywhere helping you figure out where you are. The athletic program is currently growing, so the school doesn't offer many sports yet but is in the process of adding more and expanding its current programs. There are always events going on through different clubs and organizations on campus. GSU has a diverse population of students in terms of race, religion, and age. Many students are commuters and transfer students because GSU only started accepting freshmen a few years ago.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2018-01-10T23:17:58.674054Z","guid":"5f9a786a-5023-4364-a2d7-07bfa40d8832","rating":4},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade"}],"photos":{"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-87.717012,41.448603,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-87.717012,41.448603,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.3585526315789473,"count":304},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"University Park, IL"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/governors-state-university/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"522b0cb1-dc74-4a5d-bc81-0f45b09544d0","content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":true,"isPremium":false,"name":"Mansfield University of Pennsylvania","type":"College","url":"mansfield-university-of-pennsylvania"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.8752},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":17080},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"860-1060"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Freshman","body":"Manfield University is not just a place to further my education, it is another home.
