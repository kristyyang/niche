As a graduate student, the class size is small which provides more opportunities to engage in class lecture and speak with the professor. The professors are well-educated and knowledgeable about the course material. The classrooms are small but equipped with everything you need. The campus is safe with security guards standing by. You must pay for parking, but there is meter parking near by that works well for graduate students with class in the evenings. But as an undergrad, parking could be an issue. The area is also infested with older, homeless people that can sometimes get awkward, but I've never felt unsafe.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2017-09-30T19:25:10.518202Z","guid":"ae84213a-b185-4958-aa95-645761dab625","rating":4},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":2.66}],"photos":{"default":{"crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/de3476c25d3f81d7e72199c800e9021f425fa28b.jpg","MobileHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/0da435c7a44a06832a8d782b2f3f25e35db145cb.jpg"},"licenseName":"UNLICENSED"},"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-157.866,21.3071,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-157.866,21.3071,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.5645569620253164,"count":790},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Honolulu, HI"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/hawaii-pacific-university/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"31a4abb1-235b-4ec1-b22c-96c7c1c35ab7","content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"Plymouth State University","type":"College","url":"plymouth-state-university"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.7877},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":20844},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"860-1070"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Junior","body":"Plymouth State University is a place where everyone has a place.

The best thing about Wells are the professors. They are invested in you and see you as an individual and not as a number. If you're not doing particularly well, they can set up time for you to review the material because they want you to succeed. Most professors also send out internship opportunities so students can immerse themselves in that particular field.  Clubs like Querencia and Umoja, try to make the school as inclusive as possible by engaging students in hot topics like racism and segregation. They also strive on being active figures in the community, frequently hosting blood drives and potlucks. As an NCAA division 3 school, athletics are what you expect it to be, however, students on campus take their job as athletes seriously. Everyone tries to support each team by showing up to games especially for sports like Volleyball and Basketball.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2017-11-01T18:36:27.356579Z","guid":"fc2bcfcb-d9d1-415c-a33a-e597968bb57b","rating":5},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":2.66}],"photos":{"default":{"crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/735eb3e8a94a96772ab8c570f0f7ab331f9a0377.jpg","MobileHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/6cc203a682a3b221dd174d5e333f710e4f073cdd.jpg"},"licenseName":"UNLICENSED"},"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-76.696512,42.744314,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-76.696512,42.744314,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.1945392491467577,"count":293},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Aurora, NY"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/wells-college/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"3ef4203a-6279-491c-a58d-aa4f6f7c80c9","content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"Rivier University","type":"College","url":"rivier-university"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.7059},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":25120},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"880-1050"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Freshman","body":"I'm currently a freshman here at Rivier University and I couldn't have made a better choice for starting my nursing career.

This gave me so many opportunities and opened so many doors to my future career path.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2018-01-30T19:20:51.094953Z","guid":"76e7f54d-c1d2-4b64-8dec-f201b29db712","rating":5},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":3}],"photos":{"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-73.968037,40.690485,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-73.968037,40.690485,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.5482625482625485,"count":259},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Brooklyn, NY"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/st-josephs-college---new-york/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"11738a2c-535e-4bc4-b95c-6a7732a3f16e","content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":true,"isPremium":false,"name":"Piedmont College","type":"College","url":"piedmont-college"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.5715},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":17312},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"860-1090"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Sophomore","body":"Piedmont College is an outstanding school.

One of my favorite things about Keuka College is that it is a small campus and everyone you see is a familiar face. You are likely to develop a personal bond with most/all of your professors, and your professors know you by name, you're not just a number. If you are struggling in one of your classes, you can go to your professors office hours and get all of the help you need. Your professors set you up for success, not for failure. The campus is small and everything is within walking distance, which is really nice, especially when you're in a hurry. The college tries their best to offer activities for you to keep you busy, and of course, the lake being right in your backyard is a huge benefit!","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2017-01-24T00:22:25.334457Z","guid":"d489e6a2-8177-4803-9690-b53b0aef2c33","rating":4},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":2.66}],"photos":{"default":{"crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/e7eac12490c47bda531ce5c6250459f21c38535f.jpg","MobileHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/63f2c575d68f4a0a999f9dee228836318833513b.jpg"},"licenseName":"UNLICENSED"},"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-77.090518,42.61541,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-77.090518,42.61541,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.309823677581864,"count":397},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Keuka Park, NY"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/keuka-college/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"127c595c-1189-4f6a-bab1-4e1fb7248c61","content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"Wichita State University","type":"College","url":"wichita-state-university"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.8623},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":14175},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"915-1220"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Sophomore","body":"What I definitely love the most about Wichita State are the students. Everyone is connected to a very large friend group - from the people in their classes, to former or current roommates to friends of friends - and I love that! I'm a really extraverted person, so being able to make lots of connections and build relationships is something I find a lot of enjoyment in. However, I will say one of WSU's greatest downfalls is the use of Graduate Teaching Assistants (GTA) to teach an entire class. I know they'll have to one day teach a class, but a lot of the GTAs seem a little unprepared for it. Also, off the GTAs I have, some of them have even taught lecture for twenty minutes and let students go. Professors can take up the full hour with one lecture, so GTAs should be held to the same standard. In all honesty, this is just a small problem I have with WSU so far, so I hope it will change as I go forward in my degree program!","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2017-11-03T22:54:13.895863Z","guid":"3d22924d-21f9-46d1-8e96-5bad0f6904f9","rating":4},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":2.66}],"photos":{"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-97.296733,37.716484,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-97.296733,37.716484,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.586053412462908,"count":1348},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Wichita, KS"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/wichita-state-university/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"a0f566ad-11d3-485b-8879-df105d764754","content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"SUNY Farmingdale State College","type":"College","url":"suny-farmingdale-state-college"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.5802},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":8687},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"880-1060"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Alum","body":"My overall experience with Farmingdale State College was great. There’s a lot of diversity at Farmingdale, such as career choices, culture, and lifestyle . Farmingdale urges you to express exactly who you are. There are many clubs that allow you to really liberate yourself and express how you feel, what you like and that you are supported no matter what. I met a lot of people at very different stages in their lives. Some were like me, who went straight from high school into college. Others were returning to college or starting college for the first time ever who had graduated from high school years ago. Not only did I feel I had great peers, but I had outstanding professors who not only filled me with knowledge but genuinely cared about me and my process. The only thing I would change is  making clubs mandatory. So more students would attend.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2018-05-27T14:30:17.724711Z","guid":"acb8bba3-98ac-42da-9cc4-8ea5fe373aca","rating":4},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":3}],"photos":{"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-73.426371,40.75408,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-73.426371,40.75408,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.708,"count":500},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Farmingdale, NY"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/suny-farmingdale-state-college/#scatterplot"}}]}
