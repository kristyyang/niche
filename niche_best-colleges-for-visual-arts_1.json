Students are prone to more than one melt down—this is a given. But the wealth of knowledge, dialogue, and support that is exchanged and brought to its limits is invaluable. You will become a more critical and self-aware maker, designer, and thinker. You will learn to carve your own path and defend your ambitions. You will work so hard that everywhere elsewhere will feel like a breeze.

However, from what I've experienced, it's been overwhelmingly positive. The professors here are all skilled in a different areas, which makes Foundation year a very broad and interdisciplinary year. Indeed, students who want to focus on only one area of study find it tedious, but I found it very eye-opening. After all, I got the chance to work with mediums from paint to wood, which I've never touched. One truly exemplary part of RISD is the dining: they're very open to all types of eaters, and are open to change. If the food doesn't cover a wide enough spectrum, then there are methods of contacting the MET in order to change that. The MET staff are very kind and friendly, always open to conversation.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2018-03-29T09:04:16.437004Z","guid":"b4194fa2-89c2-4a15-ba50-180c1fb093e9","rating":4},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":4}],"photos":{"default":{"author":"woneffe","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/f7f8cd4dd5a6cb929c475a4063377a4266243e93.jpg","MobileHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/73b237c1328616a2c9b3ffcd5b0f0a128961bce3.jpg","Thumbnail":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/efa21c864eada53983b699012757771cd3bad7a8"},"licenseName":"CC BY-SA","licenseUrl":"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/","sourceUrl":"https://www.flickr.com/photos/woneffe/4048957944/"},"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-71.407692,41.825935,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-71.407692,41.825935,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.7114754098360656,"count":305},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Providence, RI"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/rhode-island-school-of-design/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"5747590f-e816-466d-a519-33f175061453","badge":{"display":"Best Colleges for Art in America","ordinal":3,"total":441,"vanityURL":"best-colleges-for-art"},"content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"Rice University","type":"College","url":"rice-university"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.1527},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":22061},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"1410-1570"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Sophomore","body":"Rice is incredible. The people are so friendly and collaborative, and the residential college system gives you an automatic support system and built-in friends/family. While people are smart, the atmosphere is close-knit and not cutthroat, which I've come to realize is hugely important when I hear my friends at other top universities talk about the pressure and competition they suffer through. The academics aren't easy- especially the STEM programs, which are structured to be some of the most rigorous in the country, but that's why we have such a good reputation and ease with post-graduation placements. Compared to other colleges, there's a lot of freedom with social life/partying and distribution requirements. Overall, the campus is beautiful and quality of life (dorms/food/area) very high.

Other miscellaneous thoughts: students have lots of autonomy, most campus dorms are nice or new, the campus is very safe and scenic, renn fayre is fun, the cafeteria (Commons) has good food, and Portland is an awesome city with lots to do, great food to eat, and lots of beer to drink.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2017-11-26T19:55:34.828491Z","guid":"67e3e510-5ac4-4968-a844-aac33b00dc9e","rating":5},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":4.33}],"photos":{"default":{"crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/d8efdd8dbc7ef732ff8e3b20e6ab55910c0ea5b7.jpg","MobileHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/862a89779f9bf28bf0b363fedcdbb63a95aab054.jpg"},"licenseName":"UNLICENSED"},"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-122.63064,45.480376,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-122.63064,45.480376,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.876,"count":250},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Portland, OR"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/reed-college/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"acb6d3e9-545a-4d7a-9770-95b15e9098ed","badge":{"display":"Best Colleges for Art in America","ordinal":14,"total":441,"vanityURL":"best-colleges-for-art"},"content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"School of the Art Institute of Chicago","type":"College","url":"school-of-the-art-institute-of-chicago"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.5932},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":43494},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"1020-1240"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Freshman","body":"SAIC is a great school, with great faculty that know what they are doing.

There is a great D-Fab lab that allows students to integrate 3-D printing and lazor cutting into their artistic practice.

The studios looked very professional, and the security system is very fast and trustworthy.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2017-03-13T10:26:57.978533Z","guid":"4f1ab24f-5c39-4238-8c64-278153beb856","rating":5},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":3}],"photos":{"default":{"crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/a9c2d9435dc59eb1cce0c74b55d761176de4469b.jpg","MobileHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/0321a92de8191189baaa4627700f6a6bdc8ac853.jpg"},"licenseName":"UNLICENSED"},"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-73.962149,40.691154,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-73.962149,40.691154,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.4912985274431056,"count":747},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Brooklyn, NY"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/pratt-institute/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"127ec524-4bac-4a5c-a7f5-1ead9c309f44","badge":{"display":"Best Colleges for Art in America","ordinal":23,"total":441,"vanityURL":"best-colleges-for-art"},"content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"Amherst College","type":"College","url":"amherst-college"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.1369},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":19055},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"1360-1555"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Sophomore","body":"Amherst is simply an amazing institution.
