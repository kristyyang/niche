As a double major, communicating with the teachers and advisors is a key part to it. Overall, I feel that Siena is the best choice for me, and have had great experiences with all teachers. While on campus, many of the staff members will get to know you by name, not as a number. To me, it is really important to recognize students and call them by name, as it makes you feel important. There is always a Campus Safety Guard around for emergencies, and they are very quick responders. The campus is well diverse, but all students are welcoming and accepting of each other.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2018-04-27T01:09:36.640892Z","guid":"f5eb111c-ee6c-47f4-b1bf-ef96ce0c7c89","rating":4},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":2.66}],"photos":{"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-84.015144,41.905952,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-84.015144,41.905952,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.4545454545454546,"count":440},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Adrian, MI"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/siena-heights-university/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"38b5a1e7-d78d-4561-b8a3-ff91e90f11f5","content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"Geneva College","type":"College","url":"geneva-college"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.7057},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":20223},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"950-1180"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Freshman","body":"Geneva College is  great school.

I give Mars hill a thumbs up because I've thoroughly enjoyed my experience here and I would recommend this school to others!","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2017-03-10T17:30:17.315285Z","guid":"3f015577-a6f5-4fc9-819a-57855e8bca24","rating":4},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":2.33}],"photos":{"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-82.550859,35.825858,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-82.550859,35.825858,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.2576923076923077,"count":520},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Mars Hill, NC"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/mars-hill-university/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"75a16df0-14b5-4c27-b7c9-ac42bb1fdfa2","content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"Centenary College - New Jersey","type":"College","url":"centenary-college---new-jersey"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.8788},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":21847},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"830-1050"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Junior","body":"I have been at Centenary for one semester and I absolutely love it! I am a commuter student so I thought it would be hard to make friends and transition from a community college, but to my surprise it has been so easy! The people that I have met so far have been some of the nicest people I have ever met. The school itself is small and my department is small, so it is easy to connect with people and professors. The professors in my department have been very helpful and friendly with everything and the professors do care about their students. They do want to help when you have a problem and do care about their students. There is a lot of work, but it actually teaches you and the lectures are very engaging due to the small class sizes. Even though I do live at home and commute, I do feel at home in this area and at this school.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2018-01-04T16:25:40.92854Z","guid":"bce6d1ce-651c-4c80-8856-86ec0a6f479f","rating":4},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":2.33}],"photos":{"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-74.832775,40.848693,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-74.832775,40.848693,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.3544776119402986,"count":268},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Hackettstown, NJ"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/centenary-college---new-jersey/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"bf8a4960-1f34-4835-879d-c4edd6a8887d","content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"Dominican University of California","type":"College","url":"dominican-university-of-california"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.7775},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":34339},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"918-1123"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Freshman","body":"My experience at Dominican University has created nothing more than a positive environment that has enhanced my overall experience as a first year student.

I feel extremely safe at my school as campus security is always there for you no matter the time of night. Being that I am an African American going to a school where I am the minority I was initially concerned about being discriminated against. However, the school goes to enormous efforts to stress the importance of equality. In today's society, it is nice to know that the university I attend seems me just as everyone else.

We should be capable of making our own mature decisions pertaining to the opposite gender. \nThe smallness of Concordia is one of its positives and negatives.

Livingstone College is the ultimate place to receive a second chance.Livingstone College is an important place that is leading me into a bright and successful future. My college experience at Livingstone College has led me to self-discovery, self-improvement and personal growth. My major is Education, and I have been taking courses that are designed for my major. My future career goal is to be an elementary school teacher.Here at Livingstone, they provide the students with the resources to be successful. The Reading and Writing Center helps students write and revise their papers. When I have writers block I go there and receive help. The classroom sizes are scant which allows the teacher to know the students. I enjoy having that because I can receive one on one help.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2018-05-16T00:26:17.523962Z","guid":"7cdd9a71-2000-41c5-a55b-7f216ade4a76","rating":4},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":1.33}],"photos":{"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-80.484459,35.670743,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-80.484459,35.670743,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.2267441860465116,"count":516},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Salisbury, NC"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/livingstone-college/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"ae0a31d3-30b9-430e-89d6-a6014384114d","content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"Our Lady of the Lake University","type":"College","url":"our-lady-of-the-lake-university"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.5473},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":18754},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"830-1010"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Junior","body":"Such a wonderful school!
