The academics, though limited, offered amazing career choices. The soccer field where I dreamed of playing was one like none I’ve ever seen. Situated in the mountain with scenic views that in the fall season looked like something out of a painting. \n     In the fall of 2016 my dream became reality as I began my life as an SVC student athlete.

The difficult 1 or 2 instructors are exceptions to that rule. In short, almost all of the instructors there are incredibly helpful and invested in their students' success. I have, on rare occasions, had a difficult interaction or experience with 1 instructor in 10, but nothing that we could not work thru. Also, the school's administration have their heads squarely attached to their shoulders. Mrs. Markowitz, Dr. Quigley, and Mrs. Sheldon are all terrific administrators that set a great standard of practice and tone for everyone else in the school. Dr. Quigley did graduate work on the topic of men in nursing, and this makes male students much more comfortable entering into this \"woman's profession\". This is a great school for students serious about being well equipped for success in the nursing profession. If you want an easy ride or are unsure what you want to do with your life, then maybe go somewhere else first.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2017-04-24T21:49:11.511352Z","guid":"4ede0a8a-4079-4b4b-a55f-52fee92a693f","rating":5},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":4.33}],"photos":{"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-76.148355,43.055355,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-76.148355,43.055355,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.607142857142857,"count":28},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"2 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Syracuse, NY"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/st-josephs-college-of-nursing/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"2bf38072-718c-4977-b90a-cf8ebf903465","content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"Judson College","type":"College","url":"judson-college"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.5755},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":17232},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"1110-1112"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Sophomore","body":"Judson is a smaller private college so you get more one on one time with your professors.

The colleagues that went to school with me were friendly and inclusive, which made me feel like I fit in well.  The student mentors that also occupied the school with me were pretty friendly and helpful as well, providing advice and tips towards success.  The professors that I have had so far have been quite helpful with their investment in the success of students.  They are all open for questions if a student is confused about an assignment or topic of discussion.  In fact, some of them are even willing to arrange special meetings outside of school with the students during their office hours at Alvernia University if it is necessary.  Overall, if an individual is in search of a school to attend for the purpose of entering the medical field, then the Reading Hospital School of Health Sciences does not fall short from being recommendable.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2017-05-09T02:01:02.972126Z","guid":"bc464cb8-3f15-403d-8eaf-4b98787f5ee6","rating":5},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":3.66}],"photos":{"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-75.95027,40.325701,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-75.95027,40.325701,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.5,"count":80},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"2 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Reading, PA"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/the-reading-hospital-school-of-health-sciences/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"cdbd5aff-f872-46db-9254-c6006675bd5d","content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"St. Elizabeth School of Nursing","type":"College","url":"st-elizabeth-school-of-nursing"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":1},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":17307},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"940-1030"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Freshman","body":"I love St. Elizabeth.

It has provided me with the right tools I need to sharpen my skills in my field of choice (Nursing).  There has been many opportunities to learn more ways of improving my crafts as a result of my time in school, and for that I am truly grateful. For example, the assistance provided during clinicals from all the nurses has been remarkable—allotting us students all that they know in attempts to create the best future nurses. If anything can change, I would like to eventually see more professors teaching here at this school. For what the school has, they do an awesome job. However, if provided more staff, it will reduce the stress load drastically which will create an even better environment overall. Ultimately, I’ve come to find out that going to college is as much about finding out who you really are as it is about getting that degree and the college you attend truly does matter.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2018-01-11T05:04:28.499055Z","guid":"9442c997-586f-4c0c-a4f6-c1c00c18e761","rating":4},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade"}],"photos":{"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-73.201106,41.201198,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-73.201106,41.201198,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.4,"count":35},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Bridgeport, CT"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/st-vincents-college---connecticut/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"65a8f0c6-f10c-46d8-a194-fccb98c3f463","content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"Central Maine Medical Center College of Nursing & Health Professions","type":"College","url":"central-maine-medical-center-college-of-nursing--and--health-professions"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.4615},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":16590},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"830-980"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Freshman","body":"This is a great school.
