Hunter offers a plethora of majors to choose from as well as different clubs to keep students engaged. There are also activities and events held on campus. The workload may be overwhelming at times but I regard it as excellent preparation for graduate school and an opportunity to challenge myself. The location of Hunter is convenient; it is located in the city so your choices don't fall short when it comes to food. Hunter has a library on nine floors. My complaint is that when you attend Hunter no one tells you anything unless you ask many, many questions! I know several people who took the incorrect class for their major, wasting time and money. Additionally, I feel that in large lecture halls with more than 100 students, there isn't a chance to receive individualized attention. The classroom size should be smaller so professors can focus on every students' needs and struggles.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2018-01-16T22:01:16.773582Z","guid":"61dee6aa-64ee-4526-9449-0dd06859694f","rating":4},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":3}],"photos":{"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-73.964795,40.768669,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-73.964795,40.768669,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.439636752136752,"count":1872},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"New York, NY"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/cuny-hunter-college/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"0dbce4cf-b166-4b47-9414-e3ee223ef2a6","content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"University of Puerto Rico - Rio Piedras","type":"College","url":"university-of-puerto-rico---rio-piedras"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.5125},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":2048},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"1025-1298"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Freshman","body":"In the University of Puerto Rico, Rio Piedras Campus, you can find students from around the globe whose goals are to complete undergraduate, grad-school, and PhDs.

It's affordability is amazing, the college has its own police department, as well as a state police building on campus, the local area is nice, however rather small, but that's great for people who aren't a fan of large cities! There are parties going on somewhere every weekend for people looking to have fun. The food is pretty good at the kitchen, and there's plenty of restaurants scattered about campus.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2018-02-06T16:29:25.942781Z","guid":"de589bea-1847-423b-b574-154384f83106","rating":4},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":3}],"photos":{"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-84.301356,37.740396,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-84.301356,37.740396,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.4942938659058487,"count":1402},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Richmond, KY"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/eastern-kentucky-university/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"976981eb-05a4-47d8-bfff-adffc1259343","content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"CUNY New York City College of Technology","type":"College","url":"cuny-new-york-city-college-of-technology"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.7452},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":7498},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"843-1030"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Niche User","body":"The New York City College of Technology provides students with a diverse culture of students and professors. This culture helps other students  understand more about students with different backgrounds and can develop a strong relationship with one another. Furthermore, this college provides students with easy access to multiple rooms where students can study, write papers, and do group projects without any distractions.

Professors and school staff are friendly and supportive. Beaches are close by for breaks.\nThe Bad: Laulima website used by almost every professor crashes often and can cramp your style in a major way so work should be turned in well before deadlines to avoid this. Also, the beaches can eat up your entire day so maybe study first. \nThe Ugly: Tuition is insane. Highly recommend finding places to donate plasma/blood/etc or do some busking to help with tuition. If tuition doesn't scare you, the housing costs will for sure. Also, sunburns from napping at the beach -because midterms kept you up all night are brutal.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2018-03-26T21:44:12.947746Z","guid":"a9529299-57a2-4154-8912-f019b756e7a9","rating":5},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":3.33}],"photos":{"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-157.816607,21.292648,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-157.816607,21.292648,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.415031115366204,"count":2089},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Honolulu, HI"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/university-of-hawaii-at-manoa/#scatterplot"}}]}
