There are plenty of programs that are there to help if you are struggling outside and inside of the school. There are also rewards for students who maintain a GPA of 3.0 and above as well as programs that recognizes students who are not quite at the 3.0 mark bug still shows their ambition to succeed. I think the best part was getting first pick in registration because I am registered with the accessibility center.

At least they have the commons food where the Burger King and Georges Cafe is. The dorms and housing is beautiful. I live in the towers and they are very nice, next year I will be moving into the sorority house though and those are also very nice. The parties on the weekend are good and most of the time safe.

It is very possible to get a 4.0 if you show up to class and put in the effort, which for some classes requires less work than others.  I gave 4/5 because of the parking situation although they are trying to improve this situation by adding across the street parking.

You get the small town feel on a university campus that is second to none!","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2018-04-26T22:23:39.3296Z","guid":"dcac116d-d7f7-4b31-b44a-70be89096eb2","rating":5},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":3.33}],"photos":{"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-92.459703,42.514923,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-92.459703,42.514923,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.5916733386709367,"count":1249},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Cedar Falls, IA"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/university-of-northern-iowa/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"70b48f96-472a-429a-89cd-4bddbd15f942","content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"University of West Georgia","type":"College","url":"university-of-west-georgia"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.5909},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":14285},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"870-1010"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Sophomore","body":"The University of West Georgia has an excellent campus.

With a campus in the \"capital of the world\", the location provides opportunities unrivaled by others.  By planning ahead, you can schedule classes with some top-notch professors who actively help students succeed and provide an unforgettable learning experience.  Though Core requirements are extensive, even excessive to some, they make way for an education that explores all fields.  The Jesuit presence is in no way overbearing and the community is open to a diversity of thought (Professors are almost always unrelated to the Church; even theology classes teach a variety of religions).  The Rose Hill campus is quite beautiful, boasting sports teams, a large library, and a variety of eateries.  Both campuses are very safe and any incidents are vigilantly pursued by campus safety and the NYPD. Fordham can be a very good experience, if deemed worth the price point (note they do award aid) and if one is willing to take advantage of their time there.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2018-06-05T17:39:23.039915Z","guid":"c7e106e7-e1c4-45d2-8987-d3382185aaa0","rating":4},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":3.66}],"photos":{"default":{"crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/58a16aa62394c04c88abf70482b6dfc699f8d219.jpg","MobileHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/2a5478c448466060f510b754b7a99112cf2dbc0c.jpg"},"licenseName":"UNLICENSED"},"mapbox_header":{"crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-73.889578,40.861183,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-73.889578,40.861183,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"UNLICENSED"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.4920049200492005,"count":1626},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Bronx, NY"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/fordham-university/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"05743090-4c01-4667-97f6-e0a96e1c135d","content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":true,"isPremium":false,"name":"Youngstown State University","type":"College","url":"youngstown-state-university"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.6745},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":11271},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"850-1090"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Freshman","body":"YSU is a great college to go to if you like a small campus but the educational opportunities of a large college or university. Class sizes are relatively small the professor to student ratio is about 14:1. Small classes allow students to get he individual help that they might need or want. The educational benefits of YSU are amazing for a same state university. \nAlthough, there are somethings I would like to see change. There are not a lot of students that live on campus, there are only three dorm buildings in total. It almost feels like a commuter school in the sense that there are a lot of students that just go to class and then drive home. Weekends are very quiet and there aren't a lot of parties going on mostly because of the lack of students on campus. But, there is some change happening! YSU is building new apartment building the students can stay in. There are three apartment complexes around campus, University Edge, University Courtyards and they are build The Enclave.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2018-01-24T01:32:35.918307Z","guid":"78d2a013-3d7d-4c4b-9ed7-008f4de5ba5f","rating":4},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":2.66}],"photos":{"default":{"crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/ec6d071a1123c50daa4893e11be6a754c68ade5e.jpg","MobileHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/54a7fa7d83aa7f5def609bf299c699913f1ec09f.jpg"},"licenseName":"UNLICENSED"},"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-80.646515,41.105583,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-80.646515,41.105583,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.4008264462809916,"count":1210},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Youngstown, OH"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/youngstown-state-university/#scatterplot"}}]}
