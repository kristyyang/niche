Sometimes people may think we are inside a small circle on our own, but we do learn subjects that are out of our value and beliefs. Because the school's little smaller than other colleges, students can directly relate themselves to the faculties (who are very passionate about teaching).

It is not a typical college campus with brick buildings and grassy fields.

I would never trade this for another \"typical\" school. In terms of academics, everything is accessible through student tutoring sessions, group review sessions (highly advisable). It's challenging (especially if you do the Honors College), but worth your while. THe study abroad programs are EXCELLENT. I did 2 of them myself, and definitely recommend it-- they find a way to finance whatever study abroad you want to do, through their scholarship office. \nI only take 1 star away because I was a commuter and did not enjoy VCU as much as the residential students. However, the commute is also highly doable and there is a lot of parking available to students.
