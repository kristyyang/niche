SLU has given me life long friends and an education that I am proud of. So far my classes have gone well and are usually well taught. If there are any complaints, there are always surveys at the end of the semester that go straight to the department heads for review. Finding the right college for you is difficult.

It was a little hard to adjust and make new friends at first. Then my classmates started to talk to me so I opened up little by little.

It is centered around family and Franciscan values that more people should live by. People are USUALLY friendly. \nDOWNSIDES that I notice are the occasional talk about drinking and partying. If you are a student that does not party or drink, then you might feel uncomfortable and may find it hard to relate to these peers but if you are able to focus on yourself and don't give in to peer pressure, you should be fine and l. There are soo many clubs you can take part in such as the Laugh Pack, plays, sports, Mountain Community Leaders, and much more. The campus is big on Sustainability and Environmental education. Another Downside I notice is that if you are an environmental Science major, there is only one professor that teaches most of the related and required courses that you need to take so if you don't like that professor, you are stuck with him.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2018-01-22T02:09:46.788381Z","guid":"6a5ba709-3575-4ef7-ab39-067c7e19cb81","rating":5},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":3.33}],"photos":{"default":{"crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/4f10633795264bc68f217d2de4b877d0c97220eb.jpg","MobileHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/6cbb0c14d5d6a79b61567239e67ecef009fecc9f.jpg"},"licenseName":"UNLICENSED"},"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-78.47586,42.07863,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-78.47586,42.07863,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.560493827160494,"count":405},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Saint Bonaventure, NY"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/st-bonaventure-university/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"ddb7533e-fd42-462b-8ea7-92ca5bb17476","badge":{"display":"Best Colleges for Communications in America","ordinal":220,"total":714,"vanityURL":"best-colleges-for-communications"},"content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"University of Mississippi","type":"College","url":"university-of-mississippi"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.783},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":14678},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"1000-1230"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Sophomore","body":"My visit at University Of Mississippi was wonderful, the college had so much to offer for the teachers, parents, and students.

He entered in the Fall of 2016 into the honors program. The opportunities he's had thus far have been amazing. HPU delivers on everything and more. In addition, my son #1 decided to transfer to HPU in the Fall of 2016 as well. Two brothers, same school, very different experiences and both having an extraordinary education and experience.\nI read everything on the internet about HPU, much good, some not so good. I was so nervous about whether or not we had made a good decision.  I couldn't be more pleased with HPU and proud that my boys are part of such a warm, loving college community.

Queens is a very small campus, it'll take you 5 minutes to walk to the farthest part on campus! The student body closely resembles that of the size of a high school (2,500-3,000) students. Queens is also a liberal arts school so here we focus a lot on the arts and you are required to take some arts courses because of this, but I loved it; it broadened my knowledge and forced me to take courses that I may not have taken otherwise. Because of the size of the school the ratio of professor to student is along the lines of 1:17, which is great because you are NOT known as just a number here, you are an individual that the Professor actually gets to know. It makes your experience better when you know that your Professor cares about you.

In addition to memories, the staff had a profound impact on me and how I carry myself to this day. Whether it be an intro class or a more fine-tuned 400-level class, each professor that has given a lecture to me has granted me the opportunity of hearing new insight and viewing the world in a fresh perspective. \n\nI resided in Ellicott Complex, which served as shelter for my first-year experience. The cleanliness and proximity to class/dining is unparalleled. My brother, another UB student, resided in Goodyear and has the same opinion as I for Ellicott.

It varies but still great class sizes. \n\nThe university of Alabama in Huntsville also offers FREE TUTORS!","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2017-09-09T14:32:58.677726Z","guid":"2f9373b5-71ee-49d9-b593-efc5e24c2233","rating":4},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":3.66}],"photos":{"default":{"crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/7ac6bae225c95ea161b599e812c6521aaa66b250.jpg","MobileHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/9714b0e200c1f8523104de5c4609e6ba53a82ac1.jpg"},"licenseName":"UNLICENSED"},"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-86.63842,34.722818,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-86.63842,34.722818,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.6296829971181555,"count":694},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Huntsville, AL"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/the-university-of-alabama-in-huntsville/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"b6fa95d1-441d-4568-ab4d-6e8fe10653ca","badge":{"display":"Best Colleges for Communications in America","ordinal":235,"total":714,"vanityURL":"best-colleges-for-communications"},"content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"Berry College","type":"College","url":"berry-college"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.6209},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":24811},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"1060-1240"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Sophomore","body":"Berry College has an amazing student to professor ratio.
