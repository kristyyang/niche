My course and professors all inspired me to find my passion. I changed my major after the first semester; which allowed me to explore the different career paths before I chose my current career goal. ASU truly opened my eyes to a lot of wonderful opportunities. I am taking my experiences working alongside my peers in the school newspaper \"State Press\" and student outreach \"Programming and Activities Board\" to learn valuable work ethics for future career skills. As a medical studies major, I still find it important to surround myself with other activities and involvements that are not related to my major. Therefore, the school paper gives me sense of the journalism world and the PAB allows me to explore skills in marketing and event planning. Overall, my experience at ASU change my life and improved my skills that pertains to social, professional, and personal life skills.

This year we had casino night,rock the rec, capture the flag and a glow in the dark paint party. Casino night was where we played black jack and poker. They also had a \"bar\" which consisted of virgin drinks. Rock the rec consisted of key logging, silent disco, glow in the dark dodgeball and rock climbing. We played capture the flag until 2am and last but not least, we had a huge rave paint party with an awesome DJ until close to midnight. \n\nClass wise, the classes aren't huge unlike UA or Auburn which is great for one on one time.

The Philosophy department is one of the best in the country and the German department is fairly small but offers a variety of courses. I was also fortunate enough to study abroad in Germany through Rutgers. There are  scholarship opportunities to offset expenses, and my experience was incredible! The bus system used to transport students from one campus to another is unfortunately sub-par. The drivers take frequent and long breaks, which inconveniences students trying to get to class. A majority of buses themselves don't seem to be well maintained, either, and the bus schedule is unreliable. The quality and variety of the dining hall food is OK, depending on which you go to. There is a lot of cultural and racial diversity on campus, and many different types of course studies, clubs, events, etc. to choose from.

When choosing a school my senior year of high school, I was very torn between OSU and another school. Ultimately, I knew Ohio State was the best fit for me, and it has way exceeded my expectations since arriving in August. The amount of school spirit everyone has is unlike anything I've ever experienced and everyone truly is just so happy to be a buckeye. The challenging coursework and excellent professors make Ohio State's academic experience one of a kind.

As a psychology major it is hard to get into classes you need as they close out, even if you came in with a ton of AP credits. Also, so many classes are big so its harder to focus and do well in them. The campus is hilly. Academics are great, i’ve only had one bad teacher. Advising sucks I had to figure everything out on my own. Mountainview dorms were awfull, invisible RA, no community events, unfriendly people etc. Now I live in Newing and I love it and it’s so much better! Many Long Island students, intentational students (mostly from Asia) and Jewish students. You have to find your people at this school but once you do your experience can be great. Also, we don’t have certain majors like education (also communications, and others people complain about) which really sucks but they try to sell you on their grad program. The food is hit or miss, definitely go to the Kosher station since they have the best food.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2018-05-23T01:30:53.174035Z","guid":"98f168b2-72e9-48d0-bb5e-1cc0fdef30f8","rating":4},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":3.66}],"photos":{"default":{"crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/843cc93be5f59a4bf97adb882d92fccaf932660b.jpg","MobileHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/e1bba7684cb59ca91b80ae5381f80c29566dec0c.jpg"},"licenseName":"UNLICENSED"},"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-75.971143,42.088049,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-75.971143,42.088049,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.5464154411764706,"count":2176},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Vestal, NY"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/binghamton-university-suny/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"7506bda8-994b-4e7a-a0b8-cbd64bed03bb","badge":{"display":"Best Colleges for Computer Science in America","ordinal":122,"total":494,"vanityURL":"best-colleges-for-computer-science"},"content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"Union College - New York","type":"College","url":"union-college---new-york"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.369},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":38621},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"1220-1400"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Senior","body":"Review Continued: The social scene is Greek dominated; the Minerva system is an absolute joke. Parties are moving off campus. The administration is cracking down on Greek life HARD! On campus parties are no longer the same, and are pretty much used as pre games for the off campus parties, Wednesdays nights are practically nonexistent compared to what it was when I was a freshman thanks to the cops and administration (more of a small gathering night for upperclassmen), and Thursday AD dinner parties (which is a frat known for hosting the spot to be on a Thursday night) no longer exist due to the administration. Spring term at Union is still pretty lit though, given that we have ReUnion weekend, Lobster Fest, and Spring Fest. The social scene for the most part, given that Greek life makes up 70% of the student body (Union butchers this statistic as it includes freshman, even though you can't pledge until sophomore year) is getting blackout and going to an off campus party nowadays.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2016-12-22T18:45:44.991174Z","guid":"3f25e605-a90b-4599-8c44-58eda1d27e16","rating":4},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":4}],"photos":{"default":{"author":"jirka_matousek","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/1c50f212b43127310b4796fcdc08c4db170301ea.jpg","MobileHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/a085f7463737d2d7a537e43fac12c8fa2f8c5316.jpg","Thumbnail":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/ff1a2a9f6b4a027509cca9cc5f8c02efce604fcd"},"licenseName":"CC BY ","licenseUrl":"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/2.0/","sourceUrl":"https://www.flickr.com/photos/jirka_matousek/8374084149/"},"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-73.928498,42.817578,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-73.928498,42.817578,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.601923076923077,"count":520},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Schenectady, NY"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/union-college---new-york/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"e05deabf-5fd5-4b71-abf0-5ab0752065a6","badge":{"display":"Best Colleges for Computer Science in America","ordinal":123,"total":494,"vanityURL":"best-colleges-for-computer-science"},"content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"United States Air Force Academy","type":"College","url":"united-states-air-force-academy"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.1508},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price"},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"1220-1410"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Freshman","body":"USAFA has been a challenge.

The campus is unlike any I've seen before; you practically forget that you're walking around a college campus because you get so immersed in the beautiful scenic redwood forest around you.  UCSC is also very close to the ocean, making it a great location for those who love to frequent the beach.  Aside from location, I have had great experiences academically with this school.  All of my professors have been extremely kind and genuinely interested in the wellbeing and learning process of their students.  Finally, UCSC is a school that is extremely accepting of people from all different backgrounds, sexual orientations, and cultures and strives to make all students feel welcome.
