The campus is small, so you get more one on one time in class. This helped me to learn more and made me more confident around my classmates.

Everything I experienced in Commerce made me appreciate the small campus and I loved every moment.

The people and staff are welcoming, helpful, and hard working. The campus is comforting with its acres of woods surrounding it, and safe. Having various clubs and activities going on around campus, there is no excuse for having nothing to do. The services offered here are great, ranging from career assistance, tutoring, to health and fitness. My favorite part about the campus, and also the first thing I noticed was the many critters running around. We are accompanied by cute squirrels, chipmunks, birds, etc. If you are trying to get away from the city and home, the Johnstown campus is the perfect fit.

For its low cost, the education you can receive here is outstanding. With myriad departments run by doctoral professors, the opportunities for success and engagement do not end. I have been able to find multiple internships in my field and connect with opportunities for advancing my education after MCLA thanks to my advisors.

Which makes you feel very safe. The campus is small and beautiful and gives a home feeling like no other college I looked into. I am a commuter so I can not say what it is like living on campus.

I find that CSULA is very safety-conscious, maintains an excellent campus environment and student life, and hires very impressive and motivated professors who instill knowledge and their own passions into the students they teach. However, if there are two aspects that I would like to see CSULA improve on, they would be the local area and campus food. I would appreciate it if there were interesting activities to participate in in the local area and if there was a much bigger variety of healthy food choices aside from the food trucks and the food court.

While working on my associates degree, I was able to take classes that easily transferred over to fulfill my bachelors degree requirements. This was very helpful to me because I didn't want to be put back in the 4 year college track. Saint Xavier also offers many scholarships and makes it very easy to set up a non interest payment plan throughout the year. What I would change about the school is that I would offer a greater variety of courses. I would also enjoy having more lounge space in the hallways since many of the students and myself are commuters. Furthermore, I would recommend the school to invest in finding a way to add more parking space because parking is always filled and very hard to find. Overall, I really enjoy the atmosphere and the small school setting, because the professors, students, and alumni are very welcoming and kind.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2017-10-12T19:26:36.229331Z","guid":"9b6614dd-2dbe-493c-ae0f-33d84487500c","rating":4},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":2.66}],"photos":{"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-87.713507,41.707763,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-87.713507,41.707763,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.5204819277108435,"count":830},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Chicago, IL"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/saint-xavier-university/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"79936a20-95cf-4070-8a64-cbc5447fedcb","content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"La Sierra University","type":"College","url":"la-sierra-university"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.4593},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":23414},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"780-1030"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Freshman","body":"La Sierra University is a very inviting, welcoming, and easy-going campus. The teachers are great, paying attention to the needs and desires of every student. The atmosphere is also beautiful, with views of both Mount San Jacinto and the San Bernardino Mountains. The campus is extremely diverse with people from all over the world. It is a great place to be yourself and express yourself without having to hide. It is also a very religious campus with a large emphasis and focus on God and a person's relationship with God. Overall, the school is pretty good, I would recommend it!","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2017-01-19T05:10:51.094545Z","guid":"bc9a3f93-c7fe-4b40-bfa1-eee19b883307","rating":4},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":3}],"photos":{"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-117.497071,33.908834,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-117.497071,33.908834,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.491778774289985,"count":669},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Riverside, CA"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/la-sierra-university/#scatterplot"}}]}
