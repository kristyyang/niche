The food here is good, but also could be better.  As far as tuition, I think they should provide more scholarships for students who pay out of pocket. When choosing a college,   it is important to feel like you have made the best decision. At AUM, my decision, I believe hascollegbeen fulfilled.

Basically, it's pretty cool.\n\nThe students are also pretty awesome. I never did anything with greek life and met my friends mostly through nerdy clubs (games club, anime, video games, etc), so my friend group is contrastingly diverse (though quite extensive) relative to the other reviewers.\n\nThe Comp Sci program (my area) here is also definitely growing, so I'm excited to see what happens.

One thing to note, is that I wish the staff was a little bit more consistent; several times I had to get things run through again before they finally became current.  Just watch those applications and keep up to date with it.  Overall, it's a great school!
