The Jesuit presence is in no way overbearing and the community is open to a diversity of thought (Professors are almost always unrelated to the Church; even theology classes teach a variety of religions).  The Rose Hill campus is quite beautiful, boasting sports teams, a large library, and a variety of eateries.  Both campuses are very safe and any incidents are vigilantly pursued by campus safety and the NYPD. Fordham can be a very good experience, if deemed worth the price point (note they do award aid) and if one is willing to take advantage of their time there.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2018-06-05T17:39:23.039915Z","guid":"c7e106e7-e1c4-45d2-8987-d3382185aaa0","rating":4},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":3.66}],"photos":{"default":{"crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/58a16aa62394c04c88abf70482b6dfc699f8d219.jpg","MobileHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/2a5478c448466060f510b754b7a99112cf2dbc0c.jpg"},"licenseName":"UNLICENSED"},"mapbox_header":{"crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-73.889578,40.861183,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-73.889578,40.861183,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"UNLICENSED"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.4920049200492005,"count":1626},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Bronx, NY"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/fordham-university/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"b212d30a-2d53-42db-b405-ed141a637592","badge":{"display":"Best Colleges for Psychology in America","ordinal":158,"total":993,"vanityURL":"best-colleges-for-psychology"},"content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":true,"isPremium":false,"name":"Arizona State University","type":"College","url":"arizona-state-university"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.825},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":13007},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"1020-1280"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Junior","body":"My experience at ASU was an experience like no other.

I am taking my experiences working alongside my peers in the school newspaper \"State Press\" and student outreach \"Programming and Activities Board\" to learn valuable work ethics for future career skills. As a medical studies major, I still find it important to surround myself with other activities and involvements that are not related to my major.

The professors really care about each student's needs and goals, and they are willing to help students at a personal level. There is always something to do on campus and most people I have met (in and out of classes) are nice and outgoing. The campus definitely has a home feel for me. Some downsides are the food (which isn't great) and some of the extra things that come with it being a small school. For example, registering for certain majors can be extremely difficult because of limited class options and there are less options for housing, food, and activities than on a larger campus. Des Moines is also a nice in-between sized city! There is always something to do but it isn't a huge adjustment if you come from a smaller area.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2018-05-31T04:35:19.549811Z","guid":"24632281-62d0-4d5a-909b-f782c1b1f5aa","rating":4},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":3.66}],"photos":{"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-93.654062,41.60381,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-93.654062,41.60381,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.663507109004739,"count":844},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Des Moines, IA"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/drake-university/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"281a6b63-fdca-42bc-819d-f4e6502dd62d","badge":{"display":"Best Colleges for Psychology in America","ordinal":160,"total":993,"vanityURL":"best-colleges-for-psychology"},"content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"University of Massachusetts - Amherst","type":"College","url":"university-of-massachusetts---amherst"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.5968},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":20093},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"1130-1330"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Alum","body":"Umass Amherst is located in a spectacular location shared by several other amazing colleges.

This skill is more important than ever because in 5-10 years, there will be jobs and industries that do not even exist yet.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2017-08-01T14:37:26.301636Z","guid":"d47e0aa0-eed3-467c-86a2-4d804c27abcd","rating":5},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":3.66}],"photos":{"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-77.197854,40.202796,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-77.197854,40.202796,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.4772727272727275,"count":528},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Carlisle, PA"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/dickinson-college/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"b87bfe59-6b7a-47db-b3db-7e77d2025249","badge":{"display":"Best Colleges for Psychology in America","ordinal":166,"total":993,"vanityURL":"best-colleges-for-psychology"},"content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"Westminster College - Utah","type":"College","url":"westminster-college---utah"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.8409},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":24606},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"1000-1210"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Freshman","body":"I love being a student here at Westminster!

Also our school is a dry campus and we take pride in that!","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2017-09-27T20:17:40.337614Z","guid":"70a19249-dce7-4dde-a34c-e10ca789f8fc","rating":5},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":3.66}],"photos":{"default":{"crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/fa8dd306587ac01eddc3232a0968fe16a43b03c3.jpg","MobileHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/7d93bc86777665d4ba9e3cf002acd66e34f17116.jpg"},"licenseName":"UNLICENSED"},"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-86.105376,42.788052,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-86.105376,42.788052,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.6886291179596173,"count":941},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Holland, MI"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/hope-college/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"e3d4751e-98d6-483b-ac91-89481256bfc7","badge":{"display":"Best Colleges for Psychology in America","ordinal":173,"total":993,"vanityURL":"best-colleges-for-psychology"},"content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":true,"isPremium":false,"name":"University of Dallas","type":"College","url":"university-of-dallas"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.8047},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":25197},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"1040-1290"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Sophomore","body":"Equipped with a rigorous core curriculum and a close-knit community, UD is a nourishing campus. Some crusaders may complain about the reading done at UD, but UD teaches its students the truth about living. We’ve all read Homer, Milton and Dante by the end of our first year in addition to Aristotle, Plato and Aquinas! It’s not just an education based on the sciences but a well-rounded one. The campus is built with boring architecture but within those walls are a family of students and staff who hold on to unique traditions. Groundhog week is only a sneak peek into the energetic and creative life of a crusader. I love UD if there was anything I could improve at UD that would be the Asian Food section in the cafeteria!","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2018-05-27T07:15:52.10381Z","guid":"9ac631be-d6d8-446a-885c-ac5a86b74816","rating":5},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":3.66}],"photos":{"default":{"crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/2c4917a791c4ab2a80f18f22a89c3efabf61e3e9.jpg","MobileHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/7901f500ef29cddd7e11e12728afad910104670a.jpg"},"licenseName":"UNLICENSED"},"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-96.9179,32.8443,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-96.9179,32.8443,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.7164835164835166,"count":455},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Irving, TX"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/university-of-dallas/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"17bc125d-a7ab-4df1-a556-e0e15ba2fdd1","badge":{"display":"Best Colleges for Psychology in America","ordinal":174,"total":993,"vanityURL":"best-colleges-for-psychology"},"content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"Allegheny College","type":"College","url":"allegheny-college"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.6776},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":26517},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"1050-1270"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Alum","body":"Allegheny is a hidden gem to American private liberal arts colleges.

If you want to study what you love, this is a great environment for that. Academics are challenging and immersive once you get past the introductory classes, and 100 level courses are always really interesting without being overwhelming. \n\nIn terms of student life, the area is excellent.
