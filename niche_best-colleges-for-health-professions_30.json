Let me be clear - if you want a huge state school where you can walk into the cafeteria and no one will recognize you, Averett is not for you. But if you want to speak to almost everyone you pass on your way to class, have professors who take time to get to know you and will ask if y'all can catch up after you graduate, have the opportunity to take on leadership roles in your extra curricular activities, and become a part of a FAMILY, Averett should be your number one choice.\n\nThe professors and advisors are phenomenal. If you're wondering just how close of a relationship you make with the staff at Averett - my advisor has a picture of us hanging in her office from my senior pinning, and when going through a hard time in a leadership role, the president wrote me an encouraging handwritten letter. The relationships you make with the staff are exceptional.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2018-02-24T06:03:41.889373Z","guid":"12269862-28ce-48f8-88ec-2ccbae4a7cd1","rating":5},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":2.33}],"photos":{"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-79.413214,36.577273,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-79.413214,36.577273,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.473015873015873,"count":315},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Danville, VA"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/averett-university/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"8c2c8dae-8089-4f57-9750-762bb3535ceb","content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"Lakeland University","type":"College","url":"lakeland-university"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.554},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":21210},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"810-1000"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Sophomore","body":"My overall experience at Lakeland has been an adventure and a half. The teachers and faculty are always willing to lend an ear and a hand when you find the right people and pursue the help you know you need.\nThe opportunities through and at Lakeland are many and I love to explore what's available to me as there seem to be more options popping up every day. But, again, you need to seek them out. The faculty will be willing to present you with what kind of opportunities are available to you, but you have to be the one to pursue them and find out which one is right for you.\nYou also need to keep an eye on is your finances. They won’t pursue you, you need to pursue them periodically in person to see if anything is amiss. Technology is temperamental in ways they might not even be aware of. \nAnother thing I love is their willingness to just talk with you as a person. If you are just looking for a person to talk to and chat with, then they are more than willing if they have the time.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2018-01-01T00:32:08.056758Z","guid":"62ee1167-d4c8-4db2-9805-abba2bbdd21f","rating":4},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":2.33}],"photos":{"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-87.884956,43.841863,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-87.884956,43.841863,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.5238095238095237,"count":336},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Plymouth, WI"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/lakeland-university/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"96b631bd-c67e-4c7a-81fe-1c5b14df55ca","badge":{"display":"Best Colleges in America","ordinal":415,"total":1644,"vanityURL":"best-colleges"},"content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":true,"isPremium":false,"name":"St. Thomas University - Florida","type":"College","url":"st-thomas-university---florida"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.5413},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":18778},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"840-1050"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Freshman","body":"The campus is a bit small, but its easier to get to classes.

Overall I loved my Lincoln College experience and I would recommend this school to anyone.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2017-07-27T03:09:25.186095Z","guid":"93682ec7-8487-4865-843c-d82a5551c98f","rating":5},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":2.33}],"photos":{"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-89.360552,40.157141,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-89.360552,40.157141,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.55,"count":180},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Lincoln, IL"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/lincoln-college/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"e9157e3b-bed7-4d24-b753-8a8e4173d83f","badge":{"display":"Best Colleges in America","ordinal":759,"total":1644,"vanityURL":"best-colleges"},"content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"Brescia University","type":"College","url":"brescia-university"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.4677},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":12181},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"865-1035"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Freshman","body":"My first year at Brescia was actually a very good year for me.

I just finished my sophomore year in Animation and I'm still loving it. The professors are amazing and I feel like I've learned so much at the end of each semester. I can't speak for any other programs, but the Animation program is awesome. I only wish we could cover more subjects. There's not enough time in a year honestly. I wish we were able to take Illustration classes without having to submit a portfolio and get accepted into a second major. Because, for example, we don't get to take classes like Character Design (since it's technically an Illustration class). Overall though, it's a great program with great people. Heads up for freshmen/prospective freshmen, Animation is one of the most competitive majors to get into at this school. It's definitely worth it, but you should know that going in.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2017-05-05T23:50:20.840902Z","guid":"c9cbf9aa-580d-4648-aee0-3db2c8ad4283","rating":5},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":2.66}],"photos":{"default":{"crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/bc293f803a092856d53219e15a8f547e9f638457.jpg","MobileHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/52eeb4837ace23fafea714534746dfa4e89fb355.jpg"},"licenseName":"UNLICENSED"},"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-81.609482,41.509241,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-81.609482,41.509241,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.3737373737373737,"count":198},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Cleveland, OH"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/cleveland-institute-of-art/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"fc0d1ec3-ab59-49a9-8b5c-5761bb43b4d9","content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"Stillman College","type":"College","url":"stillman-college"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.4192},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":12685},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"740-910"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Junior","body":"Stillman College Is Like A Very Big Family, I Love Everyone I Interact With On A Daily.

Additionally, the registrar department was exceptionally helpful and kind.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2017-05-19T12:22:32.540845Z","guid":"4547f917-8f20-45a6-a0f8-c63066be59ba","rating":5},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":1.66}],"photos":{"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-103.186948,32.775496,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-103.186948,32.775496,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.7,"count":30},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Hobbs, NM"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/university-of-the-southwest/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"73a6601c-3bf4-4dd1-8d36-89cfd3f2f3cc","content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"Manor College","type":"College","url":"manor-college"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.8906},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":16566},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"670-890"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Recent Alumnus","body":"I really enjoyed my time at Manor College. The small class sizes offered support and resulted in great networking opportunities. I even had a teacher offer to write me a letter of recommendation when it came time for me to transfer. It was easy to get involved around campus, and being involved led to a great, paid internship opportunity on campus. My internship and classes allowed me to test different career paths and focus on my interests.\r\n\r\nI was thankful for the small campus size, especially in the winter or when I was running late for class.  It was great seeing my friends around campus. \r\n\r\nManor was affordable, supportive, and lots of fun!","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2016-06-17T11:10:47Z","guid":"4c6e2a37-b819-4b9b-8809-eebaa1241570","rating":5},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":3}],"photos":{"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-75.103749,40.086409,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-75.103749,40.086409,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.806451612903226,"count":124},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"2 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Jenkintown, PA"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/manor-college/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"aa9ab826-7609-4f37-8dc3-6d50f44688de","content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":true,"isPremium":false,"name":"Kettering College","type":"College","url":"kettering-college"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.9921},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":20057},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"950-1210"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Junior","body":"Kettering offers smaller classroom sizes and it gives you that enables you to get to know your classmates.
