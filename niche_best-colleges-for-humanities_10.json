And, as a young woman living across the state in a new and unfamiliar environment, I can't appreciate enough how hospitable Pullman and the WSU campus is.

Another pro is that since its a small school, everybody knows everybody for the most part, and everybody is very friendly.

I feel like it really is possible to do whatever makes you happy without being judged. I'm not the typical sorority girl at all, but I am in a sorority here. I also do theatre, and these don't conflict at all! The sojourner truth library is pretty much my second home at this point considering how much time I spend there. The campus is incredibly beautiful and I find myself amazed at it every day.The classrooms are well kept and the professors are all incredible. The work load is rigorous but definitely manageable. The food is not always the best, but after your freshman year when you change your meal plan it gets significantly better. The night life isn't dead as some other posts said, you just have to know of what's going on! There's always either a frat party or a house show going on! On that note, you could also probably get into p&gs bar using a Pokémon card.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2017-12-24T06:19:45.813179Z","guid":"e8c3ad47-85d9-41c9-811e-51da017d5f4f","rating":5},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":3}],"photos":{"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-74.088727,41.737205,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-74.088727,41.737205,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.6121970289288505,"count":1279},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"New Paltz, NY"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/suny-new-paltz/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"940cf13c-0f1d-45fe-8cea-df9f495f4170","badge":{"display":"Best Colleges in America","ordinal":419,"total":1644,"vanityURL":"best-colleges"},"content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"Union College - Nebraska","type":"College","url":"union-college---nebraska"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.635},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":20863},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"876-1183"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Freshman","body":"I am an International Rescue and Relief major and I highly suggest this program to anyone who loves the outdoors, loves emergency care, and wants to serve God with a career of adventure.

I am taking my experiences working alongside my peers in the school newspaper \"State Press\" and student outreach \"Programming and Activities Board\" to learn valuable work ethics for future career skills. As a medical studies major, I still find it important to surround myself with other activities and involvements that are not related to my major. Therefore, the school paper gives me sense of the journalism world and the PAB allows me to explore skills in marketing and event planning.

The smaller class sizes allow for a more intimate setting for students to develop relationships with not just fellow students, but also with their professors. The atmosphere of the entire campus is fresh and welcoming. Personally, it has been very easy getting to know new people whom I have built great relationships with already.

These two organizations - CESA and their LGBT Resource Center - have helped adjust to college life as a first year student.

I’ve many that talk openly and respectfully concerning lgbt issues, diversity issues, and they always end with their discussions inspiration and motivation to dream big and achieve our goals. \n\nIt’d be a dream if I could continue my education there.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2018-06-04T17:43:01.882008Z","guid":"1ffe6e36-cd4f-4fff-b11b-544c393955d0","rating":5},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":4}],"photos":{"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-111.846044,40.762484,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-111.846044,40.762484,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.7160945413618456,"count":3554},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Salt Lake City, UT"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/university-of-utah/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"f62bee41-92e0-48fc-9e57-2e5df171e519","badge":{"display":"Best Colleges in America","ordinal":427,"total":1644,"vanityURL":"best-colleges"},"content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"California State University - Fullerton","type":"College","url":"california-state-university---fullerton"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.4823},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":8170},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"920-1120"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Sophomore","body":"A lot of diversity!

The first thing you want to do when you come to New Mexico Tech is ask some of the older students what teachers are the best for whatever classes you need. The technical part of almost everything at New Mexico Tech has some problems and you want to do as much as possible in person. Otherwise the building(save Torres) are pretty good and sturdy though Torres has some of the newer technology. Socorro itself is fairly barren but it has the base needs of a student body. overall its a good school but you need to know what you are doing before you make major decisions, as soon as you can ask your adviser for some introductory tips as the school does not really inform the students of what they need to do from time to time.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2017-08-16T15:32:03.555652Z","guid":"6a57d1b1-d24c-4db6-bb4e-dfb7955ea33c","rating":4},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":3.66}],"photos":{"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-106.907491,34.066035,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-106.907491,34.066035,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.497098646034816,"count":517},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Socorro, NM"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/new-mexico-institute-of-mining--and--technology/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"9363f26b-5697-496a-9215-704de6c4d5ba","badge":{"display":"Best Colleges in America","ordinal":416,"total":1644,"vanityURL":"best-colleges"},"content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":true,"isPremium":false,"name":"Lipscomb University","type":"College","url":"lipscomb-university"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.6085},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":23426},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"990-1268"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Freshman","body":"The environment is welcoming and the people are so friendly!

I feel as if there are plenty of opportunities for my voice to be heard and to make a difference at this school. Additionally, all the professors I have had the pleasure of taking classes with have been amazing. They are all extremely knowledgeable people who want their students to succeed.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2018-04-17T04:32:39.326071Z","guid":"6b769569-7a8e-4c18-9141-97f2f5ca761f","rating":5},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":3.33}],"photos":{"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-87.830777,42.250456,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-87.830777,42.250456,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.405727923627685,"count":419},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Lake Forest, IL"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/lake-forest-college/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"909c77eb-776f-417e-9230-6919ab231a2b","badge":{"display":"Best Colleges in America","ordinal":181,"total":1644,"vanityURL":"best-colleges"},"content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"University of South Florida","type":"College","url":"university-of-south-florida"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.4663},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":11398},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"1070-1250"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Sophomore","body":"USF has surpassed any expectations I ever had on what life would be at college.  Being a relatively new university there is a lot of pride and youthful energy in the professors, administration, and students. The MSC is a great student hub with a good food court, a restaurant, 4 floors of study or “chilling” areas, offices, event rooms, a theater, a ballroom, a pharmacy, a computer store and many more things. The library has resources from state of the art equipment, macs and PCs, digital media equipment with green screens, quiet study floors, a Starbucks, tutoring center, a writing center and so many more things. Central campus is very pretty and very green, with the MLK plaza in the middle and trees perfectly lined up. The athletics are great including the 3 gyms which include an indoor and an outdoor swimming pools, dance studio, wrestling room, cardio floor, weight floor, indoor track, volleyball, basketball and racquetball courts. We bleed green with a heart of gold. Go bulls!","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2018-02-21T02:47:15.388997Z","guid":"208030e7-bf88-4a84-9e67-a0c1554a41b8","rating":5},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":4}],"photos":{"default":{"author":"akellogg","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/b665cf492df75eb877a2e8ecb007d5ffd0c6c4f3.jpg","MobileHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/7f15ed742bf429487326748c607db9decad1352e.jpg","Thumbnail":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/067674f99d0e50b9de1872e8e1243e97923deae7"},"licenseName":"CC BY ","licenseUrl":"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/2.0/","sourceUrl":"https://www.flickr.com/photos/akellogg/109725514/"},"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-82.415876,28.056647,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-82.415876,28.056647,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.706199460916442,"count":6307},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Tampa, FL"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/university-of-south-florida/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"eab48e37-afef-49f3-a5c9-c3b7b5571e43","badge":{"display":"Best Colleges in America","ordinal":227,"total":1644,"vanityURL":"best-colleges"},"content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"George Mason University","type":"College","url":"george-mason-university"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.8099},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":18032},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"1060-1250"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Alum","body":"I graduated from GMU in May 2017 and I can confidently say that GMU set stepping stones in order for me to pursue my dreams in going into dental school.

GMU gives students a lot of opportunities to grow whether if its from the science field to business to criminology. GMU is known to be one of the most diverse Universities within VA.

From the beginning of my relationship with AU, I have felt special and valued. The Admissions Department is superb - campus visits run smoothly, student ambassadors are friendly and helpful, Admissions Counselors are great and ready to answer any and every question. Campus life is great - first year residences are not too different from any other university BUT the free laundry is a major bonus! Also, free mini fridge/microwave units are available in every room. Printing services are more than adequate - 500 free pages per year (I only used about 200 this year!). Dining services are adequate and they're always looking to improve. Professors are superb - open door policy makes visiting offices much more inviting and professors are so accessible. Classes are informative, relevant, and challenging. Professors will work with you in any way to help you understand information and better yourself as a student.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2017-05-30T20:17:16.312907Z","guid":"e5fd8217-d842-49e2-925d-31e4d3fb8067","rating":5},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":4}],"photos":{"default":{"crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/26b4893272f51e5d291d182138739f8efee4f49f.jpg","MobileHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/210e95dc27dd5bc3c2747890c9feba4ecb98fc85.jpg"},"licenseName":"UNLICENSED"},"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-96.738507,43.525939,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-96.738507,43.525939,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.7058823529411766,"count":391},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Sioux Falls, SD"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/augustana-university/#scatterplot"}}]}
