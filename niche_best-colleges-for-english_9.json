All of the professors I've had so far except one, are very helpful, and you are able to establish a more personal relationship with your professors due to the small class sizes. All of your professors will know your name, and they really care about helping you individually, how you are doing, and care about making sure you succeed, especially in SIS (department of International Studies). Another pro is that since its a small school, everybody knows everybody for the most part, and everybody is very friendly. For this reason, its also easy to make and find friends, and you'll see the usual students you see around the usual times you see them when you go to the cafeteria, the lair, the gym, or the library.\nThe Freshmen dorms, the walls are VERY thin, you literally could hear everything so it could get annoying if your floor or neighbors are loud and you want to sleep, study, or just want some peace and quiet.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2018-06-02T18:05:05.687909Z","guid":"2b702cec-ed70-418f-b294-d8d325c942f7","rating":4},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":3.66}],"photos":{"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-121.307296,37.980624,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-121.307296,37.980624,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.5813544415127527,"count":1137},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Stockton, CA"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/university-of-the-pacific/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"09fd47cb-a5b8-4e7a-a790-542d9b9b729c","badge":{"display":"Best Colleges for English in America","ordinal":213,"total":647,"vanityURL":"best-colleges-for-english"},"content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"California State University - Long Beach","type":"College","url":"california-state-university---long-beach"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.3189},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":9867},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"930-1160"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Senior","body":"California State University, Long Beach is a very diverse university with much to offer for example there are many majors offered, clubs, sports, internship opportunities and a variety of options to further your education.

However, a wonderful pro of this is that this brings the students closer together.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2017-05-24T12:30:03.183186Z","guid":"a55cab85-a0c9-42bc-a5a3-b1cffc39bfa9","rating":4},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":3.33}],"photos":{"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-76.87521,40.79774,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-76.87521,40.79774,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.4993197278911565,"count":735},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Selinsgrove, PA"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/susquehanna-university/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"ad74490c-c545-420d-80c6-46146daaf5a9","badge":{"display":"Best Colleges for English in America","ordinal":219,"total":647,"vanityURL":"best-colleges-for-english"},"content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"Pacific University","type":"College","url":"pacific-university"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.788},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":30130},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"1010-1230"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Senior","body":"I have loved my time at Pacific University.

There are always events going on that are generally open to the students and the food at the Shoebox and Underground is simply fantastic.

Class styles are all pretty similar, with classrooms generally being of the same design across the board, with obvious variations for labs.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2016-07-20T16:23:52Z","guid":"a1845130-46dd-4084-b242-b5a26fb598af","rating":4},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":4}],"photos":{"default":{"crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/afc842363afa32b406a48ef9d159fdf3842f80f9.jpg","MobileHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/a58cba0c6eed68533ae9635841ad36edeb9a465e.jpg"},"licenseName":"UNLICENSED"},"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-79.435737,37.790644,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-79.435737,37.790644,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.3535911602209945,"count":181},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Lexington, VA"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/virginia-military-institute/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"7cdaccaa-4888-4f76-9352-28998c237e6c","badge":{"display":"Best Colleges for English in America","ordinal":233,"total":647,"vanityURL":"best-colleges-for-english"},"content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"Wittenberg University","type":"College","url":"wittenberg-university"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.7832},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":25325},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"1040-1240"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Freshman","body":"I really love this University!

Anyone and everyone is welcomed to be themselves regardless of their affiliations! The school does a fantastic job of making students proud of their school with the beautiful campus and enthusiastic culture. You find that CU alumns are all around the country, eager to return your \"Go Buffs!\" with one of their own. Your college experience is what you make of it. You are free to either party all the time, work-hard, or find a healthy medium. Boulder students know how to get involved in the outdoors so it is not difficult to find someone to bike with, hike with, or relax on lawns in the sunshine with. CU looks massive on paper, but it immediately felt like a second home.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2017-08-15T03:10:29.479301Z","guid":"aae0d57f-b36f-46ee-99b0-f065fdfb55d3","rating":5},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":4}],"photos":{"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-105.267061,40.004415,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-105.267061,40.004415,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.678503245513555,"count":2619},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Boulder, CO"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/university-of-colorado---boulder/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"0b02a351-0e8f-4107-94dc-0a7e76bcba9d","badge":{"display":"Best Colleges for English in America","ordinal":235,"total":647,"vanityURL":"best-colleges-for-english"},"content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"Ursinus College","type":"College","url":"ursinus-college"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.8242},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":31537},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"1060-1280"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Freshman","body":"Ursinus was a school that I applied at last minute to and wasn't entirely sure about my decision. However,  I have been pleasantly surprised over and over again here. The professors are extremely qualified in their fields and the small class size makes it super easy to get a more personal and engaging learning experience. The student body is diverse not only in their ethnic background but also socioeconomically, politically and their interest. I am a member of the swimming and track team along with balancing a double major and a radio show. The passion among the students here, especially the studnet-atheletes is contagious, and it wasn't long before I found myself passionate not only about my course but also my studies.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2017-02-15T23:50:07.468826Z","guid":"708322dd-dd11-441e-b17c-925f2d025d4c","rating":5},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":3.33}],"photos":{"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-75.455654,40.19405,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-75.455654,40.19405,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.548463356973995,"count":423},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Collegeville, PA"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/ursinus-college/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"d2157cb0-0d0e-46d5-86fa-8f3e244c955d","badge":{"display":"Best Colleges for English in America","ordinal":237,"total":647,"vanityURL":"best-colleges-for-english"},"content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"Monmouth College","type":"College","url":"monmouth-college"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.5206},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":18612},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"860-1090"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Freshman","body":"The school is very good. The professors care a lot about their students and how well they do. It is a liberal arts college meaning that they focus on teaching the students the importance of learning multiple subjects rather than having expertise in only one area. The school has the Integrated Studies course that everyone is required to take. Freshmen take \"Introduction to Liberal Arts,\" sophomores take \"Global Perspectives,\" juniors take \"Reflections,\" and seniors take a course on \"Citizenship.\" These courses help the students become aware of their communities and get them involved in helping to make the world a more welcoming and overall a better place. Because the school is in a very small town, it is not as diverse as other schools closer to the cities and big towns. However, everyone is welcoming and very helpful. They emphasize the importance of helping one another and the professors are excellent in helping their students achieve and reach their highest potential.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2018-01-20T05:12:47.114922Z","guid":"0cd35397-14df-4fdf-ac0f-35ddc8617049","rating":4},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":3}],"photos":{"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-90.637909,40.91459,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-90.637909,40.91459,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.4891944990176817,"count":509},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Monmouth, IL"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/monmouth-college/#scatterplot"}}]}
