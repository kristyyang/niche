After visiting various colleges, I was most impressed with what Mount Saint Mary College was able to offer me. In four years, I will be graduating with a degree in Education Technology, which is second to none and have a wonderful job on campus. Throughout my time here, I plan to stay active and meet new people from all over the world. I believe that the career center will help me get a great internship, which will give me more experience into the field I'm striving for. If you want to come to a small liberal arts college where you can gain a quality education and have four years of fun, Mount Saint Mary is the place to be. So why not come here when the tuition is affordable and is located halfway between Albany and the city? It will make it a whole lot easier to commute!","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2016-09-12T19:48:45.838534Z","guid":"4e71bd6f-097e-469c-a69b-f1a310d0ce51","rating":5},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":2}],"photos":{"default":{"crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/937995b1ac33496bb9fceccb2a6321326903cc33.jpg","MobileHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/d261b325ad9f04d3386900c702cc11d4d3b33547.jpg"},"licenseName":"UNLICENSED"},"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-74.012906,41.511212,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-74.012906,41.511212,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.4317180616740086,"count":454},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Newburgh, NY"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/mount-saint-mary-college---new-york/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"5a7c4edd-4bc3-4f74-bc35-03477c8e0759","content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":true,"isPremium":false,"name":"Millikin University","type":"College","url":"millikin-university"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.638},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":21935},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"910-1080"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Alum","body":"I would not trade my 4 years at MU for anything! I absolutely loved it there even though Decatur can be a sketchy area, this campus is beautiful and old which makes it rich in history and tradition. The student body is decently diverse. The theatre program is amazing as well as the music program. The faculty truly cares for every student. The small campus gives you the close knit family vibe. The townies can be ratchet though. Another fun fact is that it is haunted!

The people here are awesome. If you want a place where you can walk across campus and know 10 out of the 20 people that you just walked past, this is the place for you. The professors care about you and your education, and about what you are doing as a student to further your experience in the classroom. Campus is small, and the closest 'big town' is about ten minutes away, but you can always find things to do and people to do them with if you try hard enough. If you don't think a big school is for you, then SAU might be a good option! Our CORE program does a really good job of getting new students hooked up with a student mentor and a group of fellow classmates from the first day on campus. You get to grow with this group and you might find that some of those people will be your good friends.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2017-01-23T21:51:30.56762Z","guid":"7da6c56d-c755-40aa-ab52-6dfe796b878f","rating":4},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":2.66}],"photos":{"default":{"crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/cfbd055fdf88698a3021c1fb1c275238f3a3cd8d.jpg","MobileHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/04ce8326585f3ef8285079f8ba1d89d66e5fc71f.jpg"},"licenseName":"UNLICENSED"},"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-84.551918,42.206233,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-84.551918,42.206233,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.6422764227642275,"count":738},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Spring Arbor, MI"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/spring-arbor-university/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"54488b79-b29b-4117-8954-0d1508e88ba1","content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":true,"isPremium":false,"name":"Quincy University","type":"College","url":"quincy-university"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.6623},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":18949},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"910-1160"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Niche User","body":"Quincy University has small beautiful campus and honestly, I like that.

I didn't have any outstanding reason for picking Longwood, but I'm glad I did and I wouldn't pick any other college, go Lancers!","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2016-12-30T16:15:24.644149Z","guid":"2139168f-6755-4d2e-9ef6-63961e2f701b","rating":4},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":3}],"photos":{"default":{"crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/bffb4ff8b5c5f26fba87d4953382e15ae7ed6883.jpg","MobileHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/101440619de72036636c567864ad0f1d238a1af7.jpg"},"licenseName":"UNLICENSED"},"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-78.395789,37.301073,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-78.395789,37.301073,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.512596899224806,"count":1032},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Farmville, VA"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/longwood-university/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"24927aec-aa48-4601-b7f4-51c47333e150","content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"Minot State University","type":"College","url":"minot-state-university"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.5981},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":9987},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"920-1090"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Junior","body":"Minot State University is an awesome university with a small, close knit classrooms and a fun, interactive college activities.

There’s a lot of diversity at Farmingdale, such as career choices, culture, and lifestyle . Farmingdale urges you to express exactly who you are. There are many clubs that allow you to really liberate yourself and express how you feel, what you like and that you are supported no matter what. I met a lot of people at very different stages in their lives. Some were like me, who went straight from high school into college. Others were returning to college or starting college for the first time ever who had graduated from high school years ago.

The beautiful campus, excellent faculty, and overall atmosphere come together to form a holistic environment in which a student feels motivated to be better.  Though, it goes far beyond the simple fact that the school is building new facilities...any school can do that. Rather, its the culture that exists where the school itself is constantly striving to be better, which is why our mascot, the pioneer, is fitting. SHU is constantly pioneering what a college can be. Being a part of this truly makes a difference in the students' college experience. This is the ONLY SCHOOL that I visited that had this type of environment.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2017-12-30T16:16:18.292381Z","guid":"32d59c14-d525-4eaf-bf9c-00e3d6bbf1eb","rating":5},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":2.66}],"photos":{"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-73.24461,41.221548,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-73.24461,41.221548,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.3552780930760497,"count":881},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Fairfield, CT"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/sacred-heart-university/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"0972131f-a656-411c-bb0b-6d2750d8b031","content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":true,"isPremium":false,"name":"Clarke University","type":"College","url":"clarke-university"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.6493},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":23787},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"856-1060"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Niche User","body":"I really loved the location of the college.  it is located in Dubuque near the bluffs and a river, and is also about 5 minutes away from downtown.  The campus itself is very old, but is newly renovated which gives it that antique feel.  It used to be an all women college, but has recently been opened up to men.  The architecture of the buildings is spectacular, and even more impressive, the school has underground tunnels!  I'm going for nursing, and the program guarantees you're out in four years with a degree which is extremely satisfying.  There are also a lot of hospitals near the campus which makes it super easy to complete my clinicals.  The only problem I have with the overall atmosphere is that it is still a blossoming campus, so it is quite small.  I'm from a small town so I'm familiar with the small-town feel, but it would be nice to be apart of a campus with more students at some point in the future.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2017-01-30T15:38:10.925906Z","guid":"6170eace-605b-49ef-814a-a23e385a18af","rating":4},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":2.66}],"photos":{"default":{"crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/fab1d8508676876a6778f15f5ba87c8d6fa832da.jpg","MobileHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/4ad0c7b5da1160250f3a0006ba1d9c92fc7264c7.jpg"},"licenseName":"UNLICENSED"},"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-90.691512,42.508619,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-90.691512,42.508619,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.592833876221498,"count":307},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Dubuque, IA"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/clarke-university/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"d335bd65-4c09-4264-a8cc-d145ba0db1a3","content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"Rockford University","type":"College","url":"rockford-university"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.5443},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":23289},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"950-1210"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Senior","body":"I love the teacher-student ratio: the department that aligns with your major is like a second family!

Being a part of UNM has given me unforgettable memories, close friends and fun experiences.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2018-04-17T01:21:56.060697Z","guid":"451c1596-1fe1-4cbb-9206-0efc9e28370c","rating":5},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":3}],"photos":{"default":{"crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/24131ce06dea388526bedc6ad307882eb9da3219.jpg","MobileHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/062851d99af8e29d786a585ae1faa1c045b34c54.jpg"},"licenseName":"UNLICENSED"},"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-106.620155,35.083868,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-106.620155,35.083868,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.474596896866444,"count":3287},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Albuquerque, NM"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/university-of-new-mexico/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"24e0178b-a7d3-4b00-962e-c302019d6804","content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"Regis College","type":"College","url":"regis-college"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.9695},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":27777},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"840-1060"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Junior","body":"After graduating from another school and attending Regis College to complete my degree, Regis has been very welcoming and has provided me with a great deal of guidance. I would like to become a PA in the future and Regis College has provided me with all the tools I will need to continue my career path. I am very grateful for the opportunities that have been presented to me in my time at Regis. I will also be able to complete requirements for my future career at Regis. The resources that Regis provides their students sets them up for success and ensures that their learning is a priority. The campus is very nice and even has a Dunkin'  Donuts on site.  They really care about your success, and they help you in every way they can. My experience at Regis has been amazing, and I am very thankful for the support they have provided me with.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2018-04-28T14:35:40.374614Z","guid":"13b8c48d-cd05-44c9-83c9-9f2dae9af658","rating":5},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":2.33}],"photos":{"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-71.309126,42.351105,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-71.309126,42.351105,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.287581699346405,"count":306},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Weston, MA"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/regis-college/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"c064c235-6c23-4089-a57e-c2d31d9d6621","content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"Norwich University","type":"College","url":"norwich-university"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.6998},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":28242},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"930-1160"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Freshman","body":"Small university where you know almost everybody. Core is very important and most think they are better than every civilian. Fortunately, not all core members are like this. They have a bomb architecture program and nursing program. The other programs dont get as much credit as these two do. The professors are strange. Some are very strict for their classes and others could careless about what you do. I have had the chance to have awesome professors though that do care about your experience and grade. Also the food is terrible. The library and writing center are amazing and they are willing to help you with anything you need.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2018-04-27T03:28:29.274513Z","guid":"b0c81b97-c271-475d-8dc4-3a3b1da3f97a","rating":4},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":3}],"photos":{"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-72.660129,44.139402,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-72.660129,44.139402,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.2172949002217295,"count":451},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Northfield, VT"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/norwich-university/#scatterplot"}}]}
