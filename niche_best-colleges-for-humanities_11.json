Many of the professors here have gone above and beyond to accommodate for any questions and concerns that I may have. Going to an out-of-state school is very nerve wracking at first, but I am glad that I picked Elon. Elon has become my home away from home in more ways than one and I often find myself counting down the days till I am back on campus. Elon's curriculum can be very intense at times; however, I am getting an education based on the work that I put in. One complaint that I have about Elon is paying for laundry. The cost adds up very quickly and is often frustrating that I have to pay so that I am able to wear clean clothes to class. However, that is the only negative that I have so it doesn't outweigh all of the positive things that Elon has to offer me.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2018-04-19T13:43:25.478388Z","guid":"7f30ce7a-7427-4e25-bd99-8dd8702c2318","rating":5},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":3.66}],"photos":{"default":{"crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/9594d06e83a657e2511ddfd70641a213c2851460.jpg","MobileHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/42f3524b81e18c8a4e7a393354dccf1b6a43db44.jpg"},"licenseName":"UNLICENSED"},"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-79.505632,36.104149,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-79.505632,36.104149,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.5380818053596617,"count":1418},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Elon, NC"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/elon-university/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"860d91fd-a1b3-435f-948f-aa473e2c0493","badge":{"display":"Best Colleges in America","ordinal":499,"total":1644,"vanityURL":"best-colleges"},"content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":true,"isPremium":false,"name":"Spalding University","type":"College","url":"spalding-university"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.503},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":20859},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"883-1106"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Sophomore","body":"The students are VERY diverse, especially when it comes to sexuality.

The food is excellent, Godfather's Pizza, Chinese, Latin American, Sushi, Burgers, and buffet styled mess halls are a good indication of the different food at Creighton.  The dorms are a little on the dated side, yet they have modern amenities.  The older buildings really gives the place a theme and a warm glow.

The campus is located a couple blocks out of downtown Minneapolis, so it is a beautiful setting.  The school also has an extremely good business program, with many students able to find jobs immediately out of school because of the connections and skills they learn in the School of Business.

It is a school that not only excels with excellent professors and campus life, but a school that takes your purpose and morphs it into a future.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2018-02-22T20:37:12.806526Z","guid":"a6824192-ced9-4bce-b046-6315a01728c5","rating":5},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":3.33}],"photos":{"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-117.900911,33.662686,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-117.900911,33.662686,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.759305210918114,"count":806},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Costa Mesa, CA"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/vanguard-university-of-southern-california/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"e2c23d77-a108-41a1-b566-05fcb2e742c6","badge":{"display":"Best Colleges in America","ordinal":162,"total":1644,"vanityURL":"best-colleges"},"content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"Oklahoma State University","type":"College","url":"oklahoma-state-university"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.7452},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":13951},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"970-1200"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Sophomore","body":"All of my first year professors were very kind and knowledgeable about the subjects they taught. There are always tons of activities going on around campus, it's impossible to have nothing to do if you take part in clubs or events going on around campus. The other students on campus are nice, and the atmosphere is very warm and welcoming in general. The campus police are very diligent and make sure all of the students are safe, and there's even an app for safety on campus! Oklahoma State shows a genuine care for their students even though the school is decently populated at this point. The only issue I really had was parking, as it's hard to find spots sometimes.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2018-05-14T15:33:04.954659Z","guid":"485b7103-f16d-43ea-8ab7-0bc644346795","rating":4},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":4}],"photos":{"default":{"author":"xtrah","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/b9224fb93089ca7d42fae4223ef7577cdb407977.jpg","MobileHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/b8d4739f974f538905a82d00c68b34b716cecb55.jpg","Thumbnail":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/b03f3ed6319829479583c2e5672b93380a5c3787"},"licenseName":"CC BY ","licenseUrl":"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/2.0/","sourceUrl":"https://www.flickr.com/photos/xtrah/5737920776/"},"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-97.069743,36.123085,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-97.069743,36.123085,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.8173395102581074,"count":3022},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Stillwater, OK"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/oklahoma-state-university/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"37968f58-1749-4a66-b912-81cd6f3d38de","badge":{"display":"Best Colleges in America","ordinal":463,"total":1644,"vanityURL":"best-colleges"},"content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"Lancaster Bible College","type":"College","url":"lancaster-bible-college"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.6739},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":19732},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"900-1120"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Freshman","body":"LBC is a great school!  I am part of a gap year program there called One Life, which I would absolutely recommend to a friend.  It has allowed me to travel to Israel, the Grand Canyon, and countless other places along with living in a community type environment and earning 30 college credits.  As for LBC it self, it is a smaller, Christian school in Lancaster, PA.   LBC is made up of like-minded individuals that are pursuing Christ.  In addition, although this campus is very small (with plenty of room to grow), every part of it is gorgeous.  And with Lancaster city close by, there are countless options to be entertained.  One change I hope LBC will make is to grow their campus.  Although their sports teams perform at a high level for a D3 school, they only have one basketball court that must be shared with other sports teams throughout the week.  They also should have a larger more weight-lifting facility.  Ultimately, I would recommend LBC/One Life to anyone searching for a college.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2018-03-17T15:52:50.231215Z","guid":"267e3e15-6d41-4c7c-9ca4-d3310d39b3ff","rating":4},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":3.33}],"photos":{"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-76.287781,40.074375,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-76.287781,40.074375,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":4.016326530612245,"count":245},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Lancaster, PA"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/lancaster-bible-college/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"40cb6410-efd9-45a6-a994-c4b2dec0ff40","badge":{"display":"Best Colleges in America","ordinal":426,"total":1644,"vanityURL":"best-colleges"},"content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":true,"isPremium":false,"name":"Winthrop University","type":"College","url":"winthrop-university"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.685},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":16702},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"910-1135"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Niche User","body":"My uncle introduced and encouraged me to apply to Winthrop University. I refused to research the school because I did not believe Winthrop was the place for me; however,  I toured the campus about three years later.  One reason why is because of the campus's size. In my opinion, Winthrop is a smaller Clemson. Furthermore, the student ratio is 15:1. Another reason is the convivial atmosphere. Winthrop's faculties are organized, easy to find, and productive. For example, the student center has over four different restaurants and the workers are nice. The staff occupying these places such as the recreation center, bookstore, and admissions office are welcoming, helpful, and friendly. Last but not least, Winthrop has the graphic design program which is my intended major. Thus, I have been accepted into Winthrop University and I am looking forward to finish in two years. I love Winthrop.
