Tisch has given me so much valuable experience on student sets and in class that I am sure I could not have received anywhere else. There are so many classes to choose from in every aspect of filmmaking, which gives students so many skills that can be marketable when looking for a job after graduation.

With Hollywood just down a few miles and the Santa Monica beach around, one can expect pleasant surprises almost every time!

If you're looking for a private school, and want more of a quiet suburban feel, then LMU might be your place.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2018-03-30T20:43:27.53187Z","guid":"4290c19c-2342-498d-a9aa-06552a88b019","rating":4},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":4}],"photos":{"default":{"author":"adangarcia","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/a38dca15400c33a551571deac73e2f1969890901.jpg","MobileHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/00a04b52e8930e528883d75cf7a194b035222d1c.jpg","Thumbnail":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/2ad218cbd1f66c682311e9ee5c77477fef195c01"},"licenseName":"CC BY ","licenseUrl":"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/2.0/","sourceUrl":"https://www.flickr.com/photos/adangarcia/2810418976/"},"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-118.415655,33.970633,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-118.415655,33.970633,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.6884389288047026,"count":1531},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Los Angeles, CA"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/loyola-marymount-university/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"031491d5-5fa9-44fd-8996-98b1888c7f03","badge":{"display":"Best Colleges for Film and Photography in America","ordinal":8,"total":157,"vanityURL":"best-colleges-for-film"},"content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"Rhode Island School of Design","type":"College","url":"rhode-island-school-of-design"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.3412},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":39389},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"1080-1340"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Freshman","body":"As a Freshman at RISD, my perspective of RISD as a whole is limited. However, from what I've experienced, it's been overwhelmingly positive. The professors here are all skilled in a different areas, which makes Foundation year a very broad and interdisciplinary year. Indeed, students who want to focus on only one area of study find it tedious, but I found it very eye-opening. After all, I got the chance to work with mediums from paint to wood, which I've never touched. One truly exemplary part of RISD is the dining: they're very open to all types of eaters, and are open to change. If the food doesn't cover a wide enough spectrum, then there are methods of contacting the MET in order to change that. The MET staff are very kind and friendly, always open to conversation.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2018-03-29T09:04:16.437004Z","guid":"b4194fa2-89c2-4a15-ba50-180c1fb093e9","rating":4},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":4}],"photos":{"default":{"author":"woneffe","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/f7f8cd4dd5a6cb929c475a4063377a4266243e93.jpg","MobileHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/73b237c1328616a2c9b3ffcd5b0f0a128961bce3.jpg","Thumbnail":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/efa21c864eada53983b699012757771cd3bad7a8"},"licenseName":"CC BY-SA","licenseUrl":"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/","sourceUrl":"https://www.flickr.com/photos/woneffe/4048957944/"},"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-71.407692,41.825935,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-71.407692,41.825935,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.7114754098360656,"count":305},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Providence, RI"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/rhode-island-school-of-design/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"4744a64a-1a81-4d56-b0c0-532f099fddc6","badge":{"display":"Best Colleges for Film and Photography in America","ordinal":9,"total":157,"vanityURL":"best-colleges-for-film"},"content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"Emerson College","type":"College","url":"emerson-college"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.4806},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":39263},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"1120-1330"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Alum","body":"My four years at Emerson gave me great friends, helped shape my worldview, and greatly contributed to my career trajectory.

The studios looked very professional, and the security system is very fast and trustworthy.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2017-03-13T10:26:57.978533Z","guid":"4f1ab24f-5c39-4238-8c64-278153beb856","rating":5},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":3}],"photos":{"default":{"crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/a9c2d9435dc59eb1cce0c74b55d761176de4469b.jpg","MobileHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/0321a92de8191189baaa4627700f6a6bdc8ac853.jpg"},"licenseName":"UNLICENSED"},"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-73.962149,40.691154,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-73.962149,40.691154,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.4912985274431056,"count":747},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Brooklyn, NY"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/pratt-institute/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"b1b6ff67-4938-4b0c-9645-8ae03caeb22f","badge":{"display":"Best Colleges for Film and Photography in America","ordinal":25,"total":157,"vanityURL":"best-colleges-for-film"},"content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"Southern Methodist University","type":"College","url":"southern-methodist-university"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.4892},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":37499},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"1220-1410"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Junior","body":"SMU has provided a unique establishment of community in order for all students to feel welcome! However, the diversity presented within the school is quite low. There are sparse percentages of Latinos, Hispanics, African Americans, and Asians. Even though this is the case, the gradual enrollment of multiple international students does decrease the evident ethnic gap among students. Additonally, many of the teachers and remainder of the faculty are friendly and supportive for all students to succeed. With constant reminders regarding the A-LEC center and its workshops, students are free to ask questions from a variety of multiple disciplines to tutors who are readily available!

For a small school, after a semester I am still meeting people I've never seen before (maybe I'm just unobservant),  and it seems students still find themselves making new friends even senior year. It's very high school socially, perhaps because of size, but the cliques aren't as intimidating. \nI have enjoyed classes immensely, not that I've had so much experience with them yet. I would recommend contacting professors early and often– twice I have contacted professors with interest in a particular course and they have just enrolled me! This doesn't seem like a super frequent practice, but do all you can  to get on waitlists as soon as possible because enrolling in courses is surprisingly difficult. Introducing yourself in person to prospective professors goes a long way.

Some are quirky, athletic, political, or musical, but they are a great mix and you may be surprised at the friendships you make. There is always something to do on campus, and it is easy to get to Cleveland if you miss urban life. \n\nAthletics continue to improve, with several conference championships.
