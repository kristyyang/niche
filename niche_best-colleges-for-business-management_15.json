I was always a very introverted person who never liked to go out, but after witnessing all the activities and organizations on campus, I couldn't help bursting through my introverted tendencies. There's an organization or an event for everyone's taste and the brotherhood that we preach here is real, so be prepared to have support in every way, shape, and form. I will always see Morehouse as my\n2nd family and that's a feeling you won't get from any other institution.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2018-05-12T05:54:44.56491Z","guid":"585cc978-7745-4062-91ff-303e50405c4d","rating":4},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":3}],"photos":{"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-84.415156,33.74793,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-84.415156,33.74793,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.463448275862069,"count":725},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Atlanta, GA"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/morehouse-college/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"7019670d-b587-42c9-bd29-6fc564a8d2bf","badge":{"display":"Best Colleges for Business in America","ordinal":382,"total":1020,"vanityURL":"best-colleges-for-business"},"content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":true,"isPremium":false,"name":"Maranatha Baptist University","type":"College","url":"maranatha-baptist-university"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.6809},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":18815},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"875-1125"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Freshman","body":"I love the people that are involved with making MBU great!

I have only spent one year at Siena so far, but I could not have imagined the transition from high school to college to have gone any smoother. The school itself is such a great size, with tons of incredible resources. The people at Siena are some of the friendliest, kindest, and most down-to-earth people you will ever meet, and I honestly feel like they are my family already! Siena is amazing.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2018-05-21T19:39:01.307962Z","guid":"896073fe-3422-432e-bb96-e42fc830d200","rating":5},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":3}],"photos":{"default":{"crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/d0d60b02e43a44f1a058cf704ba0edeb9b260bd1.jpg","MobileHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/961789683552c16d2c038552d7e912f7d9cef88e.jpg"},"licenseName":"UNLICENSED"},"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-73.75153,42.718586,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-73.75153,42.718586,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.4985250737463125,"count":678},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Loudonville, NY"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/siena-college/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"1367e184-51b3-4aee-acb4-704cb075a586","badge":{"display":"Best Colleges for Business in America","ordinal":390,"total":1020,"vanityURL":"best-colleges-for-business"},"content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":true,"isPremium":true,"name":"Northwest University","type":"College","url":"northwest-university"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.9339},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":21536},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"942-1174"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Freshman","body":"I am enrolled in the online church partnership program!

The Jesuit education provided by Le Moyne is thorough and all around excellent. I also commuted to Le Moyne and I found that my professors were always understanding and accomodating if I were ever in the situation where I wouldn’t be able to attend class, such as weather conditions and other external forces that I wouldn’t be able to control.

Whether that’s through freshman activities, great professors, or just awesome, nice people, Concordia is extremely welcoming to everyone and anyone. Oh and I can’t forget to mention how awesome free parking at the university is! \nI would, however, change the policies pertaining to the hours that boys/girls can be in each other’s dorms. I think that this policy should be different because by the time we get to college, we are adults. We should be capable of making our own mature decisions pertaining to the opposite gender. \nThe smallness of Concordia is one of its positives and negatives. It is a good thing because of how easy it is to know your fellow students, athletes, faculty, and even the president of the university. The negative of the smallness of the school is that everyone knows everything, word travels very fast.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2018-01-03T16:43:38.630766Z","guid":"d8e0a378-269a-4587-8b87-0fb383cd5cc8","rating":4},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":3}],"photos":{"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-97.089054,40.914853,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-97.089054,40.914853,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.672316384180791,"count":354},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Seward, NE"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/concordia-university---nebraska/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"fe7ad8c6-9d8a-4852-adf5-c5e38a38e3b3","badge":{"display":"Best Colleges for Business in America","ordinal":399,"total":1020,"vanityURL":"best-colleges-for-business"},"content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":true,"isPremium":false,"name":"Central College","type":"College","url":"central-college"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.7343},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":22695},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"950-1290"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Sophomore","body":"I enjoy the wonderful student-to-teacher ration at Central College (approximately 10:1) and the various resources available for both academic and personal health, such as the writing center and free mental health counseling services.
