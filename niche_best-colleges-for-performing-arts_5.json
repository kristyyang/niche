I love the freedom, readily available tutorial and help centers, resources, dining options, and the island in the middle of the lake.

Mental health is an actual concern for them, and they have free counseling services too! So is physical health, and they have a clinic you can get your prescriptions or a check up at.

It's definitely a college to look out for when applying.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2018-03-07T17:57:21.237414Z","guid":"b8c8114c-6e1b-4488-b9e1-9e29aca415e1","rating":5},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":3.33}],"photos":{"default":{"crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/125c76ed14edcf7752b8e71770450afff7b4ad46.jpg","MobileHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/c452fcefe2a286f8f6e44558bee4d6f67606d2d7.jpg"},"licenseName":"UNLICENSED"},"mapbox_header":{"crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-73.815387,40.737771,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-73.815387,40.737771,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"UNLICENSED"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.446254071661238,"count":921},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Queens, NY"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/cuny-queens-college/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"0668ba19-7f65-41ce-81b2-24b022b64b2f","content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"Washington College","type":"College","url":"washington-college"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.4903},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":32658},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"1040-1280"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Senior","body":"After touring eight other schools, Washington College was stop number 9 and after that day I knew I didn't need to see another school, I was home!

Whether your passion is in athletics, student government, theatre or anything else on our long list of available opportunities you will find a home at WAC. \n\nOn the side of academics the professors are the ones who deserve so much credit. They will go out of their way to ensure that your are living up to your true potential. With class sizes of about 16-17 students it's hard to hide in the corner or skip class without your professor noticing. Trust me, this is a good thing. If you get the chance to visit campus be sure to swing your department of interest and talk to any of the professors there!

The amount of scholarship offered to out-of-state students is amazing and helps combat the high cost.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2018-04-10T19:02:12.236272Z","guid":"040f2331-f244-42bf-9627-e453172c9bff","rating":5},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":4}],"photos":{"default":{"crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/72d468d49a692298481d0fd444598807a8e348ce.jpg","MobileHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/e8b3f3c3a38131d336c2949319f659484199b5ba.jpg"},"licenseName":"UNLICENSED"},"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-87.545766,33.2144,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-87.545766,33.2144,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.8969047038752134,"count":4103},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Tuscaloosa, AL"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/the-university-of-alabama/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"c3818153-d13b-4ca0-8c85-6acd3c6ff94a","content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"Savannah College of Art & Design","type":"College","url":"savannah-college-of-art--and--design"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.7171},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":40856},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"950-1190"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Sophomore","body":"SCAD has an amazing campus with many hardworking teachers. You'll definitely get out what you put into your work/projects!\nHowever, there are some minor concerns about the school I've experienced. While the campus is gorgeous and spread out, around the dorms there's little to no cleanup. SCAD outdoor elevators seem to grow sludge and a foul stench after the first week or two of school. Lastly, while nearly all of the teachers are an absolute delight to learn from, there are a few that push their political/social bias onto the students or aren't quite able to teach nor put in real effort.\nOther than that, if I was a graduating high school again and needed to pick a college, I would definitely pick SCAD all over again.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2018-03-30T21:33:23.500956Z","guid":"9e550866-7e32-4919-8590-27a6c04ee2a5","rating":5},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":3}],"photos":{"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-81.093905,32.072966,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-81.093905,32.072966,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.7593803786574873,"count":2905},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Savannah, GA"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/savannah-college-of-art--and--design/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"09fd47cb-a5b8-4e7a-a790-542d9b9b729c","content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"California State University - Long Beach","type":"College","url":"california-state-university---long-beach"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.3189},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":9867},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"930-1160"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Senior","body":"California State University, Long Beach is a very diverse university with much to offer for example there are many majors offered, clubs, sports, internship opportunities and a variety of options to further your education.
