Every department is successful here and I do not know of many small town colleges that are strong in every single major. You'll even see plenty of furry creatures such as the squirrels, ducks, geese, and swans! Plus, chicken tenders from World of Wings Cafe.

There is a good ratio of professors to students, so you feel like you can get some extra help from the professors if you need it. The professors are very nice as well (at least the ones I've had). They welcome questions, and help you to the best of their ability. The layout of the school is really nice and simple, as there are multiple ways to get to most places. It was a bit intimidating at first, but I quickly got used to the way the school is laid out. As for the classes, they are pretty good. There is a wide range of subjects that are offered, so odds are that you will find the types of classes you are looking for. During the time between classes, you can sit in one of the many comfortable couches and chairs in various parts of the school. The food is good too, if you're wondering about that. Just beware of the Freshman 15 if you eat from the buffet!","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2017-02-22T22:30:04.713927Z","guid":"63dc225c-dd46-461a-9e7b-e561948c70d2","rating":4},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":2.33}],"photos":{"default":{"crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/117cc499cfc90e54fdfd1a5f35b8a1c8b06b0181.jpg","MobileHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/c82084655fd117d337c185e9a36426957da2561b.jpg"},"licenseName":"UNLICENSED"},"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-95.75983,44.455023,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-95.75983,44.455023,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.4014084507042255,"count":284},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Marshall, MN"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/southwest-minnesota-state-university/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"01686ed7-f889-4d7c-951a-6f6fd2babcc3","content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":true,"isPremium":false,"name":"Shenandoah University","type":"College","url":"shenandoah-university"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.8802},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":28310},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"880-1120"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Junior","body":"I have loved my time at Shenandoah!

We all come together for the homecoming football games in the fall, and the breathtaking conservatory performances all year round. My favorite time of the year on campus is just before Winter break when campus is all decorated with red and blue Christmas lights.

They help critique your resume for you and help you find internships during the summer. As for academic advising, they help you set up a 4-year plan of what classes you will be taking each semester and will adjust if you plan to study abroad. One thing I would like to see improvements on is racial diversity within the staff/faculty and nonfaculty members.

I like that Faulkner is a Christian based school because it gives me the freedom to express myself spiritually without any restraints. Faulkner has a great support team who is willing to help the students resolve issues that may occur during their studies while at Faulkner. I believe that Faulkner looks out for the best interest of its students, helping them to succeed and meet their potential goals in life. Faulkner keep their students informed on all activities that are happening on campus and want all students to be included becoming a well community, while studying at Faulkner. The one thing that I don’t like about Faulkner would be that my commute to campus is an hour and a half drive from where I live other than that I think Faulkner is a great place to study.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2018-02-28T19:44:47.774881Z","guid":"b23e6ad9-9055-4c78-b450-e619a3551260","rating":4},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":2}],"photos":{"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-86.21641,32.384181,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-86.21641,32.384181,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.7533333333333334,"count":300},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Montgomery, AL"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/faulkner-university/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"1f7c509c-df6f-44b1-98e7-f6eca4834b89","content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":true,"isPremium":false,"name":"Georgia Southwestern State University","type":"College","url":"georgia-southwestern-state-university"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.6818},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":12453},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"870-1060"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Freshman","body":"I have only been here a semester but everything is great.

Profs are great and super helpful. There are tons of resources on campus. It is a small school so you get all the attention you could ever need. We have access to a fabulous DO medical school if you are interested in research.  We just built a new business school and just got a beautiful donation for the education college. Marian is a great place. We are so close to Indy it is great but we are also close to speedway and other surrounding cities so it is easy to commute if you need.
