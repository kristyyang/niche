The MSC is a great student hub with a good food court, a restaurant, 4 floors of study or “chilling” areas, offices, event rooms, a theater, a ballroom, a pharmacy, a computer store and many more things. The library has resources from state of the art equipment, macs and PCs, digital media equipment with green screens, quiet study floors, a Starbucks, tutoring center, a writing center and so many more things. Central campus is very pretty and very green, with the MLK plaza in the middle and trees perfectly lined up. The athletics are great including the 3 gyms which include an indoor and an outdoor swimming pools, dance studio, wrestling room, cardio floor, weight floor, indoor track, volleyball, basketball and racquetball courts.

If tuition doesn't scare you, the housing costs will for sure. Also, sunburns from napping at the beach -because midterms kept you up all night are brutal.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2018-03-26T21:44:12.947746Z","guid":"a9529299-57a2-4154-8912-f019b756e7a9","rating":5},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":3.33}],"photos":{"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-157.816607,21.292648,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-157.816607,21.292648,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.415031115366204,"count":2089},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Honolulu, HI"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/university-of-hawaii-at-manoa/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"8d0039f7-2dd7-4510-9b5a-4f801b88a4e9","badge":{"display":"Best Colleges in America","ordinal":114,"total":1644,"vanityURL":"best-colleges"},"content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":true,"isPremium":false,"name":"Florida State University","type":"College","url":"florida-state-university"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.5801},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":16506},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"1110-1280"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Alum","body":"I received a high quality education at FSU.

Our theater department is nationally renowned, and our math department recently received a $1,000,000 gift from an alumnus to be used to hire new faculty. Speaking of faculty, they are great. Almost every professor I have worked with at Drew has taken my needs as a student into account and has gone out of their way to help me. On the other hand, the administration could be better. As well, the food is pretty awful and tuition is exorbitant, but that doesn't take away from the unique academic experience.

It is a large, beautiful campus, but the class sizes are relatively small. Even lecture halls have under 100 students. In my time at UNCW I grew close to many professors, and even was a TA. The only downfalls to this campus were parking and wifi. I had no other negative experiences. It is a fast growing school and I wish I didn't have to leave to go to grad school (they don't have physical therapy). In-state tuition is very reasonable, and I did not end up out of college drowning in debt. Overall, I would recommend uncw to anyone.

My course and professors all inspired me to find my passion. I changed my major after the first semester; which allowed me to explore the different career paths before I chose my current career goal. ASU truly opened my eyes to a lot of wonderful opportunities. I am taking my experiences working alongside my peers in the school newspaper \"State Press\" and student outreach \"Programming and Activities Board\" to learn valuable work ethics for future career skills. As a medical studies major, I still find it important to surround myself with other activities and involvements that are not related to my major. Therefore, the school paper gives me sense of the journalism world and the PAB allows me to explore skills in marketing and event planning.

Overall, the University provides an ideal situation for those who are not aiming for a large campus or large school. Buildings are no more than 10 minutes away from one another and the chances of bumping into someone you know is very high.

They encourage unity while allowing you to be yourself.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2018-05-26T20:33:57.309784Z","guid":"563d23ba-25b7-4d19-a82f-35c9a2e8d4b2","rating":5},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":4}],"photos":{"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-75.7536,39.679791,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-75.7536,39.679791,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.597298166613059,"count":3109},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Newark, DE"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/university-of-delaware/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"d3866e88-49fd-47ad-a8bc-6b74f86b9c33","badge":{"display":"Best Colleges in America","ordinal":172,"total":1644,"vanityURL":"best-colleges"},"content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":true,"isPremium":false,"name":"Saint Louis University","type":"College","url":"saint-louis-university"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.6474},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":33222},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"1110-1330"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Sophomore","body":"As a current sophomore at Saint Louis University, I want to preface by saying that I could not see myself at any other university. SLU is an extremely open college where you will meet people from diverse backgrounds who have different experiences. Of course, people will always complain and say that the \"rich white people\" surround SLU. However, if you actually try and engage in the SLU community you will find more than just that. SLU has given me life long friends and an education that I am proud of. So far my classes have gone well and are usually well taught. If there are any complaints, there are always surveys at the end of the semester that go straight to the department heads for review. Finding the right college for you is difficult. I was lucky enough to fall in love with SLU as soon as I visited. I definitely suggest visiting and doing an overnight to see if SLU is right for you.

The professors are very knowledgeable and hold a sincere passion for their fields. I enjoy the fact that students and professors are able to connect personally, so you can really get to know each other. This makes getting references much easier! The opportunities are an additional reason why I enjoy attending WOU. As a psychology major, I have an opportunity to be a research assistant, a teacher's assistant, or both! This provides an opportunity to experience those positions, and determine if they are areas that I want to pursue. WOU also has many activities and clubs, this is great because you can get to meet so many new people. One complaint I have is the advising available at WOU. I would enjoy more being able to sit with my advisor and create an academic plan instead of using an online system that tracks courses and credits.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2017-02-24T21:48:30.011242Z","guid":"ad59a95b-dfc8-4494-a2f2-4e26154f50c0","rating":5},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":2.66}],"photos":{"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-123.238785,44.851866,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-123.238785,44.851866,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.533333333333333,"count":975},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Monmouth, OR"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/western-oregon-university/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"4419c2e8-24f5-43f2-aff5-fa70b1063be4","badge":{"display":"Best Colleges in America","ordinal":272,"total":1644,"vanityURL":"best-colleges"},"content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"Saint Mary's College - Indiana","type":"College","url":"saint-marys-college---indiana"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.8165},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":25991},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"980-1160"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Sophomore","body":"I recently just transferred here, and so far its been great!

I will be an incoming freshman this fall and while I was at orientation I noticed a lot of awesome things. First off, the professors and faculty members at Hofstra are there to make sure you're at your best 24/7. There's so many places to go to receive help, it's very reassuring especially when you're having a bad day. Next, the campus and the dorms are nice. The campus is very large which means a lot of walking, but it's not that bad because there's such beautiful architecture and landscaping to look at. The dorms are small and neat, but there's air conditioning which is a major plus. I got to sit through a real college class, which at Hofstra are relatively small. The food at Hofstra has a pretty good selection, but nothing crazy. There are Starbucks, Dunkin Donuts, Subways, Sbarros, and many other places to grab a bite to eat. Overall, Hofstra has a lot to offer and I couldn't be more excited to start my 4-year journey there!","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2017-08-17T13:19:43.218362Z","guid":"0f59bdeb-af97-4200-988e-1f0722fbf2d9","rating":4},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":3.33}],"photos":{"default":{"crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/2fb77d3e7ebcda2dfc09ad08572622874a2ade97.jpg","MobileHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/667677aae7cb8cd43b8b8fa8cb1993cc9e04e87a.jpg"},"licenseName":"UNLICENSED"},"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-73.60078,40.715959,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-73.60078,40.715959,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.483424047501237,"count":2021},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Hempstead, NY"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/hofstra-university/#scatterplot"}}]}
