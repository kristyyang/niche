It's no wonder that they have been nationally recognized as one of the nation's most prestigious liberal arts and business colleges for centuries since the college's establishment in 1903! But, they don't offer degrees in just business and the liberal arts! You can take a whole variety of courses and end up with marketable jobs at the same time! The staff at Fisher College will go above and beyond to help you find your ideal job with the best pay. That's why, in my point of view, Fisher College works!

The professors care a lot about their students and how well they do. It is a liberal arts college meaning that they focus on teaching the students the importance of learning multiple subjects rather than having expertise in only one area. The school has the Integrated Studies course that everyone is required to take. Freshmen take \"Introduction to Liberal Arts,\" sophomores take \"Global Perspectives,\" juniors take \"Reflections,\" and seniors take a course on \"Citizenship.\" These courses help the students become aware of their communities and get them involved in helping to make the world a more welcoming and overall a better place. Because the school is in a very small town, it is not as diverse as other schools closer to the cities and big towns. However, everyone is welcoming and very helpful. They emphasize the importance of helping one another and the professors are excellent in helping their students achieve and reach their highest potential.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2018-01-20T05:12:47.114922Z","guid":"0cd35397-14df-4fdf-ac0f-35ddc8617049","rating":4},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":3}],"photos":{"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-90.637909,40.91459,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-90.637909,40.91459,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.4891944990176817,"count":509},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Monmouth, IL"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/monmouth-college/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"7d70626b-c30c-427f-949a-df29d53f4791","content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"William Penn University","type":"College","url":"william-penn-university"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.5867},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":20897},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"720-890"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Senior","body":"William Penn supports students through out their academic time at Penn.

Glenville has plenty of opportunities to participate in extracurricular activities as well. Tuition at Glenville is comparably cheaper than most accredited colleges and universities.

The professors are willing to work one-on-one and help you succeed. There is many resources available such as tutors, and the academic support center which helps students prioritize, schedule classes, and learn how to effectively study. The academics are optimal and require professionalism and the programs expect high quality, to their best effort out of the students. The community is very open and willing to help anybody. Lyndon gives the opportunity for students to be an athlete while having their main focus on school then sports after. There is many activities to do on campus from student life scheduling opportunities. Activities off campus also includes skiing, hiking, etc. Lyndon provides the optimal opportunity for school and fun, all while receivin the college experience.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2017-12-27T17:32:30.395408Z","guid":"05283d51-b253-4fbb-87ce-3c7896280321","rating":4},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":2.33}],"photos":{"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-72.024563,44.53433,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-72.024563,44.53433,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.34,"count":250},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Lyndonville, VT"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/lyndon-state-college/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"871038fd-adfe-462a-9873-d9533e8c290b","content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"Bacone College","type":"College","url":"bacone-college"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.5047},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":25029},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"740-920"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Freshman","body":"It’s a small college that’s growing steadily with an extremely athletic atmosphere!

Now that it is no longer a Girls Only School, my dream has come true!","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2017-08-19T07:32:01.380983Z","guid":"b7469134-c992-435f-b344-7f56678d6c0f","rating":5},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":2.33}],"photos":{"default":{"crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/3c9c0ecf5eca9aa351fd50d971390577b87c16b8.jpg","MobileHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/2426933832ee3d9d53bc26e017732247da1c22ce.jpg"},"licenseName":"UNLICENSED"},"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-79.068325,38.154799,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-79.068325,38.154799,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.3397312859884836,"count":521},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Staunton, VA"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/mary-baldwin-university/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"43e479bb-ad14-4ae9-96c5-ae4eaf01ced3","content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"Lourdes University","type":"College","url":"lourdes-university"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.8934},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":19635},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"860-1100"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Niche User","body":"If i have ever loved a school so much! To be such a new and advancing University, the housing is literally an apartment complex. Also, there are so many options for people to do. There are so many opportunities for working, volunteering, traveling, and simply being involved. The LEAP crew hosts free programs like going to Lions games or Cedar Point. Also stuff like glow parties. I still have my TShirt from my freshman year of 2012. The RAs are very attentive. Jets has the greatest enployees and they help the students. There is always something going on in the Den. There is also an open door policy. If there is a door open, walk into it and say Hello!. I also love the FYE course. It encourages freshmen students to get involved with the school and to attened different events. They even take you camping for orientation which was 4 days of awesome. I Love Lourdes University...HOME OF THE GREY WOLVES.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2017-04-26T22:36:18.850894Z","guid":"481c3798-b891-43ab-9222-73a90b918f27","rating":5},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":2.33}],"photos":{"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-83.706649,41.708694,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-83.706649,41.708694,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.7494505494505495,"count":455},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Sylvania, OH"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/lourdes-university/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"259ee2da-8aa1-4557-9b92-7611b7d71e5a","content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"Warner University","type":"College","url":"warner-university"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.4359},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":17309},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"802-970"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Senior","body":"My experience at Warner University has been very  positive because of my classmates and professors.

Everything from the type of education, professors and peers, to the environment, and the atmosphere... It's all incredible and incredibly exciting and loving.

The people are so friendly and inviting! The professors truly care about their students and want them to get the most out of their teaching; they really want them to learn.
