There is a clear \"Work Hard, Play Hard\" mentality among the students here. Professors take personal interests in their students, and the rigorous course loads pay off in spades. Hendrix College can be way too stressful at times, but at the end of the day, there are plenty of resources to help those in need of stress relief. The student housing for underclassmen, however, is abysmal. The dorms are not in the best shape, but there are plans to renovate in the next 5 years. The student Quad is better, yet the walls are so thin you can hear the student above you sneezing. The apartments are better, but they are sometimes a crap-shoot. Overal, the summer opportunities, Odyssey Program, academics, decent level of financial help, and extremely liberal atmosphere makes the high price tag worth it.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2018-01-19T17:48:02.861022Z","guid":"701064ed-b355-4b85-9988-1f95d0aacfcf","rating":4},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":3.33}],"photos":{"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-92.442021,35.09972,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-92.442021,35.09972,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.6958424507658645,"count":457},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Conway, AR"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/hendrix-college/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"62662d31-badd-4e5a-aeca-7326a8a4bfeb","content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"Muskingum University","type":"College","url":"muskingum-university"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.7741},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":18973},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"880-1120"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Sophomore","body":"I absolutely LOVE Muskingum University.

Almost all of my professors (30 out of 33) were people I could ask to be a mentor about deep issues I was dealing with.  great networking that helps to find jobs after school! Already working full-time the summer after graduation thanks to Asbury networking. I can't say enough about how great Asbury is.

Not to mention the programs are extremely intellectual and better prepare students to be future doctors, educators, engineers, entrepreneurs and more. If I could change anything about Elizabeth City State University, it would have to be the classrooms.  I personally taught the classes were over capacity and students were able to move around where they were more comfortable and engage efficiently.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2017-08-23T01:44:14.266812Z","guid":"d832d4ad-73e9-4af1-972e-049fb7c2e1b3","rating":4},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":2.33}],"photos":{"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-76.210063,36.273539,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-76.210063,36.273539,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.155902004454343,"count":449},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Elizabeth City, NC"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/elizabeth-city-state-university/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"0595d155-48bf-4c29-99d2-edad9f1b0ffa","content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"Graceland University","type":"College","url":"graceland-university"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.484},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":16547},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"810-1020"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Sophomore","body":"When it comes to Graceland University there is a lot of things that I personally would like to see be changed.

Even with the party crackdown, campus security still lacks cameras over most of campus and things regularly get stolen.
