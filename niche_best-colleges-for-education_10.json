Your professors strongly encourage you to better yourself in all aspects of your life: mentally, physically, and spiritually. You’re cared for and supported by everyone which allows you to take risks and grow. That’s part of the Jamestown and Midwest culture which I absolutely love and miss. Luckily, I was adopted by 3 families because I couldn’t go home for the holidays. They took me in whenever I needed a home. UJ will forever hold a special place in my heart!

It was founded in 1888 by William O'Hara, the first Bishop of Scranton, as St. Thomas College.[2] In 1938, the College was elevated to university status and took the name The University of Scranton.[3] The institution was operated by the Diocese of Scranton from its founding until 1897. While the Diocese of Scranton retained ownership of the University, it was administered by the Lasallian Christian Brothers from 1888 to 1942.[4] In 1942, the Society of Jesus took ownership and control of the University.[5] During the 1960s, the University became an independent institution under a lay Board of Trustees. The University of Scranton is one of 28 member institutions of the Association of Jesuit Colleges and Universities and is served by the Scranton Jesuit Community.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2018-05-30T14:39:25.448236Z","guid":"4c470faf-319f-45ef-827a-dd7c99a08494","rating":5},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":3.66}],"photos":{"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-75.658031,41.40715,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-75.658031,41.40715,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.614991482112436,"count":587},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Scranton, PA"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/university-of-scranton/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"1b997bd9-8451-44fa-bf60-1b5d24cde35e","badge":{"display":"Best Colleges for Education in America","ordinal":241,"total":756,"vanityURL":"best-colleges-for-education"},"content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":true,"isPremium":true,"name":"Manhattan College","type":"College","url":"manhattan-college"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.7137},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":32576},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"1000-1210"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Junior","body":"I love Manhattan College!

The academic programs are cutting edge and highly regarded, like the computer science programs and the education programs. We are one of the few, if not the only, universities with a fully functioning laboratory school. This school is also very affordable for both in-state and out-of-state students, thanks to the Bearcat Advantage scholarship which covers the difference of in-state tuition for out-of-state students. Another great thing about this university is that laptops and textbooks are included in tuition. Aside from the academic and campus culture, the community culture is also amazing. This small town community provides you with warmth and comfort as everyone is treated like family. If you don't mind being in a relatively small and semi-rural town, I highly recommend Northwest because the environment is simply encouraging.

The people here made me feel so welcome, and I truly felt like part of a family during my 3 years as a student. Most of the professors are incredible people; I could tell they wanted to see me do well. Because of the small class sizes, it is really easy to build relationships with your professors and get to know other students. For me, this really helped to ensure my success in classes. In addition, there are lots of organizations and volunteer opportunities on campus to help students get involved in the community and feel at home. The campus is absolutely beautiful! However, housing isn't the greatest; some of the dorms are rather old. A few dorms are new or have been renovated recently, so those offer a better living situation. Also, there aren't many food options on campus, and I rarely visited some, as the food was inedible. The meal plans they offer are ridiculous and are not at all worth the money you are asked to spend.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2018-05-16T15:00:30.995265Z","guid":"d47ebb91-ecd3-4e3c-be64-d26c66817072","rating":4},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":3.66}],"photos":{"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-83.651042,32.829731,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-83.651042,32.829731,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.582269503546099,"count":1410},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Macon, GA"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/mercer-university/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"dc24c3d4-310d-475f-8637-b2a18f38af11","badge":{"display":"Best Colleges for Education in America","ordinal":249,"total":756,"vanityURL":"best-colleges-for-education"},"content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"Bellarmine University","type":"College","url":"bellarmine-university"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.8245},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":24742},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"980-1160"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Freshman","body":"Bellarmine University has a great reputation for the business school.

They care so deeply about their students, and desire to know them on a personal level, and that is such a wonderful thing. It helps you to feel at home at Oklahoma Christian.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2018-06-05T03:49:37.84172Z","guid":"4212d9a1-6cb3-449b-a1f4-1f0816b53d69","rating":5},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":3}],"photos":{"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-97.468312,35.609042,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-97.468312,35.609042,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.7734241908006814,"count":587},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Edmond, OK"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/oklahoma-christian-university/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"8dba5571-9c2b-4c81-9db6-14b9cbbdb67b","badge":{"display":"Best Colleges for Education in America","ordinal":262,"total":756,"vanityURL":"best-colleges-for-education"},"content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"SUNY Fredonia","type":"College","url":"suny-fredonia"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.6235},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":16622},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"900-1120"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Sophomore","body":"I like Fredonia for the most part, I live off-campus, and I think the student life seems rather dull, outside looking in. However, the academics are decent and it's a good school. I feel like some facilities could be improved, like Thompson Hall. I believe the latter houses the History, Psychology, and Teaching departments, but the building itself is rather dreary. They recently repainted the walls which is nice! The diversity is also very good, as an LGBT student, it's very accepting here and I appreciate it a lot. As for race and socioeconomic backgrounds, it's diverse in those aspects as well! I really like this school, but as a local, I can tell you that Fredonia itself is a pretty boring town, however I've noticed that many students from NYC appreciate that.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2018-01-20T08:04:05.042899Z","guid":"dd3407fb-96bb-4744-9704-16e57139c800","rating":4},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":3}],"photos":{"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-79.336109,42.450961,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-79.336109,42.450961,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.5501379944802207,"count":1087},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Fredonia, NY"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/suny-fredonia/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"96157503-b967-490a-ad5e-c0d0d18b2dc1","badge":{"display":"Best Colleges for Education in America","ordinal":263,"total":756,"vanityURL":"best-colleges-for-education"},"content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":true,"isPremium":false,"name":"University of Nebraska at Kearney","type":"College","url":"university-of-nebraska-at-kearney"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.8508},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":15520},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"830-1020"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Freshman","body":"My experience at the University of Nebraska at Kearney has been very good.

But our campus contains such diversity that you run into people different than you all the time. Campus activities promote integration of all students, from athletes to bookish types, from African American students to South Korean students.\nThe one thing that many people are weary about is the lifestyle statement, which prohibits many of the 'typical college' activities (smoking, drinking, sex on campus, etc). As an RA, my interactions with the lifestyle statement have given me a broad perspective of the pros and cons of having such an agreement. As a Christian community I think it is imperative that we hold our students to a wholesome standard. However, for those students who do not practice Christianity, I have seen isolation and exclusion on occasion.\nOverall, I love Greenville and am content with my choice for my educational advancement.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2018-02-28T01:52:25.072542Z","guid":"2485c9ef-88ae-471d-846d-63a7487891ef","rating":4},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":3}],"photos":{"default":{"crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/fdd4165fcee1e058a86cf3a51f22704d6bad62b1.jpg","MobileHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/8642a02b748cd3ca2b270e88dceaada520d88779.jpg"},"licenseName":"UNLICENSED"},"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-89.4089,38.8928,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-89.4089,38.8928,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.458974358974359,"count":390},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Greenville, IL"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/greenville-university/#scatterplot"}}]}
