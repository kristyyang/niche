I can tell that the professors are teaching what the student needs to learn, my classes so far are going very well. Also, I know where to go if I need anything fixed or check out, Rust College has a very Mass Communication program. But I really like the way Rust College students and professors get their business and class assignments done.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2017-09-28T21:37:02.494691Z","guid":"45ed8afc-ae97-4318-b646-7d82b216794e","rating":5},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":2}],"photos":{"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-89.446999,34.776862,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-89.446999,34.776862,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.110497237569061,"count":181},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Holly Springs, MS"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/rust-college/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"e2821977-d754-4dee-84fc-f8d6628c1c28","content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":true,"isPremium":false,"name":"Mary Baldwin University","type":"College","url":"mary-baldwin-university"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.9948},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":18543},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"860-1080"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Sophomore","body":"Mary Baldwin University, what could I say in order to give you a picture of campus life.

Let me be clear - if you want a huge state school where you can walk into the cafeteria and no one will recognize you, Averett is not for you. But if you want to speak to almost everyone you pass on your way to class, have professors who take time to get to know you and will ask if y'all can catch up after you graduate, have the opportunity to take on leadership roles in your extra curricular activities, and become a part of a FAMILY, Averett should be your number one choice.\n\nThe professors and advisors are phenomenal. If you're wondering just how close of a relationship you make with the staff at Averett - my advisor has a picture of us hanging in her office from my senior pinning, and when going through a hard time in a leadership role, the president wrote me an encouraging handwritten letter. The relationships you make with the staff are exceptional.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2018-02-24T06:03:41.889373Z","guid":"12269862-28ce-48f8-88ec-2ccbae4a7cd1","rating":5},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":2.33}],"photos":{"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-79.413214,36.577273,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-79.413214,36.577273,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.473015873015873,"count":315},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Danville, VA"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/averett-university/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"96b631bd-c67e-4c7a-81fe-1c5b14df55ca","badge":{"display":"Best Colleges in America","ordinal":415,"total":1644,"vanityURL":"best-colleges"},"content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":true,"isPremium":false,"name":"St. Thomas University - Florida","type":"College","url":"st-thomas-university---florida"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.5413},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":18778},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"840-1050"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Freshman","body":"The campus is a bit small, but its easier to get to classes.

Another thing I like about it is, they offer a bridge program with the University of Kansas so you can take classes there at a cheaper price than actually going to KU.

The classes are not very difficult. I also enjoy that classes are not to spread apart so you do not have to get a certain parking spot or try to fight for a parking spot because most classes are walking-distance. The professors always offer a one-on-one, and it is easy to get help. The only disadvantage is the price. It is pretty pricey, so that is why I am not in their meal-plan nor a resident.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2018-06-08T16:13:03.494108Z","guid":"bb69e618-fd32-4aa0-a088-8c2a00640ad6","rating":4},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":2}],"photos":{"default":{"crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/30faea2ad04b73f86a8ff432afec0d813a2e3be0.jpg","MobileHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/6a555ea4f7bc4fbadf165cda0d86e531f1bf3005.jpg"},"licenseName":"UNLICENSED"},"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-83.745972,34.594437,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-83.745972,34.594437,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":4,"count":146},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Cleveland, GA"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/truett-mcconnell-university/#scatterplot"}}]}
