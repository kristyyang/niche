Friendly students and caring staff.  With the smaller class sizes the Professors are able to focus on the students.  They all are open and welcome visits to their offices.  It is a pretty campus, up front.  One major drawback is NO football team.  The Basketball teams do VERY well.   The athletic players are well supported by staff and students, but NOT given easy grades.  The food could be better.  There is a nice movie theater for students.  Could use a little more stuff in the student center to keep students on campus and not off looking for inappropriate things to do.  This university is located in a small rural TN town with nothing to do off campus.  Luckily there is a nice size town about 30 mins away that has a lot of fun things to do.

Fort Lewis College also has programs like TRIO that help students improve academically and have resources for one-on-one tutoring. What I like about this college is that professors help students achieve in their academic skills by setting real-life examples in the classroom and in grading. What Fort Lewis can improve on would be having more financial advisors that can help students who have deeper problems within financial needs.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2018-02-18T03:01:56.625164Z","guid":"504cf946-b9df-4159-a8fc-87030fac6c4c","rating":4},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":2.66}],"photos":{"default":{"crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/971a1dff85c75e5d500e78e9e28f811dca3ffc09.jpg","MobileHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/3746340e765876783ed0fb3672fa5e7e23d4ad5c.jpg"},"licenseName":"UNLICENSED"},"mapbox_header":{"crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-107.867003,37.275428,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-107.867003,37.275428,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"UNLICENSED"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.656891495601173,"count":1023},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Durango, CO"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/fort-lewis-college/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"4f36b886-599a-46bb-9861-e309e3a699d5","content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"Eastern Kentucky University","type":"College","url":"eastern-kentucky-university"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.8633},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":12255},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"930-1140"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Freshman","body":"I have only been here one full semester, but I already love this college.

The professors are pretty cool. There are students, upperclassmen, that are definitely happy to help you understand. There are a lot of international students, so there's a lot of diversity on campus. The academic scene was good until the school needed to be upgraded, which means there won't be any Spanish or French majors. I'm kinda hoping they don't take music for my friend's sake. The area the college is in is a little sketchy, a bit of an understatement. There were at least 3 emails about guys running from police or something, but the Columbia College Police Department keeps us safe. As for the party scene, you're gonna have to go to University of South Carolina or Five Points. Bring a friend if you're going to Five Points, though. It's not notorious for danger; it's just safer that way, and it was recommended by the people who actually live here.

I find that CSULA is very safety-conscious, maintains an excellent campus environment and student life, and hires very impressive and motivated professors who instill knowledge and their own passions into the students they teach. However, if there are two aspects that I would like to see CSULA improve on, they would be the local area and campus food. I would appreciate it if there were interesting activities to participate in in the local area and if there was a much bigger variety of healthy food choices aside from the food trucks and the food court. However, I find Cal State LA to be an overall spectacular university to study at, and I would recommend it to any graduate or undergraduate!","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2018-03-30T06:59:49.188462Z","guid":"2121b6a9-68ec-470f-9ffa-8acb349a04f2","rating":5},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":2.66}],"photos":{"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-118.168965,34.066927,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-118.168965,34.066927,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.499433320740461,"count":2647},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Los Angeles, CA"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/california-state-university---los-angeles/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"f745290f-9ecf-471e-b569-36a45d6745e2","content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"Florida Atlantic University","type":"College","url":"florida-atlantic-university"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.5978},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":11303},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"950-1140"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Sophomore","body":"Florida Atlantic is a great school!

The campus is huge and it has an amazing scenery, the campus is fully equipped with hundreds of learning materials for different majors, qualified staff who are constantly willing to help you out with any difficulty, and free transportation services within and off-campus. \n   Admission is quite easy, and the school has an acceptance rate of 71% which is quite fair in my opinion.\nI have only been attending UMassD for a few months as a freshman, but I honestly feel like it is the right place for me and I would recommend this to anyone looking to attend college.\n   Also, UMassD provides sporting activities and entertainment on a regular basis, there is a whole section specifically designed for sports and athletics, and the campus holds concerts in the auditorium, and parties in the recreational centres for students to enjoy.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2018-02-06T01:08:26.677064Z","guid":"e5fdf1d9-92d4-47e8-8225-2def46658cc9","rating":4},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":2.66}],"photos":{"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-71.005528,41.628861,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-71.005528,41.628861,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.3816067653276956,"count":946},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"North Dartmouth, MA"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/university-of-massachusetts---dartmouth/#scatterplot"}}]}
