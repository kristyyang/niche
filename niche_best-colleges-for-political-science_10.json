But on the real— campus is absolutely beautiful, especially to a girl from flat Texas like me! Fayetteville is utterly charming, and has something for everyone. With thousands of international students and its central location, the diversity is special and so treasured on this campus. I am never worried about making friends of different backgrounds, or finding my niche with those who share my cultural background because it happens so naturally. There are also plenty of religious groups to get plugged into on and around campus. My only complaint is the Hill, but it is worth it to live in Pomfret Hall with bigger bathrooms, a nice common area, and the dining hall which comes in handy on days of inclement weather. I truly love being a Razorback, and am so grateful to call Northwest Arkansas my second home.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2017-12-31T08:20:55.505021Z","guid":"743e04d5-da12-4e79-b8a9-e1fbbec69371","rating":5},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":4}],"photos":{"default":{"author":"mtnorton","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/5469a0f272cd5651b2fcfac357f368e9aedfee1b.jpg","MobileHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/c40b369d23ffb3ef5ca2388827b771cfcb22ef59.jpg","Thumbnail":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/a2ba338f9c416b38ba6a2ee45506047d4f0176e7"},"licenseName":"CC BY ","licenseUrl":"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/2.0/","sourceUrl":"https://www.flickr.com/photos/mtnorton/7212584262/"},"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-94.178214,36.06153,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-94.178214,36.06153,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.787639710716634,"count":3042},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Fayetteville, AR"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/university-of-arkansas/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"d5a8a9d2-33cc-48bb-9c90-4647317d5075","badge":{"display":"Best Colleges for Political Science in America","ordinal":234,"total":520,"vanityURL":"best-colleges-for-political-science"},"content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":true,"isPremium":true,"name":"Colorado State University","type":"College","url":"colorado-state-university"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.7796},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":16232},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"1020-1250"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Alum","body":"Colorado State University met all my expectations for the college I had always imagined going to for my bachelors degree. Unfortunately for me, at the time I had no clue what I wanted out of life and very little passion for the degree I had chosen to study there which was Journalism. I had no direction, no motivation, and no confidence which quickly led to my demise. Finally, over three years later, I now have realized my path and it has absolutely nothing to do with CSU or politics. I am sure it's a great school with tons to offer if you apply yourself, but to be honest I got very little out of my education there and feel like I may have waisted a lot of time and money during my 7 year stint at Colorado State University.

Central campus is very pretty and very green, with the MLK plaza in the middle and trees perfectly lined up.

There is truly no greater resource to college students than having professors who care about your academic career and success. There have been countless occasions where the help or advice of a professor has totally altered my performance in a class for the better. The students are all very respectful and hard-working.

Overall, California Lutheran University is a place for people who want to feel at home and  feel like they can make an impact on their school.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2018-02-13T23:19:31.980109Z","guid":"a81a25d7-b162-466f-9a18-89cd2bf61f20","rating":4},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":3.33}],"photos":{"default":{"crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/74d57321f1feca534f97f72dbdf266c17c96fde7.jpg","MobileHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/ca4c9ccadcdbd968312904929f193a47e920d5cb.jpg"},"licenseName":"UNLICENSED"},"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-118.879467,34.225551,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-118.879467,34.225551,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.7558365758754864,"count":1028},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Thousand Oaks, CA"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/california-lutheran-university/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"3bd96e46-a63c-4585-ba02-796f127f4cef","content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"University of California - Riverside","type":"College","url":"university-of-california---riverside"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.6634},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":12841},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"940-1190"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Freshman","body":"If coming from the Bay Area, you'll be disappointed about the diversity of cuisine in the surrounding area of the campus. The residential hall food is alright and are always buffet style so there can always be something for you to eat. But once in awhile you'll get tired of it, but do not fret! There are dining dollars that you can use for on campus dining that is not in the dining halls. I have been told that the quality of food here has been better so if you are thinking about attending this school, do not expect much but do expect a growth in quality while you're here. If you do not wish to dine on campus, there is a university village that is a 15-20 minute walk away with more restaurants for you to experience. You will be given discounts at the theater there and coupons for being a student at UCR.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2017-12-09T18:55:37.124305Z","guid":"1f33e0c3-c954-4939-881e-1a61b963d1d0","rating":4},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":3.66}],"photos":{"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-117.331098,33.97588,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-117.331098,33.97588,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.499163599866176,"count":2989},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Riverside, CA"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/university-of-california---riverside/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"e08e643d-b10a-4d71-9ec6-666077482edb","content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":true,"isPremium":true,"name":"Ohio Wesleyan University","type":"College","url":"ohio-wesleyan-university"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.7155},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":27967},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"990-1250"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Freshman","body":"Small town atmosphere, safe, plenty to do, liberal arts, fun fun fun!

It's challenging (especially if you do the Honors College), but worth your while. THe study abroad programs are EXCELLENT. I did 2 of them myself, and definitely recommend it-- they find a way to finance whatever study abroad you want to do, through their scholarship office. \nI only take 1 star away because I was a commuter and did not enjoy VCU as much as the residential students.

Clubs and activities offered by UNCA were very helpful in the transfer transition to university.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2018-01-03T05:29:28.327373Z","guid":"b56352a5-b9a9-4eda-87bc-ea524ce68526","rating":5},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":3.33}],"photos":{"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-82.565259,35.616618,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-82.565259,35.616618,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.7746967071057194,"count":577},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Asheville, NC"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/university-of-north-carolina-at-asheville/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"64d8b1e0-b8cb-4358-8880-643050a09d66","content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"Western Washington University","type":"College","url":"western-washington-university"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.8312},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":16245},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"990-1220"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Freshman","body":"Western Washington University has a great community established in the university as well as surrounding the university.
