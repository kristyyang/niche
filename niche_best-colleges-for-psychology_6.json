As a psychology major it is hard to get into classes you need as they close out, even if you came in with a ton of AP credits. Also, so many classes are big so its harder to focus and do well in them. The campus is hilly. Academics are great, i’ve only had one bad teacher. Advising sucks I had to figure everything out on my own. Mountainview dorms were awfull, invisible RA, no community events, unfriendly people etc. Now I live in Newing and I love it and it’s so much better! Many Long Island students, intentational students (mostly from Asia) and Jewish students. You have to find your people at this school but once you do your experience can be great. Also, we don’t have certain majors like education (also communications, and others people complain about) which really sucks but they try to sell you on their grad program. The food is hit or miss, definitely go to the Kosher station since they have the best food.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2018-05-23T01:30:53.174035Z","guid":"98f168b2-72e9-48d0-bb5e-1cc0fdef30f8","rating":4},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":3.66}],"photos":{"default":{"crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/843cc93be5f59a4bf97adb882d92fccaf932660b.jpg","MobileHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/e1bba7684cb59ca91b80ae5381f80c29566dec0c.jpg"},"licenseName":"UNLICENSED"},"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-75.971143,42.088049,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-75.971143,42.088049,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.5464154411764706,"count":2176},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Vestal, NY"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/binghamton-university-suny/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"1976253d-1468-4520-965e-357aa7797732","badge":{"display":"Best Colleges for Psychology in America","ordinal":127,"total":993,"vanityURL":"best-colleges-for-psychology"},"content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"Augustana University","type":"College","url":"augustana-university"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.6913},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":19974},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"930-1230"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Sophomore","body":"My experience at Augustana University has been everything I imagined and more. From the beginning of my relationship with AU, I have felt special and valued. The Admissions Department is superb - campus visits run smoothly, student ambassadors are friendly and helpful, Admissions Counselors are great and ready to answer any and every question. Campus life is great - first year residences are not too different from any other university BUT the free laundry is a major bonus! Also, free mini fridge/microwave units are available in every room. Printing services are more than adequate - 500 free pages per year (I only used about 200 this year!). Dining services are adequate and they're always looking to improve. Professors are superb - open door policy makes visiting offices much more inviting and professors are so accessible. Classes are informative, relevant, and challenging.

All around, it's my dream University.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2018-03-28T19:01:53.950799Z","guid":"053f6b46-001a-463c-918a-bb2b3715a877","rating":5},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":3.66}],"photos":{"default":{"author":"30791749@N07","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/fb90d2b3ad935c89ade7379fbae247b55fda1dd6.jpg","MobileHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/bcfdc0f48a7c27526977a21dfa677e69b4844f1c.jpg","Thumbnail":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/68d3568efbd5aaba40447846736fa48571b1d802"},"licenseName":"CC BY ","licenseUrl":"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/2.0/","sourceUrl":"https://www.flickr.com/photos/30791749@N07/11540284636/"},"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-97.361537,32.709568,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-97.361537,32.709568,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.85,"count":1460},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Fort Worth, TX"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/texas-christian-university/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"a08a99fb-b3a5-4b4a-86f3-167d77a9b2ac","badge":{"display":"Best Colleges for Psychology in America","ordinal":133,"total":993,"vanityURL":"best-colleges-for-psychology"},"content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":true,"isPremium":false,"name":"Chapman University","type":"College","url":"chapman-university"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.5403},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":40709},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"1110-1300"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Junior","body":"I love Chapman!

There's something for everyone if you seek it out. Additionally, I have been blessed with fantastic work and internship opportunities from this school, which are extremely valuable. However, athletics are not a huge priority for the school, which is slightly a bummer. I am an athlete at Chapman and I would definitely love to see more student support of athletics. What's great is that the student athletes and athletic directors have been very proactive about this. They are working hard to draw more support for all teams and make athletics more inclusive.

Hendrix College can be way too stressful at times, but at the end of the day, there are plenty of resources to help those in need of stress relief. The student housing for underclassmen, however, is abysmal. The dorms are not in the best shape, but there are plans to renovate in the next 5 years. The student Quad is better, yet the walls are so thin you can hear the student above you sneezing. The apartments are better, but they are sometimes a crap-shoot.

The professors are knowledgable and with a smaller campus and small class sizes, you can really get the attention and help you need from your professors. However, Cal Poly struggles with diversity. There are some programs directed to making prospective students of color feel more welcome (such as Poly Cultural Weekend) but overall, people of color make up less than half of the student body. There is even less people of color apart of Cal Poly's faculty. The lack of diversity is also apparent in the town, not just on campus.  If you are coming from a big city to San Luis Obispo, Cal Poly will be a big change. Since it is such a smaller, quieter area, there is not much to do here, especially if you're under 21. That being said, there are a lot of places to hike and hammock if you're a nature lover! The Farmers Market on Thursdays are a popular spot and attract many residents.

SLU has given me life long friends and an education that I am proud of. So far my classes have gone well and are usually well taught. If there are any complaints, there are always surveys at the end of the semester that go straight to the department heads for review. Finding the right college for you is difficult.

Unlike at most schools, greek life is a positive addition to the campus, and offers various leadership and philanthropic opportunities for those involved. Additionally, the coursework is manageable, yet still vigorous. Faculty are easily accessible, and class sized are small enough for professors to notice absences.

In the beginning I was uncomfortable with my transition and unable to feel at home. Through clubs and sports teams I was able to develop new friendships and life skills that made me feel more at home. There are so many opportunities presented to students at USC that all should take advantage of. One of the most important things that is clearly valued here, is academics. My professors so far have been some of the most passionate people I have met. A favorite course I have taken here has been environmental ethics. I took this course as a philosophy requirement and it inspired me to change my major to environmental studies.

Its a close knit school and very friendly csmpus. Academics are very good with small class sizes.  My daughter, who is African American, has made friends of all sorts and is involved in a lot. Sure, it does not have the big school sports scene but the college was top ranked in division two in severals sports. Security seems tight so far and there's a real emphasis on community service. If you want a school where the student will not get lost in a crowd and will get a very good foundation, Rockhurst is an under the radar gem with well respected academics as with most Jesuit colleges. Its not a commuter school even though its in an urban area.

Whether it's research or internships or pursuits fo further education, proactive St. Olaf students have many resources they can take advantage of. The curriculum is tough no matter what department you take courses in. Professors have extremely high expectations for their students, however they do everything in their power to build your way to those high expectations. It can be difficult to find a study/social life balance. If you cannot develop strong study habits, classes will be a struggle. There are a ton of resources available to students who haven't established study habits and professors are happy to work with students. The open-door policy is an awesome thing to take advantage of. There can be a sense of a competitive atmosphere, but usually there is a stronger sense of community and camaraderie between students because everyone is facing many of the same challenges in an academic sense.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2017-12-29T06:15:09.010955Z","guid":"0327f163-663c-474f-aa4e-9a560bc27a1d","rating":4},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":4}],"photos":{"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-93.183633,44.462884,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-93.183633,44.462884,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.617862371888726,"count":683},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Northfield, MN"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/st-olaf-college/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"cb3dfa63-2ab6-4f7a-a218-4919f8d8b694","badge":{"display":"Best Colleges for Psychology in America","ordinal":143,"total":993,"vanityURL":"best-colleges-for-psychology"},"content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"University of Dayton","type":"College","url":"university-of-dayton"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.6035},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":34019},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"1020-1240"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Freshman","body":"Overall it's a great campus, with a really good vibe.

While it has a very rigorous academic program, the school also provides a range of resource to choose from if a student is ever in need of help, both academically and otherwise. Despite being an open campus, as a cis-female individual I still feel reasonably safe. The campus is small and beautiful, with the state capital building just across the street. The student body shares a close-knit bond that is perhaps even more so than larger schools, due to the smaller undergrad population. Professors and staff are generally very open, accepting, and easy to approach without fear of judgement. It is a very expensive education, but the majority of students receive some sort of financial aid or scholarship. I'm so glad to be fortunate enough to be able to attend this school.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2018-05-18T20:39:06.20624Z","guid":"0f4d17a5-cf3c-4882-af66-e03a836d4ad0","rating":4},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":3.66}],"photos":{"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-123.030727,44.935743,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-123.030727,44.935743,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.601108033240997,"count":722},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Salem, OR"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/willamette-university/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"d4afc202-a90c-4cb9-9c9f-f7d0e9db2743","badge":{"display":"Best Colleges for Psychology in America","ordinal":149,"total":993,"vanityURL":"best-colleges-for-psychology"},"content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"Auburn University","type":"College","url":"auburn-university"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.8054},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":21698},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"1060-1260"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Junior","body":"I adore the sense of family here!
