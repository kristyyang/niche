AUM provide many opportunities to get involved on campus so that your voice can be heard. One of my favorite features that AUM is the learning resources.  They have many useful resources that can be used to get help outside of classes. If I had to change anything about Auburn University at Montgomery, I would change the food options and tuition fees. The food here is good, but also could be better.  As far as tuition, I think they should provide more scholarships for students who pay out of pocket. When choosing a college,   it is important to feel like you have made the best decision. At AUM, my decision, I believe hascollegbeen fulfilled. Overall, my experience at AUM has been non-complaint and decent. I am very excited to see where AUM take me in the near future!","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2018-04-30T21:05:39.579125Z","guid":"13b75947-7d59-4d3a-ae27-bd5fc0ee8ba5","rating":5},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":2.66}],"photos":{"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-86.177351,32.369939,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-86.177351,32.369939,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.567140600315956,"count":633},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Montgomery, AL"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/auburn-university---montgomery/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"2a97f7fd-da39-476f-8a72-3ebeb519914d","content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"Stevenson University","type":"College","url":"stevenson-university"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.6076},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":27686},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"910-1130"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Junior","body":"I love the small classroom sizes, I feel my professors really get to know me.
