Friendly students and caring staff.  With the smaller class sizes the Professors are able to focus on the students.  They all are open and welcome visits to their offices.  It is a pretty campus, up front.  One major drawback is NO football team.  The Basketball teams do VERY well.   The athletic players are well supported by staff and students, but NOT given easy grades.  The food could be better.  There is a nice movie theater for students.  Could use a little more stuff in the student center to keep students on campus and not off looking for inappropriate things to do.  This university is located in a small rural TN town with nothing to do off campus.  Luckily there is a nice size town about 30 mins away that has a lot of fun things to do.   Many alumni stay in the area. Great place to go!","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2018-02-16T23:06:07.411236Z","guid":"e282e943-19f1-4b04-a890-f7afbe8e6b06","rating":4},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":2.66}],"photos":{"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-88.639418,35.440073,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-88.639418,35.440073,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.6876513317191284,"count":413},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Henderson, TN"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/freed-hardeman-university/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"b1f5f75f-7ba8-4834-a366-7a6083c21995","content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"Vanguard University of Southern California","type":"College","url":"vanguard-university-of-southern-california"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.7024},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":21827},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"830-1030"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Freshman","body":"Vanguard University is quite the experience. It is a campus that is filled with lost spirits with the desire of hope. What I mean by this is, many come to Vanguard with broken pieces or just completely unsure of who they are but after being on campus they quickly realize that God has strategically placed them right where they are. Vanguard is filled with bright life's willing to take on the world with the sole flame of Jesus with-in them. If there was anything that should be changed with-in Vanguard it is definitely towards the food being provided. It is not that the food is bad, it just could be better. If all a campus needs to improve is foodservice, they must be doing something right. Vanguard is a home to many people who have discovered who they are. It is a school that not only excels with excellent professors and campus life, but a school that takes your purpose and morphs it into a future.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2018-02-22T20:37:12.806526Z","guid":"a6824192-ced9-4bce-b046-6315a01728c5","rating":5},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":3.33}],"photos":{"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-117.900911,33.662686,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-117.900911,33.662686,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.759305210918114,"count":806},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Costa Mesa, CA"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/vanguard-university-of-southern-california/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"3419cf36-507d-4841-8438-f52ac6f45c15","content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"Salisbury University","type":"College","url":"salisbury-university"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.6593},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":17678},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"1080-1230"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Freshman","body":"So far, I have had a relatively good experience at Salisbury University.

Classes are small and  only taught by professors with PHDs who are entirely invested in their students and will  know you by name within a few weeks. The curriculum is in depth and aimed at preparing you for real world employment, or to continue your education.  WNEU is well managed, with many opportunities to grow through clubs, activities, community involvement, and options to study abroad.    The campus is a must see, offering state of the art facilities and technology with impeccably manicured grounds and an amazingly clean campus.   The college offers many scholarships  to students who excel academically.  As a second year Junior, I am having a tremendous college experience and highly recommend you put WNEU high on your list, and please come and take a tour, as I cannot possibly tell you all this University has to offer.

I have not visited many other colleges before so I am not going to say that this is the best one, however I am going to say that it is a great school. The atmosphere is nice, the campus is beautiful, and there are many things to do on campus. The facilities are all very nice, modern, and clean, and there is almost always something to do on campus. I was actually faced with the opportunity to transfer to another school that would be closer to home, but I just couldn't bring myself to doing it because this school did not compare to Andrews. \nAnother thing about Andrews is that it is very diverse--that is one of the major things that I enjoy the most.

There's quite a lot to do in OKC. Ones first impression may say that the city is small and scattered, but if you look hard enough there is great things there. Same with SWCU. The opportunities that SWCU off are just about limitless. The relationship one might build with fellow students, could be some of the most important ones in life.

We have access to a fabulous DO medical school if you are interested in research.  We just built a new business school and just got a beautiful donation for the education college. Marian is a great place. We are so close to Indy it is great but we are also close to speedway and other surrounding cities so it is easy to commute if you need. Marian is just a great place.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2018-01-24T21:27:21.131699Z","guid":"d5e13c90-bb6f-499b-861d-9df674962413","rating":5},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":3.33}],"photos":{"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-86.204599,39.81534,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-86.204599,39.81534,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.53,"count":400},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Indianapolis, IN"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/marian-university---indiana/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"1368f5bc-1447-469d-b06c-5c69a8b37a6a","content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"University of Hawaii at Manoa","type":"College","url":"university-of-hawaii-at-manoa"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.8498},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":13520},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"970-1190"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Senior","body":"The Good: Excellent distance learning for students who live off island!

Also, the beaches can eat up your entire day so maybe study first. \nThe Ugly: Tuition is insane. Highly recommend finding places to donate plasma/blood/etc or do some busking to help with tuition.

There are ways to socialize and meet new people almost every night but if you don't go you'll never make friends. Many of the professors are amazing and care not only about your academics but your whole life. Everyone here is apart of a massive family and it's amazing.

Overall, I found this school to be a great value and would encourage prospective students to get as involved as possible to really see how much there is to offer.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2018-03-30T19:11:31.412394Z","guid":"a38cf4c6-c731-4099-993a-770bf43f20c5","rating":5},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":3.33}],"photos":{"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-86.172217,39.772948,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-86.172217,39.772948,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.573560131304088,"count":3351},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Indianapolis, IN"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/indiana-university-purdue-university---indianapolis-iupui/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"dedaee55-c30e-4ad8-9db7-9f868e5e4813","content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"Carroll College","type":"College","url":"carroll-college"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.7148},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":25449},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"990-1220"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Freshman","body":"I am currently a freshman at Carroll College in Helena, MT. I'm so glad I chose to come to Carroll. It's small, family friendly, and feels like its own little community. I was choosing between another school and this one, and I couldn't be happier for deciding on Carroll! My intended major is Nursing with the intentions of going into Pediatrics/Neonatal and working at St. Jude one day. This school is well-known for its success in the medical programs that it offers. Once again, I couldn't be happier with my decision to attend Carroll and hope others think the same.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2018-01-02T23:50:02.791122Z","guid":"a39817da-a21c-457d-837a-b712f1bec711","rating":5},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":3.33}],"photos":{"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-112.04053,46.602202,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-112.04053,46.602202,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.5735930735930737,"count":462},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Helena, MT"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/carroll-college/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"5740f47d-9104-43ce-9ab2-bf59beb6084a","content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":true,"isPremium":false,"name":"Penn State Beaver","type":"College","url":"penn-state-beaver"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.8589},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":16799},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"880-1170"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Senior","body":"Penn State Beaver is a great campus to attend, especially if you are interested in Information Technology.
