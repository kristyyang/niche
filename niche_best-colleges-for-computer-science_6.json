Even more so, I love the city in which it resides. Rhodes does a great job of encouraging its students to go beyond campus and experience what Memphis has to offer those who live there. Further, the school is very service oriented, and generally does a great job with connecting students to service opportunities. Unlike at most schools, greek life is a positive addition to the campus, and offers various leadership and philanthropic opportunities for those involved. Additionally, the coursework is manageable, yet still vigorous. Faculty are easily accessible, and class sized are small enough for professors to notice absences. Lastly, and most importantly, the school recognized its past shortcomings on its lack of diversity, and has worked tirelessly in recent years to improve this problem. Overall, the student-faculty relations and the opportunities the school offers makes it a great institution for anyone interested.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2018-03-30T20:19:28.844716Z","guid":"2039a4e4-5dac-4819-95d5-b4b5d0f8916c","rating":4},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":3.66}],"photos":{"default":{"crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/0e49d2a27206780f531f5030705b9e680d5a0bf8.jpg","MobileHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/771c4a2ccffab3b5cc94b2785e7d8826eb1c0be4.jpg"},"licenseName":"UNLICENSED"},"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-89.989187,35.154424,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-89.989187,35.154424,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.5977382875605817,"count":619},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Memphis, TN"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/rhodes-college/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"516e33a8-95ea-4eda-904c-bacb50f7a9f3","badge":{"display":"Best Colleges for Computer Science in America","ordinal":128,"total":494,"vanityURL":"best-colleges-for-computer-science"},"content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":true,"isPremium":true,"name":"Florida Institute of Technology","type":"College","url":"florida-institute-of-technology"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.6133},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":31582},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"1060-1260"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Niche User","body":"FIT is a diverse school based right on the Florida Space Coast that offers a world-class education in a variety of STEM fields from Mechanical Engineering to the Biological Sciences.

There's a whole week of activities in August before classes start specifically for incoming freshman to get them acclimated to the university and show them everything UK has to offer.  There are numerous tutoring services and most professors are flexible with their office hours to find a time that works for the student.  Almost everyday there's a different activity happening on campus, from goat yoga and Pinterest parties for stress relief, to live music and food to spend time with friends, to tailgates before sports games to support our Wildcats with the most spirit.

However, I would recommend that after freshman year, you live somewhere within walking distance to campus, because the parking here is absolutely awful and you will absolutely regret commuting to campus and spending nearly 2 hours looking for a parking spot everyday, even with a parking pass that costs hundreds of dollars. Also Dale Hall is a ridiculous building and if you have a class there, get there early because trying to make your way through the crowds in that building can sometimes take a while.

The professors here are incredibly intelligent and love to get to know the students as more than just a number. This is mainly due to the small class sizes, which I believe is one of the benefits of this institution. The professors are willing to work with you outside of class because they truly value your understanding of the subjects. I am continuously motivated to become a future educator by the professors that I have had and I can't wait to continue on in this career.

Overall, Baylor is a University that provides all who visit with an experience they can never forget.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2017-09-20T23:56:26.479527Z","guid":"d5d0fd60-eeed-4c65-946f-12b1204c8a4f","rating":5},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":4}],"photos":{"default":{"author":"idibri","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/2ffbeb044fb4d9170a13937957cb326174d59aa8.jpg","MobileHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/e93d522be30ba75eb00cbbde64288df09d2f9421.jpg","Thumbnail":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/65c27d7c0a6c701dc4d1560bd180cfb49d250372"},"licenseName":"CC BY ","licenseUrl":"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/2.0/","sourceUrl":"https://www.flickr.com/photos/idibri/15272187099/"},"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-97.119359,31.545956,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-97.119359,31.545956,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.702513604560767,"count":3859},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Waco, TX"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/baylor-university/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"362abb0c-db5a-4454-9775-f50a988c7c2e","badge":{"display":"Best Colleges for Computer Science in America","ordinal":141,"total":494,"vanityURL":"best-colleges-for-computer-science"},"content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"Miami University","type":"College","url":"miami-university"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.6538},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":20186},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"1130-1350"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Junior","body":"I love being a Miami student!

If you're hoping to pursue a career in business or fashion, this is a great school in Ohio to bust into that world. Miami alums are incredibly connected within the business world--we have countless alums that are CEOs, CMOs, etc. Additionally, we have a great fashion organization, MUF&D, that puts on the largest student-run fashion show in the US.

The campus is small but that's the beauty of it because all of the school's buildings are within a 10 minute walk from each other so there is no need to stress about getting too much exercise! There are countless activities and stores within walking and biking distance of the school if you decide to wander and explore the great city of Boston.

The library has resources from state of the art equipment, macs and PCs, digital media equipment with green screens, quiet study floors, a Starbucks, tutoring center, a writing center and so many more things. Central campus is very pretty and very green, with the MLK plaza in the middle and trees perfectly lined up.

If you are bored after a long day of classes, the best thing to do is to sit on the grass and relax. Cornell College campus scene is beautiful all year round, spring, summer, fall, winter, I never get sick of it. \nThe food is diverse, much much better than it used to be around 4-5 years ago. Now everyone can enjoy new variety of food everyday, including Asian, Latin, European food. \nMy friends on campus are friendly with LGBT, black and international, so the atmosphere makes everybody feel comfortable.
