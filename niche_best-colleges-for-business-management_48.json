It really made my college experience memorable to have such amazing professors that treated you like an individual. Even though it was memorable, it wasn't always in a good way. My Penn State GA advisor for my major gave me the wrong plan and I ended up having to go back an extra semester for one French III course that I didn't know I had to take. Penn State paid for me to go back, but because I was no longer considered a full-time student, my loans came due as soon as I received my degree.

I am an online student now, however I stay connected in various ways through the school. What I find the most appealing that even after all these years, the same professors are still working at the college. The school has a home like feel because of the atmosphere the campus offers. I highly recommend the University of Maine at Machias if you enjoy the outdoors, especially oceans. There may not be a lot of things to do in town because it is very rural. However, there is an abundance of outdoor activities that will be a once in a lifetime experience.

The academics, though limited, offered amazing career choices. The soccer field where I dreamed of playing was one like none I’ve ever seen. Situated in the mountain with scenic views that in the fall season looked like something out of a painting. \n     In the fall of 2016 my dream became reality as I began my life as an SVC student athlete. Academics and being part of a great woman’s soccer team made my first year all I had hoped It would be. The small campus fits my needs and the surrounding areas offer many opportunities for me to fulfill my wanderlust with hiking, snowboarding, mountain biking and many other adventurous activities.  Entering my fourth semester in a few weeks and I can’t wait to be back on campus, making more memories and fulfilling more dreams!","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2017-12-29T04:35:24.718367Z","guid":"e5a15237-35f0-4337-89ea-24ba0ed262f8","rating":5},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":2.33}],"photos":{"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-73.21866,42.867031,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-73.21866,42.867031,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.1494252873563218,"count":87},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Bennington, VT"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/southern-vermont-college/#scatterplot"}}]}
