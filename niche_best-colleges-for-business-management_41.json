My adviser is great and retention team is great as well. Any questions you have you can call or email for assistance; email is a great option for busy students that work during the day such as myself. I love this school, the book delivery system is also another bonus. Not having to worry about having the book or being able to afford the book is a great tool, they simply mail it to you with a return package and you drop it off at UPS once you are done.

Depending on the campus you attend, it can range from very safe to fairly safe. For the most part the professors are great and very helpful, they really try their best to make sure their students succeed and understand what is going on. Their academic center is hands down great! They have FREE tutoring sessions throughout the week, including Saturday. All of these tutors have a degree and are VERY helpful. They have not only helped me become successful, but many other students their service. The classrooms are up to date and the campuses are very clean for the most part. I felt safe being on the main campus because of the amount of security on campus.

It is a family-friendly oriented university. There are many amazing organizations you can join that helps you socially, academically, or however you decide to take that advantage as. At the time, it was the only school that offered a Forensic Science program, plus it is affordable! It is a small campus so it wasn't hard for me to learn my way around. It actually only took about 3-5 days to know majority of where everything is at. Fayetteville State has some caring staff and peers that help you succeed. There are many resources to take advantage of as well. Overall, Fayetteville State is an excellent university. I am able to maintain good grades, along with having fun and a social life. If I could go back and make a college decision again, I would still choose Fayetteville State.

The school is located in downtown and everything is close by! This school is mostly known for the medical and business field. Every other major is basically pointless. The school is expensive but it matters on how you use you opportunities and resources wisely. Overall the dorms are pretty big than SUNY colleges and their are no parties on campus unless your on the sports team or in some way affiliated with them.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2018-06-07T03:17:05.102286Z","guid":"d31d13b6-51a8-4895-b647-82b834a8eedc","rating":4},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":2.33}],"photos":{"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-73.980872,40.690134,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-73.980872,40.690134,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.461618257261411,"count":964},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Brooklyn, NY"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/long-island-university---brooklyn/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"fbc0bde8-b345-45cf-a8e4-732d5de6ed3a","content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"Southern Oregon University","type":"College","url":"southern-oregon-university"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.782},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":8939},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"900-1130"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Junior","body":"My experience here at SOU has gradually increased and has become the best decision of my life.

Two tour guides (students studying at Pratt) took us on a 2-hour tour, answering our questions while giving great information about the institution. The campus is beautiful, definitely a calm getaway from the busyness of New York city, with inspiring sculptures around a very green area. The studios looked very professional, and the security system is very fast and trustworthy.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2017-03-13T10:26:57.978533Z","guid":"4f1ab24f-5c39-4238-8c64-278153beb856","rating":5},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":3}],"photos":{"default":{"crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/a9c2d9435dc59eb1cce0c74b55d761176de4469b.jpg","MobileHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/0321a92de8191189baaa4627700f6a6bdc8ac853.jpg"},"licenseName":"UNLICENSED"},"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-73.962149,40.691154,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-73.962149,40.691154,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.4912985274431056,"count":747},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Brooklyn, NY"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/pratt-institute/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"0cc31d06-3ba9-44b1-b89f-d0bf57842ea2","content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":true,"isPremium":false,"name":"Motlow State Community College","type":"College","url":"motlow-state-community-college"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.422621},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":7611},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"790-1005"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Freshman","body":"The college is a small hometown college.
