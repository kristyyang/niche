There's free tutoring if needed\nUNH works with most study abroad programs. It's discovery credit system makes it easy for credits to transfer towards your major. \nFor food It's in the top 1% of USA. There's 3 dining halls as well as shops all around campus. It's unbelievable(trust me on this)\nD1 Aka sports events are crazy. Football/hockey is intense; there's huge tailgate parties\nGreek life and sports teams have their own houses so the parties are good.\nSo many clubs/orgs.

Greek life on this campus to me is one of the best in the country and one of the most wonderful organizations I've had the opportunity to be apart of. It not only provides an inclusiveness towards other organizations and the campus as a whole, but encourages students to work harder in both academia and community service. Along with Greek life this university has also provided many leadership opportunities that I wouldn't have had, had I gone somewhere else. While diversity on this campus tends to be lacking I was able to work with different multicultural organizations to change that aspect.

Coming into my freshman year of college I was extremely shy and avoidant but my professors and classmates definitely brought me out of my comfort zone in a way that I feel my absolute best and most confident, especially academically. The amount of resources offered here at TXST are helpful, there is always help around every corner! My favorite part about being a bobcat is the energy associated walking through TXST’s campus, someone is always giving out free food (always accept free food in college), people play music, programs are out in the Quad doing activities at times and the overall feeling from being a student here at Texas State is powerful. If I could restart from my freshman year, I wouldn’t change a thing. Becoming a bobcat at Texas State University was the best decision I’ve ever made, and I am grateful for my high level of education.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2018-02-01T02:28:09.441055Z","guid":"095031b9-5176-4791-a118-c0282146277c","rating":5},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":3.33}],"photos":{"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-97.936392,29.889202,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-97.936392,29.889202,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.7317608337904553,"count":5469},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"San Marcos, TX"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/texas-state-university/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"1055a5cc-2b9a-4c13-87d0-9f5e4863dba8","badge":{"display":"Best Colleges in America","ordinal":401,"total":1644,"vanityURL":"best-colleges"},"content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":true,"isPremium":false,"name":"Asbury University","type":"College","url":"asbury-university"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.696},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":23750},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"1000-1240"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Senior","body":"I've never felt so at home, accepted, and free to be myself.

Professors are intelligent, funny, and made learning feel less like work. Definitely recommend the senior capstone project required by several majors because it gives you the research and writing skills needed to do a master's thesis project closely supervised by faculty.\n\nStudent body is quiet but has a lot of neat interests and passions.

It really helped me succeed in my classes and introduced me to so many friends!","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2018-05-17T17:11:47.505877Z","guid":"764d97a0-7b0d-40ac-8e5d-87e63c5ee5fa","rating":5},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":3}],"photos":{"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-71.527356,41.484691,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-71.527356,41.484691,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.4363057324840764,"count":2198},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Kingston, RI"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/university-of-rhode-island/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"b307df89-aadc-4d83-b6fa-8be14b52a06a","badge":{"display":"Best Colleges in America","ordinal":370,"total":1644,"vanityURL":"best-colleges"},"content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"California State University - Chico","type":"College","url":"california-state-university---chico"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.6525},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":13645},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"880-1100"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Sophomore","body":"I've just started at CSU Chico; I'm going to be a sophomore! I can't believe my first year of college is over! I'm so thankful that I chose to attend CSU Chico. The campus is completely gorgeous with tall elegant trees, bright flowers, and the babbling Big Chico Creek cutting through. All the classes I've taken so far have been extremely interesting and well taught. The only complaints I have would be with the administration. It seems like they don't really listen to the students very well. This is specifically targeted towards the recent decision of the president of the school decided to enact tuition fee increases despite overwhelming negative student sentiment. It would be nice if the admin actually listened to us.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2018-05-29T05:03:53.710412Z","guid":"cc9a8f0a-03ed-40c8-a3a7-b156a21be841","rating":4},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":3.33}],"photos":{"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-121.846333,39.728003,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-121.846333,39.728003,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.649438202247191,"count":2225},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Chico, CA"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/california-state-university---chico/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"b75734e0-c688-4d11-9b8d-8245eac76a78","badge":{"display":"Best Colleges in America","ordinal":740,"total":1644,"vanityURL":"best-colleges"},"content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"Middle Tennessee State University","type":"College","url":"middle-tennessee-state-university"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.6861},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":11744},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"950-1160"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Graduate Student","body":"MTSU is a fantastic school. I attended undergrad at a much smaller university in a rural area but the transition to graduate school here has been relatively simple.  I love the closed campus and for me with night classes, parking is relatively close to the buildings and easily accessed. The professors I've had so far are stellar. Even though the school is bigger, the MAcc program still has smaller classes and the professors really take the time to get to know you and assist you if you need it. The food options on campus are also awesome. Coming from the smaller university where the only options were a cafeteria and one small restaurant, I love having a Chick-fil-A or Subway I can hit up before class. I also love the library layout and booth seating. I would love to see more booths put in!","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2018-03-04T23:41:24.684583Z","guid":"426ceeb0-db58-4314-a7df-df991ebe2dc5","rating":5},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":3}],"photos":{"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-86.362094,35.849139,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-86.362094,35.849139,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.570335882939807,"count":3007},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Murfreesboro, TN"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/middle-tennessee-state-university/#scatterplot"}}]}
