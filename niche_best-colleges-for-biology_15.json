Most of my peers who are more than qualified for positions are still struggling to find jobs.\n\nMy experiences in the biology department were overall very good, though I would like to see more variety of classes offered, and more internship options. The teachers were great and some of the courses were challenging (genetics, physiology). Do not wait until your last 2 semesters to find a senior seminar project and take genetics/physiology!

Professors are very engaged and genuinely care about the students. Very small class sizes, which creates a close-knit environment. The tuition is high, but it is a very good quality education. One complaint is the meal plan. There are currency 3 different meal plan options. They differ in the number of meals per week and amount of DBD's usable in the campus cafe'. However, each meal plan is the same cost! You cannot get a cheaper meal plan until you move out of the regular dorm.  The meal plans are expensive. Overall, great college!

The Jesuit education provided by Le Moyne is thorough and all around excellent. I also commuted to Le Moyne and I found that my professors were always understanding and accomodating if I were ever in the situation where I wouldn’t be able to attend class, such as weather conditions and other external forces that I wouldn’t be able to control.

The classes are all academically demanding, so as long as you try and do your work, you should be fine! Student life is pretty good as the RA's and CA's, as well as the clubs and organizations around school, come up with some fun events and activities that everyone can enjoy! It honestly is very easy to make friends, especially if you live in the dorms. UST offers some great academic programs and they are very generous when awarding scholarships. Overall, the University of St. Thomas is a great school. As with every school, it does have its pros and cons, but all-in-all, your time spent here is going to be well worth it.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2016-12-20T17:36:38.487154Z","guid":"e33a7126-7e25-4d5c-a9d0-37b691ca0c80","rating":5},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":3.33}],"photos":{"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-95.394178,29.738113,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-95.394178,29.738113,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.5983050847457627,"count":590},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Houston, TX"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/university-of-st-thomas---texas/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"a1f6c86a-749f-4b4a-b3e1-037c623d9950","badge":{"display":"Best Colleges for Biology in America","ordinal":378,"total":954,"vanityURL":"best-colleges-for-biology"},"content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":true,"isPremium":true,"name":"Harding University","type":"College","url":"harding-university"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.7018},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":18372},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"980-1220"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Freshman","body":"Although I have only been at Harding University for one semester, I cannot imagine attending a better school!

There's so many places to go to receive help, it's very reassuring especially when you're having a bad day. Next, the campus and the dorms are nice. The campus is very large which means a lot of walking, but it's not that bad because there's such beautiful architecture and landscaping to look at. The dorms are small and neat, but there's air conditioning which is a major plus. I got to sit through a real college class, which at Hofstra are relatively small. The food at Hofstra has a pretty good selection, but nothing crazy. There are Starbucks, Dunkin Donuts, Subways, Sbarros, and many other places to grab a bite to eat.

The class sizes are also pretty small making the class experience seem less intimidating and you actually feel like you will contribute something to the class instead of being \"one out of many\".","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2018-04-19T05:52:26.400792Z","guid":"59d86f41-44bb-4030-93c8-1b185f994807","rating":4},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":3.33}],"photos":{"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-84.775275,43.591137,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-84.775275,43.591137,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.6471045472211427,"count":2573},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Mount Pleasant, MI"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/central-michigan-university/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"a76d318b-acc7-4dc6-8ef7-e55f2db86e52","badge":{"display":"Best Colleges for Biology in America","ordinal":386,"total":954,"vanityURL":"best-colleges-for-biology"},"content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"Rocky Mountain College","type":"College","url":"rocky-mountain-college"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.6207},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":19412},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"878-1106"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Alum","body":"I loved how small Rocky was- -I made excellent connections with my teachers, which opened up a ton of opportunities for me! The surrounding city was small and old-fashioned, which isn't my style but might suit other people quite well.  Furthermore, for coming out with less debt than I would have had at my state school, I'd say it was a great deal! Anyone who's satisfied with a basic degree (art, bio, etc) would probably do well here.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2018-05-14T01:09:20.373519Z","guid":"07ba53af-6ad5-40b2-b758-5774d3009232","rating":4},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":3}],"photos":{"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-108.553899,45.796765,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-108.553899,45.796765,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.46,"count":300},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Billings, MT"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/rocky-mountain-college/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"f7c82626-39cb-4478-b978-50c7675d093c","badge":{"display":"Best Colleges for Biology in America","ordinal":388,"total":954,"vanityURL":"best-colleges-for-biology"},"content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"Roanoke College","type":"College","url":"roanoke-college"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.7304},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":29999},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"970-1200"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Junior","body":"Great campus... great professors...great curriculum...overall, a great school! I came into this school having no direction or plan and it wasn't long before Roanoke helped me discover my passion. Small class sizes make it so easy to develop connections with both your classmates and professors. You aren't just a number here, and, personally, these connections have helped me grow and recognize my strengths and talents. In return, I have been given so many wonderful opportunities at this school that have truly prepared me for life after graduation. I would recommend Roanoke College in a heartbeat.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2017-11-28T16:42:23.7757Z","guid":"ea476743-e41a-4926-81b0-9a29f34ee366","rating":5},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":3.33}],"photos":{"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-80.056433,37.29686,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-80.056433,37.29686,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.611940298507463,"count":670},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Salem, VA"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/roanoke-college/#scatterplot"}}]}
