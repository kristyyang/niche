There are also many great opportunities available for personal growth such as joining clubs, studying aboard, and fellowships. The career service here is amazing as well. They help critique your resume for you and help you find internships during the summer. As for academic advising, they help you set up a 4-year plan of what classes you will be taking each semester and will adjust if you plan to study abroad. One thing I would like to see improvements on is racial diversity within the staff/faculty and nonfaculty members. I think it is important that there is diversity within professors and nonfaculty members because some students may feel more comfortable with a professor or staff of color.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2018-04-30T19:57:22.19563Z","guid":"4c1841c2-5fa9-4150-92be-52a2732c9974","rating":4},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade"}],"photos":{"default":{"crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/520d9efed0eeea242193c283dabeaf0dcc1c6a30.jpg","MobileHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/d12e9732c97a347df873d76f7efc47553fcd957f.jpg"},"licenseName":"UNLICENSED"},"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-94.32,45.56,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-94.32,45.56,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.65,"count":580},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"St. Joseph, MN"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/college-of-saint-benedict/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"288a84cb-18f4-424d-a372-8ff0c7955506","content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"Governors State University","type":"College","url":"governors-state-university"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.413},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":16143},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"855-1070"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Junior","body":"I'm a transfer student into GSU.

I had the ability to be a student-athlete, member of multiple clubs/organizations, study for my bachelor's degree, and work part-time. The faculty and staff were very helpful, especially when it came down to \"crunch time\" and finding a job. I graduated GMercyU on May 12th and secured a teaching position May 14th! I highly recommend Gwynedd Mercy University, especially to education majors!","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2018-06-01T17:51:17.614009Z","guid":"f66a2144-f898-43c8-a1bf-7f15d77f5644","rating":5},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":2.66}],"photos":{"default":{"crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/ed57fd1f18424d3dc297eece106be6fd4aa8e491.jpg","MobileHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/70273016084574b201463fb8679041c59d4a8801.jpg"},"licenseName":"UNLICENSED"},"mapbox_header":{"crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-75.238052,40.197566,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-75.238052,40.197566,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"UNLICENSED"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.5063291139240507,"count":316},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Gwynedd Valley, PA"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/gwynedd-mercy-university/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"a56a9a3d-390e-4431-a256-82b6aa1b779f","content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"Concord University","type":"College","url":"concord-university"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.8115},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":7928},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"870-1090"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Junior","body":"Concord university not only offers a wide variety of up to date majors, wide branch selection and qualified professors but it also provides the student with a high quality residence experience that makes the student want to be there constantly; in addition, the athletic department highly focuses on each sport depending on the respective season to ensure that each sport is having an equal amount of support.\nAnd for non-student athletes the SGA introduces a long list of activities that students will not only enjoy but learn something from them.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2017-12-29T01:59:31.110101Z","guid":"e637376a-7d9e-4160-83b7-ba5cb07cec8a","rating":5},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":2}],"photos":{"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-81.005694,37.423854,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-81.005694,37.423854,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.3097949886104785,"count":439},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Athens, WV"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/concord-university/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"5204571f-03a8-48f8-a5a7-6e1fd4bb708c","content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":true,"isPremium":false,"name":"Southwest Baptist University","type":"College","url":"southwest-baptist-university"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.8967},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":16782},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"860-1100"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Graduate Student","body":"I am currently in the physical therapy program at SBU and I love it!

The professors are top notch and always willing to give you your time.  Online courses are tough but their curriculum makes it tolerable.  The professors are easy to reach and provide ease to contact if needed.  There are writing labs and math labs available 24/7.  My experience at IU has been more than pleasant.  I have two classes remaining and would recommend IU to anyone interested in online classes. Because I live in Nashville, TN,  it was hard to be involved with any campus activity, but, from what I see in emails, IU has plenty of activities and always step up to help their local community.
