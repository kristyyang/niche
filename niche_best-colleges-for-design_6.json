Coming into my freshman year of college I was extremely shy and avoidant but my professors and classmates definitely brought me out of my comfort zone in a way that I feel my absolute best and most confident, especially academically. The amount of resources offered here at TXST are helpful, there is always help around every corner! My favorite part about being a bobcat is the energy associated walking through TXST’s campus, someone is always giving out free food (always accept free food in college), people play music, programs are out in the Quad doing activities at times and the overall feeling from being a student here at Texas State is powerful. If I could restart from my freshman year, I wouldn’t change a thing. Becoming a bobcat at Texas State University was the best decision I’ve ever made, and I am grateful for my high level of education.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2018-02-01T02:28:09.441055Z","guid":"095031b9-5176-4791-a118-c0282146277c","rating":5},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":3.33}],"photos":{"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-97.936392,29.889202,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-97.936392,29.889202,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.7317608337904553,"count":5469},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"San Marcos, TX"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/texas-state-university/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"f17288c0-fbf3-467a-aedf-564e38d44608","content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":true,"isPremium":false,"name":"Cabrini University","type":"College","url":"cabrini-university"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.7106},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":24958},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"880-1050"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Junior","body":"My overall experience at Cabrini University has been good so far.

One of the biggest things that I think Cabrini needs to change is the size of the campus. Yes I understand that it is easier said than done.

The campus is small and everything is easily accessible, no running across massive campus to get from class to class. The class sizes were small so it allowed for Professors to teach on a more personal basis. The professors were almost all  fair and excellent as well, there was only one I would complain about but is no longer employed. The people are friendly, however the population did not seem very diverse. There were plenty of places to relax or study as a commuting student, and parking spaces were not too bad to locate for the most part.

It is such a relaxing environment and you never get bored of looking at that view. Quinnipiac was a very convenient choice for me because I was planning on being a commuter and the campus is close to home. In my second year here, I can say with certainty that everyone here is so friendly and always willing to help you. The professors are amazing and they will do everything they can to make sure you are understanding the concepts and succeeding academically. Another interesting thing about Quinnipiac is that it has many clubs and organizations available. In this way, each student can definitely find something that matches their hobbies and interests. And lastly, I am glad I chose Quinnipiac because it offers such an interesting major, which is Behavioral Neuroscience. I recently declared it and I can't wait to explore it further more in the months to come!","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2017-10-02T17:40:43.034339Z","guid":"3bd64d3d-094c-49df-942d-ca0a22242104","rating":5},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":3.33}],"photos":{"default":{"crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/c961c711b4b64bfd61847d72217c707792e082b6.jpg","MobileHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/0aeb2577dea0abc6367c8101d8e600c38c3a97f5.jpg"},"licenseName":"UNLICENSED"},"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-72.895542,41.419527,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-72.895542,41.419527,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.507514450867052,"count":1730},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Hamden, CT"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/quinnipiac-university/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"5198060a-40a9-4ead-830a-eed06398709e","content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"Radford University","type":"College","url":"radford-university"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.812},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":14084},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"890-1060"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Freshman","body":"Radford University is the perfect school to help new student embrace their personality and not be afraid to try new things.

Kent State has amazing faculty and staff that I believe are truly there to help you. From custodians to our president, I have had nothing but great experiences. Our sports/recreational teams and facilities are top tear or currently being renovated to get there. Kent State is always improving and trying to be the best. Cons, being that it is such a huge university parking can be a hassle and the walking can be tiresome. There is a wide range of people there so of course a few aren't going to be the most pleasant.

However, I’ve noticed the freshman student body is  more diverse than I expected and the school is not as big as I thought. I see many of the people in my hall around campus. The class sizes are small 15-25 students. The city of Oneonta is cute and transportation to the mall and other main spots is easily accessible. The RA’s are always there to help me with anything big or small. The freshman dorms seem to be the newest! The food is okay, it’s not moms cooking but there’s a lot of selections and 3 main dining halls around campus. Professors have overall been very supportive and helpful. Overall my experience has been very good.

SHU has representation from every state in the US and 70 countries. While based in Catholicism, SHU has almost a 50% diversity rate and welcomes people of any faith or belief system. Seton Hall athletics is one of the best parts of campus life. With 14 D1 sports teams there is always a game to watch and cheer on. The men's basketball team plays at the Prudential Center in Newark, NJ and they play in the Big East Conference. Going to basketball games is a highlight of the school year!\nOverall, social life on campus is awesome. There is always stuff to do on campus during the week and the weekends. Greek life is available on campus but will not make or break your experience.

The professors here are okay, the reason why is they are very close-minded and authoritative. You cannot question their judgment, and they are not open to new ideas. The campus buildings and dorms are kept clean and updated - which is a huge plus to recompense their weaknesses. The student life here is dull since most people are commuters and the students only hang around with people from their high school. The food here is from good to average in some days. Finally, the academics here is excellent since it has tons of academic variations along with professors that are passionate about their specialized field. All in all, it is a great university!","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2018-02-15T08:51:05.921577Z","guid":"f40471ec-bf6b-4505-8722-41ae61551a3b","rating":4},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":3}],"photos":{"default":{"crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/5e2e951c3244d7c28ea08295d241080c6aa40fcb.jpg","MobileHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/801ab8e3233e1b781a4f8acbe3cadbb9a0302269.jpg"},"licenseName":"UNLICENSED"},"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-74.199455,40.859233,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-74.199455,40.859233,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.463615903975994,"count":2666},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Montclair, NJ"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/montclair-state-university/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"9c79dc64-8bb0-4f39-abfb-88d2b69644d7","content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":true,"isPremium":false,"name":"Greenville University","type":"College","url":"greenville-university"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.5782},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":18356},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"840-1080"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Junior","body":"Greenville, yes, is in the middle of corn fields in southern Illinois. But our campus contains such diversity that you run into people different than you all the time. Campus activities promote integration of all students, from athletes to bookish types, from African American students to South Korean students.\nThe one thing that many people are weary about is the lifestyle statement, which prohibits many of the 'typical college' activities (smoking, drinking, sex on campus, etc). As an RA, my interactions with the lifestyle statement have given me a broad perspective of the pros and cons of having such an agreement. As a Christian community I think it is imperative that we hold our students to a wholesome standard. However, for those students who do not practice Christianity, I have seen isolation and exclusion on occasion.\nOverall, I love Greenville and am content with my choice for my educational advancement.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2018-02-28T01:52:25.072542Z","guid":"2485c9ef-88ae-471d-846d-63a7487891ef","rating":4},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":3}],"photos":{"default":{"crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/fdd4165fcee1e058a86cf3a51f22704d6bad62b1.jpg","MobileHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/8642a02b748cd3ca2b270e88dceaada520d88779.jpg"},"licenseName":"UNLICENSED"},"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-89.4089,38.8928,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-89.4089,38.8928,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.458974358974359,"count":390},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Greenville, IL"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/greenville-university/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"06666c39-6e59-4521-8779-9114e0db10a2","content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"Oklahoma Baptist University","type":"College","url":"oklahoma-baptist-university"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.6011},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":18968},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"920-1165"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Niche User","body":"Oklahoma Baptist University is very great when it comes to taking care of their students, whether academically or financially.
