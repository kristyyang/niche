My first overall impression was that it was only for crazy outgoing people. However, now going into my third semester, I love it! The community around Alverno, along with the staff and women who attend this school are amazing and supportive. Alverno does not have grades, we have a pass or fail system. At first it was scary with that grading system,however, I really like it because the professors provide lengthy feedback on every assignment. The feedback tells us what we did well on and how we can improve our skills. With the professors giving indivial feedback, it provides us with a chance to form a better relationship with them rather then being defined by a grade.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2018-05-20T00:20:48.016793Z","guid":"67f3bb79-6cf7-43c0-b21c-942113753f97","rating":5},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":3.33}],"photos":{"default":{"crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/d0bbe0867b2fdaa2c8e63c8b67d2162613d78376.jpg","MobileHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/7571bf3c3309dc594f681e8f29704d68d9ee749f.jpg"},"licenseName":"UNLICENSED"},"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-87.965498,42.983518,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-87.965498,42.983518,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.7812166488794023,"count":937},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Milwaukee, WI"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/alverno-college/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"89ea0886-4d53-4397-aeb1-5ffbb83b8a78","badge":{"display":"Best Colleges in America","ordinal":71,"total":1644,"vanityURL":"best-colleges"},"content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":true,"isPremium":true,"name":"Bryn Mawr College","type":"College","url":"bryn-mawr-college"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.3994},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":31900},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"1220-1450"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Freshman","body":"It's very pretty and the atmosphere is super chill. The professors are really understanding for the most part and they all are very knowledgeable in their department. Also the Bi-Co is a pretty neat program at the school. We could also take classes at Swarthmore and UPenn even though that's more uncommon but if you really want to do it you can. The students can get a little rattled when it comes to politics and it's really liberal, some people like that others don't, just depends on who you talk to. The campus is sooo beautiful all throughout the year! And housing is one the best parts because most of the rooms are really big and you can get a single your sophomore year. The college also does a good job at matching roommates for first years. It can get a little boring because it's in a suburb but Philly close enough that you could go into the city every weekend if you wanted to.

Its a great school to start your first year if you are financially unstable. Its also not too big but small enough for a comfortable settle. Another thing I like about it is, they offer a bridge program with the University of Kansas so you can take classes there at a cheaper price than actually going to KU. The students and staff are super friendly and will go beyond measure to make sure you are successful!
