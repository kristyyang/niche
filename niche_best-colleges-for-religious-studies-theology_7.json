Hunter offers a plethora of majors to choose from as well as different clubs to keep students engaged. There are also activities and events held on campus. The workload may be overwhelming at times but I regard it as excellent preparation for graduate school and an opportunity to challenge myself. The location of Hunter is convenient; it is located in the city so your choices don't fall short when it comes to food. Hunter has a library on nine floors. My complaint is that when you attend Hunter no one tells you anything unless you ask many, many questions! I know several people who took the incorrect class for their major, wasting time and money. Additionally, I feel that in large lecture halls with more than 100 students, there isn't a chance to receive individualized attention. The classroom size should be smaller so professors can focus on every students' needs and struggles.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2018-01-16T22:01:16.773582Z","guid":"61dee6aa-64ee-4526-9449-0dd06859694f","rating":4},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":3}],"photos":{"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-73.964795,40.768669,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-73.964795,40.768669,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.439636752136752,"count":1872},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"New York, NY"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/cuny-hunter-college/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"1eb2ecf6-73b2-402e-b16f-de8d65a0d1f6","content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"Tabor College","type":"College","url":"tabor-college"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.5594},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":22420},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"830-1010"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Sophomore","body":"It feels like home.

Ripon really prepared me for Medical School and the job market. What really makes Ripon stand out is in connecting students with opportunities to build one's resume in college so they become excellent applicants for post-grad education and in the job market.  You have to actively try to not become involved in research, campus jobs, internships, or other resume building activities, while being a student at Ripon. The fact that I and several of my classmates were accepted into Medical School right out of college is significant. This is becoming increasing difficult to build a sufficient resume to be a competitive applicant after just 4 years of college.

It's challenging (especially if you do the Honors College), but worth your while. THe study abroad programs are EXCELLENT. I did 2 of them myself, and definitely recommend it-- they find a way to finance whatever study abroad you want to do, through their scholarship office. \nI only take 1 star away because I was a commuter and did not enjoy VCU as much as the residential students.

To summarize, the University of Arizona is an amazing opportunity for anyone looking to get a world-class education in an environment where employers often come directly to you.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2018-03-01T03:25:26.123698Z","guid":"092f1096-7bb8-4ba8-852f-05209f1ef07f","rating":4},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":3.66}],"photos":{"default":{"author":"iagoarchangel","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/50d9d513c48381c6ba4939908c60bbd3ac3a4631.jpg","MobileHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/0c9c05adf4b9e9ce85277fdbe92468b57d06a2e7.jpg","Thumbnail":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/375760a6d8ec09f2b2b89cb9f9f2d14e6e577f2e"},"licenseName":"CC BY-SA","licenseUrl":"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/","sourceUrl":"https://www.flickr.com/photos/iagoarchangel/8608390310/"},"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-110.950769,32.232071,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-110.950769,32.232071,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.7181506849315067,"count":5840},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Tucson, AZ"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/university-of-arizona/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"edbb65ad-28c6-4c76-99c5-2a6ca129c8bc","content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"Northland College","type":"College","url":"northland-college"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.5401},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":18951},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"980-1105"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Freshman","body":"I love Northland College because of the outdoor aspect.

I could never picture myself spending these four years anywhere else!","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2018-05-25T21:29:00.356923Z","guid":"4afb08d2-dc9c-463e-94d0-1d4fd5f5bbc9","rating":5},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":3.66}],"photos":{"default":{"author":"ucfblog","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/ca592e3988773107868625cb52360dd817f49cbf.jpg","MobileHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/c9923b9bf52c08d3e5bfc321d300e65797240a59.jpg","Thumbnail":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/5e70139314570d477f12540df95a6df7f128fbdf"},"licenseName":"CC BY-SA","licenseUrl":"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/","sourceUrl":"https://www.flickr.com/photos/ucfblog/4698157590/"},"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-81.198805,28.60106,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-81.198805,28.60106,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.765588350273651,"count":20464},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Orlando, FL"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/university-of-central-florida/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"bc90e2b6-e112-43ed-ac5c-3548829ea3dd","content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"University of Texas - Austin","type":"College","url":"university-of-texas---austin"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.4037},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":16010},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"1140-1410"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Junior","body":"In one sentence:there.is.something.for.everyone! UT Austin is simply the best in making a large school feeling immediately smaller by the countless communities you can jump right into. From political to adventurous student organizations, to meeting the very brightest professors and students in your chosen field, you will never cease to be amazed by the unlimited amount of opportunities available to you. For instance, I am a double major in Government and International Relations and Global Studies and am continuously amazed at the amount of programs, events, lectures , courses, and books available just for students in those majors. Your college's department of Career Services will blow you away as well, they will provide any and all resources to ensure your success after graduation. Most of all, UT is a highly respected university in the state of Texas and beyond, a degree from UT will go a very long way! I highly recommend studying here.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2018-04-04T20:57:10.298437Z","guid":"1b42f115-4293-493e-ab3c-4ebb9fead894","rating":5},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":4.33}],"photos":{"default":{"author":"jrandallc","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/062118de6b330627760d55de6c32cf824efa040b.jpg","MobileHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/8af2b0aa0e38489ab3331f7d629df02edec81728.jpg","Thumbnail":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/154967d69077062224951037e47fe52285fdde61"},"licenseName":"CC BY-SA","licenseUrl":"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/","sourceUrl":"https://www.flickr.com/photos/jrandallc/5207440826/"},"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-97.737279,30.284733,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-97.737279,30.284733,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.9090425531914894,"count":5640},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Austin, TX"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/university-of-texas---austin/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"c494ce31-603e-46e3-a477-a03dae81c1be","content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":true,"isPremium":true,"name":"Rutgers University – New Brunswick","type":"College","url":"rutgers-university--new-brunswick"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.5694},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":15614},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"1110-1350"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Senior","body":"Academically, Rutgers is an excellent university. The Philosophy department is one of the best in the country and the German department is fairly small but offers a variety of courses. I was also fortunate enough to study abroad in Germany through Rutgers. There are  scholarship opportunities to offset expenses, and my experience was incredible! The bus system used to transport students from one campus to another is unfortunately sub-par. The drivers take frequent and long breaks, which inconveniences students trying to get to class. A majority of buses themselves don't seem to be well maintained, either, and the bus schedule is unreliable. The quality and variety of the dining hall food is OK, depending on which you go to. There is a lot of cultural and racial diversity on campus, and many different types of course studies, clubs, events, etc. to choose from. Over all, Rutgers is a pretty good school, but one should always be prepared for annoyances.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2018-05-30T18:21:16.015754Z","guid":"01a39b76-f2d9-4942-99de-dbfff1bfa771","rating":4},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":4}],"photos":{"default":{"crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/63edd28c8b5adced9098fd93cc2044f1a1013b1e.jpg","MobileHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/ac486ae5a7a7c83d89cc83347b9440903d55d122.jpg","Thumbnail":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/ab0e0070a7e3c8308c08484d2c5a901dd37b097f"},"licenseName":"UNLICENSED"},"mapbox_header":{"crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-74.45051,40.503796,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-74.45051,40.503796,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"UNLICENSED"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.5708023632551935,"count":5247},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Piscataway, NJ"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/rutgers-university--new-brunswick/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"ae6d35c8-9988-4c35-a1a7-5f622ddc38d3","content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":true,"isPremium":false,"name":"Indiana University - Bloomington","type":"College","url":"indiana-university---bloomington"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.7872},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":12621},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"1060-1290"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Freshman","body":"Indiana Universities campus gives you the feeling of living in a small city. It's still small enough to see friends around campus, but big enough to give students the sense of freedom every young adult is looking for when leaving home for the first time. With that, the architecture is beautiful. The hilly streets and tree covered parks add to the breath taking sights as well. It has a great variety of majors, including some of the highest ranked schools in the nation: Kelly, Jacobs, and a few others. Indiana University also includes a number of outstanding graduate programs that have been ranked among the best in the United States. On top of the outstanding scenery and large variety of academics, Indiana University also offers tons of great social groups. This includes a very large Greek life community and practically any club you can think of. Overall, Indiana University will give you a great College Experience!","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2018-03-06T22:10:54.007694Z","guid":"67882c2b-1d0a-4901-b349-6af0c06d2f01","rating":5},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":4}],"photos":{"default":{"crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/384624f1a768b1f1105a87831eb2048f11386291.jpg","MobileHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/4ba85fc5e54092babd4be7cab06641c06ce27a3b.jpg","Thumbnail":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/c349823e87fe38116f01e646076db14a1fa65fea"},"licenseName":"UNLICENSED"},"mapbox_header":{"crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-86.526904,39.166383,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-86.526904,39.166383,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"UNLICENSED"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.744977546679272,"count":4231},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Bloomington, IN"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/indiana-university---bloomington/#scatterplot"}}]}
