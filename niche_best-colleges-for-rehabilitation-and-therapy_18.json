Depending on the campus you attend, it can range from very safe to fairly safe. For the most part the professors are great and very helpful, they really try their best to make sure their students succeed and understand what is going on. Their academic center is hands down great! They have FREE tutoring sessions throughout the week, including Saturday. All of these tutors have a degree and are VERY helpful. They have not only helped me become successful, but many other students their service. The classrooms are up to date and the campuses are very clean for the most part. I felt safe being on the main campus because of the amount of security on campus.  I do recommend future students or transfer students to attend Southwest because it won't burn a hole in your financial budget, and the professors and staff make you feel at home.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2018-05-25T14:04:12.301051Z","guid":"81116483-ae9b-4262-8033-79930883bad2","rating":4},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":2}],"photos":{"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-90.036543,35.137577,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-90.036543,35.137577,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.4922600619195046,"count":646},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"2 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Memphis, TN"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/southwest-tennessee-community-college/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"5f671ba6-dd85-42dd-bbee-53d04c2c02dd","content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":true,"isPremium":true,"name":"Xavier University","type":"College","url":"xavier-university"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.6858},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":27757},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"1010-1190"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Sophomore","body":"Xavier is a close knit community that truly cares for one another.

The diversity is also very good, as an LGBT student, it's very accepting here and I appreciate it a lot. As for race and socioeconomic backgrounds, it's diverse in those aspects as well!

Bethel is a place that if you were coming from a small town or school then you would do just fine with that adjustment factor.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2018-04-24T18:32:33.226968Z","guid":"0db29dac-9f55-40cd-969e-ed932e44c955","rating":4},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":2.33}],"photos":{"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-88.516162,36.139271,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-88.516162,36.139271,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.615,"count":400},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"McKenzie, TN"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/bethel-university---tennessee/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"7c430f2d-150d-4910-a9ba-e05debe336d7","content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"Ashland University","type":"College","url":"ashland-university"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.7247},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":20601},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"956-1173"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Junior","body":"There are many things that I did like about Ashland University as well as a few downfalls. First, there are a lot of positive aspects about academics. I liked that there were small class sizes, lots of hand-on-experience in classes, no TAs, and you could easily build relationships with professors. Another positive is that the dining hall has an excellent selection of food and is top rated in the country. I liked that there was many ways to get involved on campus such as Greek life, Volunteer work, and other clubs and organizations, as well as athletics. The Rec Center was also extremely nice. Downfalls of Ashland include a lack of parking (and lots of parking tickets), the fact that it is a dry campus, and poor quality in housing/dorms. The dorms are mostly small, old, and many do not have air conditioning.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2018-01-04T20:41:20.901223Z","guid":"94458c53-0abe-47d9-b32a-eb48312e56ad","rating":4},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":3}],"photos":{"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-82.320621,40.860987,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-82.320621,40.860987,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.6349924585218703,"count":663},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Ashland, OH"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/ashland-university/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"d955a136-6936-4e62-ba06-42c34956b4db","content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":true,"isPremium":false,"name":"Colorado State University - Pueblo","type":"College","url":"colorado-state-university---pueblo"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.9638},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":12887},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"870-1060"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Freshman","body":"I have met so many people and made a lot of new friends, including my roommate.

On that note I enjoyed each class of mine, and they all consisted of a decent amount of learners who for the most part, were all there to earn a higher education. Two things that I would like changed is the amount of attention that is needed between the Advisors and Financial Aid. They both are major aspects to my learning, but I found that they both don’t know anything about each other so there was a lot of back and forth between offices I had to do.

AUM provide many opportunities to get involved on campus so that your voice can be heard. One of my favorite features that AUM is the learning resources.  They have many useful resources that can be used to get help outside of classes. If I had to change anything about Auburn University at Montgomery, I would change the food options and tuition fees. The food here is good, but also could be better.  As far as tuition, I think they should provide more scholarships for students who pay out of pocket. When choosing a college,   it is important to feel like you have made the best decision. At AUM, my decision, I believe hascollegbeen fulfilled. Overall, my experience at AUM has been non-complaint and decent. I am very excited to see where AUM take me in the near future!","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2018-04-30T21:05:39.579125Z","guid":"13b75947-7d59-4d3a-ae27-bd5fc0ee8ba5","rating":5},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":2.66}],"photos":{"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-86.177351,32.369939,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-86.177351,32.369939,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.567140600315956,"count":633},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Montgomery, AL"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/auburn-university---montgomery/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"737ac7f1-8cb2-497b-957b-fbb2ff7d6941","content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"Baldwin Wallace University","type":"College","url":"baldwin-wallace-university"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.5973},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":22326},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"950-1200"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Sophomore","body":"BW is great! As a mid-year transfer student I was really nervous having to start everything over again. I went from a huge state school to a very small school. The faculty & staff are very kind. My professors know me by name and want what's best for me, in & outside of the classroom. From understanding the course work to finding an internship or getting involved on campus, they truly make an effort to make sure that we are taking advantage of all the opportunities that are provided here at Baldwin Wallace University.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2017-03-09T19:53:11.024626Z","guid":"b351ab97-ef61-430c-a2d6-52a89f5939d1","rating":4},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":3.66}],"photos":{"default":{"crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/d31a9707b8a305eeafd3074f9c59952ee328a857.jpg","MobileHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/aa5aac8511a626728cb9f3b950dd44170e525c14.jpg"},"licenseName":"UNLICENSED"},"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-81.849112,41.373938,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-81.849112,41.373938,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.516298633017876,"count":951},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Berea, OH"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/baldwin-wallace-university/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"30b950f3-af18-4feb-91a4-83c34f001ac2","content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"Cedarville University","type":"College","url":"cedarville-university"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.6906},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":22849},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"1080-1310"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Freshman","body":"I absolutely love Cedarville! It's been an amazing experience so far and I can't wait to spend the next three years here! The professors are incredible and care about the students more than they care about their academic journals and whatever else professors do. They will work with you, help you, and do absolutely everything in their power to make sure you succeed. \nThe quality of education is also amazing. I've learned so much and I am actually enjoying it. Many Christian schools tend to sacrifice quality of education for making everything \"christian\", Cedarville does not do this. At Cedarville they take education seriously and teach at a high academic level.\nOver all, Cedarville is an excellent school and a great choice.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2017-12-28T19:25:28.707719Z","guid":"b62ad6e7-5668-4b9e-b726-a8dc8d8ad8d0","rating":4},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":3.33}],"photos":{"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-83.812098,39.750338,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-83.812098,39.750338,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.8205882352941174,"count":1020},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Cedarville, OH"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/cedarville-university/#scatterplot"}}]}
