With a campus in the \"capital of the world\", the location provides opportunities unrivaled by others.  By planning ahead, you can schedule classes with some top-notch professors who actively help students succeed and provide an unforgettable learning experience.  Though Core requirements are extensive, even excessive to some, they make way for an education that explores all fields.  The Jesuit presence is in no way overbearing and the community is open to a diversity of thought (Professors are almost always unrelated to the Church; even theology classes teach a variety of religions).  The Rose Hill campus is quite beautiful, boasting sports teams, a large library, and a variety of eateries.  Both campuses are very safe and any incidents are vigilantly pursued by campus safety and the NYPD. Fordham can be a very good experience, if deemed worth the price point (note they do award aid) and if one is willing to take advantage of their time there.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2018-06-05T17:39:23.039915Z","guid":"c7e106e7-e1c4-45d2-8987-d3382185aaa0","rating":4},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":3.66}],"photos":{"default":{"crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/58a16aa62394c04c88abf70482b6dfc699f8d219.jpg","MobileHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/2a5478c448466060f510b754b7a99112cf2dbc0c.jpg"},"licenseName":"UNLICENSED"},"mapbox_header":{"crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-73.889578,40.861183,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-73.889578,40.861183,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"UNLICENSED"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.4920049200492005,"count":1626},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Bronx, NY"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/fordham-university/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"02e8c17e-d644-4a0d-b426-f4c9b43067bd","badge":{"display":"Best Colleges for Accounting and Finance in America","ordinal":78,"total":652,"vanityURL":"best-colleges-for-accounting"},"content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"Temple University","type":"College","url":"temple-university"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.5219},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":21237},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"1010-1230"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Alum","body":"I loved Temple University!

They are all passionate, smart, experts in their fields, and although some styles of teaching may clash I have never felt afraid to go and ask a professor for help. The small class sizes definitely help the close atmosphere one can develop with professors. The number of extracurriculars you can apply yourself to are also amazing. There's a club for everything. And I will plug a little about the theater group the College Players as I am a part of that! We have the second oldest student-run college theater group in the USA, second only to Harvard. How cool is that! \nWhat could be improved is the cafeteria food.

In the \"Grease Pit\", on the opposite side of the high way lining campus, there are more fast-food restaurants than you could even count on all your fingers and toes. In addition to the campus life and eateries, Baylor is the only university also certified as a zoo. With the two live bears, Joy and Lady, the campus is lit up by their presence as true mascots.

Altogether, attending Rutgers University was one of the best decisions I’ve made and I’m excited to see how far they can help me excel in my future career path!","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2018-01-26T02:04:09.687035Z","guid":"67b512a7-4158-4b8e-9f30-af1b6f87b1e6","rating":5},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":3.66}],"photos":{"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-74.175294,40.741303,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-74.175294,40.741303,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.5170984455958547,"count":965},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Newark, NJ"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/rutgers-university---newark/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"ee7d2698-9fcb-4645-9c99-cbc2c88cb232","badge":{"display":"Best Colleges for Accounting and Finance in America","ordinal":90,"total":652,"vanityURL":"best-colleges-for-accounting"},"content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"Creighton University","type":"College","url":"creighton-university"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.7066},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":30353},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"1050-1280"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Sophomore","body":"I do enjoy Creighton University.  After visiting Simpson, Drake, and other private Midwest four year institutions I must say that Creighton's Campus just felt like home.  The professors are all supportive and with a small student to teacher ratio, I feel like an actual person in their classes and can build a relationship with the professors.  The food is excellent, Godfather's Pizza, Chinese, Latin American, Sushi, Burgers, and buffet styled mess halls are a good indication of the different food at Creighton.  The dorms are a little on the dated side, yet they have modern amenities.  The older buildings really gives the place a theme and a warm glow.  Everything is nice and compact seeing that this campus is in the middle of Omaha and all of my classes are within 10-15 minutes of one another.  The advisors are always courteous and listen to the students needs and wants.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2018-05-31T18:36:22.198929Z","guid":"7cb7e8b5-ca43-4732-8bc5-2aa9bae9ad48","rating":4},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":3.66}],"photos":{"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-95.947029,41.265325,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-95.947029,41.265325,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.591194968553459,"count":954},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Omaha, NE"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/creighton-university/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"b8b0b015-4c19-47e8-bc54-f704470b5d1e","badge":{"display":"Best Colleges for Accounting and Finance in America","ordinal":91,"total":652,"vanityURL":"best-colleges-for-accounting"},"content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":true,"isPremium":false,"name":"University of Oklahoma","type":"College","url":"university-of-oklahoma"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.7084},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":17966},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"1060-1345"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Sophomore","body":"Very big & beautiful school with something for everyone! A lot of opportunities for internships, leadership positions and involvement. A lot of research opportunities and very good professors as well, especially for a public university. Despite the perception, OU is a lot more than just football and greek life. However, I would recommend that after freshman year, you live somewhere within walking distance to campus, because the parking here is absolutely awful and you will absolutely regret commuting to campus and spending nearly 2 hours looking for a parking spot everyday, even with a parking pass that costs hundreds of dollars. Also Dale Hall is a ridiculous building and if you have a class there, get there early because trying to make your way through the crowds in that building can sometimes take a while. The parking situation & Dale Hall is the only thing preventing me from giving this great school 5 stars.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2017-11-06T00:20:34.290457Z","guid":"75f25a4a-6e57-4df8-b0a2-0b3897295b1c","rating":4},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":4}],"photos":{"default":{"crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/6a7d7e2d5c708a009e6b4857db0d69cf2efb39c4.jpg","MobileHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/eeb1688e862a426894b97137be0e4145307a7a24.jpg","Thumbnail":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/0dfb8859200ebd86bfb0acaf4b7740bcc6822455"},"licenseName":"UNLICENSED"},"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-97.445692,35.208152,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-97.445692,35.208152,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.7810136157337366,"count":2644},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Norman, OK"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/university-of-oklahoma/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"c3ea35a9-85d8-473b-a511-4f7d71c3b78e","badge":{"display":"Best Colleges for Accounting and Finance in America","ordinal":92,"total":652,"vanityURL":"best-colleges-for-accounting"},"content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":true,"isPremium":false,"name":"North Carolina State University","type":"College","url":"north-carolina-state-university"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.4751},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":13066},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"1170-1350"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Junior","body":"One thing that I love about North Carolina State University is the amount of diversity and school pride here on campus.

I think NCSU has one of the best engineering and communication programs here on campus and they also have a lot of resources at our libraries and everywhere else on campus. Their database is incredible and the library has so much information for you to refer to when doing research or completing an essay. This University has a strong reputation of academic success as well competitive students, which is makes our school very exciting.

Elon's curriculum can be very intense at times; however, I am getting an education based on the work that I put in. One complaint that I have about Elon is paying for laundry. The cost adds up very quickly and is often frustrating that I have to pay so that I am able to wear clean clothes to class.

The only issue I really had was parking, as it's hard to find spots sometimes.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2018-05-14T15:33:04.954659Z","guid":"485b7103-f16d-43ea-8ab7-0bc644346795","rating":4},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":4}],"photos":{"default":{"author":"xtrah","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/b9224fb93089ca7d42fae4223ef7577cdb407977.jpg","MobileHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/b8d4739f974f538905a82d00c68b34b716cecb55.jpg","Thumbnail":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/b03f3ed6319829479583c2e5672b93380a5c3787"},"licenseName":"CC BY ","licenseUrl":"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/2.0/","sourceUrl":"https://www.flickr.com/photos/xtrah/5737920776/"},"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-97.069743,36.123085,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-97.069743,36.123085,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.8173395102581074,"count":3022},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Stillwater, OK"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/oklahoma-state-university/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"3965dc39-4831-4f49-ada7-e37062524b3a","badge":{"display":"Best Colleges for Accounting and Finance in America","ordinal":97,"total":652,"vanityURL":"best-colleges-for-accounting"},"content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"John Carroll University","type":"College","url":"john-carroll-university"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.8299},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":27205},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"990-1200"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Junior","body":"John Carroll is an academically exceptional school. They have a rigorous core curriculum and the major requirements are equally challenging. It is technically a Catholic school, but the Catholic presence is hardly felt at times. It is politically left-leaning. The professors are incredibly personable and available to help their students. That is perhaps my favorite part about the university. There is truly no greater resource to college students than having professors who care about your academic career and success. There have been countless occasions where the help or advice of a professor has totally altered my performance in a class for the better. The students are all very respectful and hard-working. The facilities are actually quite nice, with the interiors of the buildings in excellent condition. The technology is above average.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2017-12-21T20:22:51.375182Z","guid":"41636f32-8e1f-4cff-90ae-548d2b0f4ce5","rating":4},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":3.66}],"photos":{"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-81.533103,41.488978,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-81.533103,41.488978,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.518421052631579,"count":760},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"University Heights, OH"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/john-carroll-university/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"dbd44661-bd7c-4bda-99aa-d85184537739","badge":{"display":"Best Colleges for Accounting and Finance in America","ordinal":98,"total":652,"vanityURL":"best-colleges-for-accounting"},"content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"University of Utah","type":"College","url":"university-of-utah"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.7642},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":11322},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"1050-1300"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Freshman","body":"I love my school! I’m a diversity student - part Samoan part Caucasian, gay, religious - and the way the university handles its diversity students is phenomnial! The organizations that I’ve benefitted the most from have been CESA (Center of Ethnic Students Association), specifically PISA (Polynesian Islanders Students Association) that is within CESA, and the school’s LGBT Resource Center. These two organizations - CESA and their LGBT Resource Center - have helped adjust to college life as a first year student. I feel right at home and I feel safe.\n\nMoreover, the faculty, at least in my experience, have always been supportive of diversity students and help accommodate them and their needs. I’ve many that talk openly and respectfully concerning lgbt issues, diversity issues, and they always end with their discussions inspiration and motivation to dream big and achieve our goals. \n\nIt’d be a dream if I could continue my education there.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2018-06-04T17:43:01.882008Z","guid":"1ffe6e36-cd4f-4fff-b11b-544c393955d0","rating":5},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":4}],"photos":{"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-111.846044,40.762484,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-111.846044,40.762484,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.7160945413618456,"count":3554},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Salt Lake City, UT"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/university-of-utah/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"f065fb88-c933-474f-abb3-98eb0421a583","badge":{"display":"Best Colleges for Accounting and Finance in America","ordinal":99,"total":652,"vanityURL":"best-colleges-for-accounting"},"content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"St. John's University - New York","type":"College","url":"st-johns-university---new-york"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.6336},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":26582},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"970-1180"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Junior","body":"Aside from its numerous Division 1 athletic teams and gorgeous campus attractions, SJU has an extensive umbrella of support systems and student life opportunities for its Johnnies.
