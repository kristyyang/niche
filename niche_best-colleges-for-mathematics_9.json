There's free tutoring if needed\nUNH works with most study abroad programs. It's discovery credit system makes it easy for credits to transfer towards your major. \nFor food It's in the top 1% of USA. There's 3 dining halls as well as shops all around campus.

With class sizes of about 16-17 students it's hard to hide in the corner or skip class without your professor noticing. Trust me, this is a good thing.

I chose this school for its reputation in nursing.  In addition to its great reputation, the food is great(lots of options too), bathrooms are clean, showers/sinks arent crowded, people are generally approachable and pleasant(although i can sniff the fakeness of some from a mile away), and the campus/city is very attractive and admirable. My professors are also pretty nice and very qualified.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2016-08-22T23:32:51Z","guid":"7725cd22-b3d9-4619-a757-6debe11ec4b6","rating":4},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":3.66}],"photos":{"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-79.993046,40.437496,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-79.993046,40.437496,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.466616654163541,"count":1333},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Pittsburgh, PA"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/duquesne-university/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"bfd9cd81-afba-461f-b8c2-d80d33130493","content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"St. Mary's University - Texas","type":"College","url":"st-marys-university---texas"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.7766},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":16857},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"950-1130"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Junior","body":"St. Mary's University delivers a diverse, loving, small-town atmosphere.

North Dakota State University focus on the needs of the students and do whatever they can to satisfy their needs.

The professors make class interesting and are really good at keeping the students engaged.
