The bluffs are beautiful and the nearby Lake allows the community to kayak and more for a small yearly fee.  The campus is really pretty and has been updated in a lot of ways--there is a caribou coffee and snack shop in the library (the library is beautiful, spacious, and bright btw!), they have added another newer coffee shop in Somsen Hall as well.  Yes like all colleges there are a lot of old buildings, but they have charm and history.  The Wellness Center is amazing--relatively updated and very modern looking.    The food court has also been remodeled and looks great as well.  Overall, I had a great time at the school--true, the city of Winona is a little bland, there is the typical movie theater and a couple restaurants that aren't chains, but its a small town.  Typically, people can travel to La Crosse or Rochester for the nearest mall or other adventures.  Honestly though, Winona State is beautiful and a pretty great school.

Although the tuition is high, their financial aid packages cover a lot of the costs. The campus is tiny, but it is nice. Some people have noisy neighbors in the dorms, as I did. They would scream karaoke at 3 am. Our school has \"quiet hours\" set in place, but they didn't always listen. The dorms have no air conditioning so my dorm was always hot. This could just be Assumption Hall. The food is always hit or miss. The Cafe sometimes tries to make fancy meals, but they come out bland. Other times they offer hand rolled sushi and it is delicious. The food is definitely overpriced as well. Lastly, the teachers. Some teacher loves what they're doing and love to work with you until you understand what you are doing. Other teacher don't understand how to convey concepts to students in a manner that is understandable.

North Park is located near the home of the Chicago Cubs!  It was an awesome feeling to be part of the World Series 2016!  I am only a sophomore at North Park, and I hope I am given the opportunity to graduate from here.  The tuition is very expensive for me, but I'm trying my best to get really good grades and apply for available scholarships.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2017-02-03T01:22:23.039851Z","guid":"91d8730a-4e15-432d-a05f-ae559df227f5","rating":5},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":3}],"photos":{"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-87.709142,41.9751,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-87.709142,41.9751,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.5990338164251208,"count":621},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Chicago, IL"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/north-park-university/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"a33d388d-1d11-4735-98ba-c60ffb44788c","content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"Augsburg College","type":"College","url":"augsburg-college"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.4514},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":24394},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"910-1200"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Freshman","body":"Overall as a first year student I've enjoyed the classes, the diversity in this school is amazing, everyone is really kind, and the professors are great.

With that said, it is one of the most difficult programs. You must have incredible passion and motivation to be successful in nursing. Widener's atmosphere is supportive and light-hearted. Everyone here supports each other. Widener also offers an immense list of clubs and activities, including a student nurse association, student government, student life, etc. There is always something to do here. The nursing staff is also incredible. Every single professor is here to aid you in your studies. I have not had a bad experience with any nursing professor, and some have even become friends.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2018-04-25T18:30:55.347783Z","guid":"49fdb668-8001-4db7-9dcd-086b1319ba80","rating":4},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":2.66}],"photos":{"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-75.356718,39.86158,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-75.356718,39.86158,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.4615384615384617,"count":663},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Chester, PA"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/widener-university/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"f68d0c9a-04e0-4608-984b-dc7853fb9572","content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"Emmanuel College - Massachusetts","type":"College","url":"emmanuel-college---massachusetts"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.714},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":31891},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"1030-1200"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Freshman","body":"As an incoming freshmen, it isn’t always a bit nerve wracking to know that I will be on campus in less than 6 months.
