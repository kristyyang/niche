Wheaton is sometimes called Whiteon for a reason. It is super white, super white evangelical, and that's what needs to change: diversity of race, ethnicity, and opinion needs to be valued from the TOP down. There's a good group of people striving for this, for Wheaton to be a welcoming home for all students, staff, and faculty, and for non-white/Western views to be taught in academics, etc, but that's not the reality yet.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2017-12-30T19:57:06.303423Z","guid":"d45345f3-a8f1-48ae-9d13-b9bcb390b355","rating":4},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":4}],"photos":{"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-88.09681,41.870943,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-88.09681,41.870943,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.884228187919463,"count":596},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Wheaton, IL"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/wheaton-college---illinois/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"ddeb909d-02c4-484c-87a4-31a9d02355e6","content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"Fairleigh Dickinson University","type":"College","url":"fairleigh-dickinson-university"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.7683},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":18016},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"870-1070"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Freshman","body":"As a second-semester freshman, awaiting to embark my sophomore year of college, this school is great...for me.

The staff and administration work tirelessly to ensure the wellbeing of all their students academically, professionally and even emotionally. The curriculum and field based experiences are all set to better aid students in beginning, continuing, or changing their career.

Professors are very thorough with lectures, learning material, and what is expected. Study groups are a plus! With the awesome interaction between peers and countless ways of communication, study groups are highly encouraged at ASU, and proven effective! Also, there are many tutoring sessions. There is no reason students should fail. Parties are awesome and anything to imagine! Campus life is amazing; however, some greek organizations are not on the yard.

I appreciate Luther's diversity, with a large international student population, but I often find myself wishing there was more diversity in experience and opinion in my classes. \nWorking with the housing system at Luther was not always the easiest or best experience when trying to manage toxic rooming situations, and think the housing application should be updated, and procedures changed to give students more flexibility.\nOverall, I have had a good experience at Luther, and hope that it will only improve in the years to come.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2018-03-24T19:47:15.968459Z","guid":"0d909646-455d-4fc2-bf14-56e9e4723de3","rating":4},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":4}],"photos":{"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-91.803971,43.313584,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-91.803971,43.313584,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.6958456973293767,"count":674},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Decorah, IA"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/luther-college/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"a177260a-7e56-4b41-b5da-1e9b213209f4","content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"Xavier University of Louisiana","type":"College","url":"xavier-university-of-louisiana"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.6195},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":17430},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"890-1110"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Sophomore","body":"I enjoyed the overall experience that Xavier University of Louisiana brought.

The professors are very responsive to student requests for assistance and will work with you on any issues you may have. There are free tutors in all subjects available on campus so that students can receive extra help where it is needed. There is a family feel to this school that is inclusive and supportive. JU is located close to the Atlantic Ocean, so students have plenty of fun weekend activities in a nearby getaway locale. I am participating in the Aviation program, which is top-notch. I will graduate with a four-year degree that will have me completely prepared for a career as an airline pilot.  At the opening-of-school ceremony, all of the incoming freshmen carried candles signifying we should strive to be a \"light in the world.\" I believe I am studying among students who are focusing on their studies, trying to do their best in school, and wanting to make a difference in the world beyond college.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2018-02-18T04:46:58.533499Z","guid":"bdb45ee1-9862-4583-bd09-7863e580406f","rating":5},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":3}],"photos":{"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-81.60706,30.350349,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-81.60706,30.350349,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.6066066066066065,"count":666},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Jacksonville, FL"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/jacksonville-university/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"ba584809-7c16-45c5-8d4d-bbb61c31cea3","content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"University of Mount Union","type":"College","url":"university-of-mount-union"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.7699},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":22728},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"890-1110"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Freshman","body":"I love Mount Union because the atmosphere is very friendly. I think many people assume because Mount is an expensive college, the students will be stuck up snobs. This is completely untrue. I have found the complete opposite to be true really. I come from a low income household and paid for college completely through scholarships and grants. Never once have I felt lesser because of my socioeconomic status. Everyone I've interacted with have been exceptionally kind to one another. As funny as it is to say, the one thing that sticks out in my mind is the extreme lengths students go to to hold doors for others. The professors are always available and are able to relate well with students. Course material is difficult, but the atmosphere is full of resources and encouragement.
