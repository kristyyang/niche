This life is not desirable to everyone as cadets are taught to march, wear uniforms, disassemble rifles, and properly prepare for uniform inspections. Many of the operations that take place on campus are cadet run and supervised  by Cadet rank holders.  Responsibility is delegated through cadet officers, and NCOs and most importantly students are given a firm education in leadership.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2017-05-14T02:58:17.440418Z","guid":"bbbe7033-6145-4010-9f9a-532be86e693e","rating":4},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":3.33}],"photos":{"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-79.961399,32.796975,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-79.961399,32.796975,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.659217877094972,"count":358},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Charleston, SC"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/citadel-military-college-of-south-carolina/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"398cbd66-59da-4cd2-af3b-7b65d2dd5f9c","content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"University of Arkansas at Pine Bluff","type":"College","url":"university-of-arkansas-at-pine-bluff"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.4193},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":7840},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"838-1065"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Sophomore","body":"I'm a sophomore here at the great University of Arkansas at Pine Bluff!

Juggling classes, multiple jobs, and multiple extracurriculars can be difficult - but this is a high intensity school in a high intensity city.\nI love women's college though!

Florida Southern is a wonderful institution with a lot of educational opportunities and extracurricular activities for students. I loved my undergrad and graduate experience. I took advantage of getting involved in a sorority, community service, and I was a member of the chorale. I also participated in three internships and studied abroad. Lakeland is great too! It is a tight knit suburban community with a lot to offer college students. There are a lot of really great restaurants and I love the Lakeside Village. Florida Southern changed my life for the best!
