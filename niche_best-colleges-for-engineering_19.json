People tend to shrug off private colleges because of the cost, but they really work with you on tuition.

I think the food and the safety at RMC could be improved with better guidance and feedback from students.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2018-02-23T18:03:39.359428Z","guid":"4a5c673c-6d4f-411c-b83a-badd3da2cd47","rating":4},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":2.66}],"photos":{"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-77.472253,37.749654,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-77.472253,37.749654,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.5089285714285716,"count":448},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Ashland, VA"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/randolph-macon-college/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"512cda37-4f86-4dca-be88-1ba7b7f6b439","content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"Rockhurst University","type":"College","url":"rockhurst-university"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.7406},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":23753},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"986-1166"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Niche User","body":"I'm the parent of a Rockhurst sophomore and feel like the university has been an excellent choice for my daughter, and she agrees. Its a close knit school and very friendly csmpus. Academics are very good with small class sizes.  My daughter, who is African American, has made friends of all sorts and is involved in a lot. Sure, it does not have the big school sports scene but the college was top ranked in division two in severals sports. Security seems tight so far and there's a real emphasis on community service. If you want a school where the student will not get lost in a crowd and will get a very good foundation, Rockhurst is an under the radar gem with well respected academics as with most Jesuit colleges. Its not a commuter school even though its in an urban area. Campus is beautiful and not urban looking at all.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2017-08-26T05:03:14.500932Z","guid":"d2dcfbca-2735-4506-a1cb-af03240d0215","rating":5},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":3.66}],"photos":{"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-94.571249,39.030843,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-94.571249,39.030843,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.589080459770115,"count":348},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Kansas City, MO"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/rockhurst-university/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"6a85aad2-b511-4c2e-bce1-cf55f28d00ef","content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":true,"isPremium":false,"name":"University of Pittsburgh - Bradford","type":"College","url":"university-of-pittsburgh---bradford"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.526},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":17018},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"870-1090"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Freshman","body":"Coming from a big city, I didn't expect to like Pitt-Bradford as much as I do.

While on campus, many of the staff members will get to know you by name, not as a number. To me, it is really important to recognize students and call them by name, as it makes you feel important. There is always a Campus Safety Guard around for emergencies, and they are very quick responders.

The campus have a lot of geeks and nerds that is into computers, video games, and anime. \n\nFinally, the financial aid office will help anyway they can to help your tuition and make sure you can come to Capitol.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2016-12-14T18:54:11.33008Z","guid":"43421a80-d634-40dd-87cc-599199c9621f","rating":4},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":2.33}],"photos":{"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-76.851413,39.047047,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-76.851413,39.047047,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.34375,"count":128},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Laurel, MD"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/capitol-technology-university/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"a675daa2-cad2-4c18-b7e7-351cf4a57e40","content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":true,"isPremium":false,"name":"Webb Institute","type":"College","url":"webb-institute"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.2931},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":18928},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"1410-1490"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Junior","body":"Webb Institute is a great place to build character and push to improve yourself academically. The food service was recently improved and is now fantastic and accommodating for those with allergies. The small school atmosphere is magnified at Webb with only 92 current students. The athletics are weak, but the academics are strong and always looking to improve. The return on investment is without a doubt the best part of Webb. A few benefits are the 100% job placement, set-up internships, and a family of connections throughout the marine industry! The opportunities are incredible, so the toughness of the academics is completely worth it! Overall a great school!","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2018-01-13T08:10:14.7075Z","guid":"3f20811e-91b1-48a3-922c-3b3747615e43","rating":4},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade"}],"photos":{"default":{"crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/ace9b79a2f1255260ae332d571cd2d91ee0091a2.jpg","MobileHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/b5885da6c37f4438fea2ccb0e55c346f1cd8cc55.jpg"},"licenseName":"UNLICENSED"},"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-73.644838,40.884352,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-73.644838,40.884352,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":4.25,"count":60},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Glen Cove, NY"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/webb-institute/#scatterplot"}}]}
