Located in Palos Heights, it a nice quiet location for those who desire to be away from the bustling and noise from the city. I have found a sense of peace and enjoyment by its location alone! The staff and professors are helpful and offer students both good advice as well as certain student resources that can be utilized at anytime. The only thing that is keeping me from giving this a 5-star rating is that the food quality. It is not terrible, rather it is acceptable but there is room for improvement. That aside, should anyone wish to start off their college studies on campus, I would recommend this college for them.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2017-12-30T20:44:54.679473Z","guid":"18164ad5-ac6d-4519-81f6-129bac89fa55","rating":4},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":3}],"photos":{"default":{"crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/b242f07f266b32061aad10d950e4f29c868e64b0.jpg","MobileHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/04f549455efc19bf0effacff92a17f7327850511.jpg"},"licenseName":"UNLICENSED"},"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-87.784157,41.669189,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-87.784157,41.669189,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.5652173913043477,"count":276},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Palos Heights, IL"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/trinity-christian-college/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"bae200b9-b043-4367-a234-35b37896b6d6","content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"William Jessup University","type":"College","url":"william-jessup-university"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.7251},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":22263},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"900-1140"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Junior","body":"Jessup is absolutely wonderful!

The school over all was a great school but I feel like the resources that were available especially in the science department, that's where the majority of my time was spent, need to be upgraded tremendously. The school is really trying to satisfy the needs of the incoming students and I appreciate that fact. I met some of my closest friends at AB and it will always hold a special place in my heart.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2017-08-15T15:00:55.199331Z","guid":"66f9b7f5-3f6b-4442-8b85-e8d2274b2996","rating":4},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":2.33}],"photos":{"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-80.047728,39.158067,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-80.047728,39.158067,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.5597014925373136,"count":268},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Philippi, WV"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/alderson-broaddus-college/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"e0870765-4af3-4a76-8155-17fc1ac595e7","content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"McMurry University","type":"College","url":"mcmurry-university"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.4804},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":21516},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"820-1030"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Alum","body":"Coming from a big city, McMurry was the perfect college town for me!

The staff is well trained, and majority of teachers are willing to meet with students to explain how they can do better in classes. The school also has weekly events for the students that are provident by SGA. These events are well liked by the students they provide a variety of events like BINGO and making pillows. As far as food goes on campus, the cafeteria has a selection of different food items like pizza, subs, etc. The campus also has two Starbucks which have the majority of the same items as a full sized shop.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2018-05-27T17:30:46.968662Z","guid":"47c98d73-1e45-4d65-8be2-934d933f85bb","rating":5},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":2}],"photos":{"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-83.887982,36.869066,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-83.887982,36.869066,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.452830188679245,"count":106},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Barbourville, KY"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/union-college---kentucky/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"ee1bdb42-3d51-4a59-b746-20a192fc3679","content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"LeMoyne-Owen College","type":"College","url":"lemoyne-owen-college"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":1},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":8587},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"640-820"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Senior","body":"I am overjoyed about my experience at LOC .

To be such a new and advancing University, the housing is literally an apartment complex. Also, there are so many options for people to do. There are so many opportunities for working, volunteering, traveling, and simply being involved. The LEAP crew hosts free programs like going to Lions games or Cedar Point. Also stuff like glow parties. I still have my TShirt from my freshman year of 2012. The RAs are very attentive. Jets has the greatest enployees and they help the students. There is always something going on in the Den. There is also an open door policy. If there is a door open, walk into it and say Hello!. I also love the FYE course. It encourages freshmen students to get involved with the school and to attened different events. They even take you camping for orientation which was 4 days of awesome.

If you're wondering just how close of a relationship you make with the staff at Averett - my advisor has a picture of us hanging in her office from my senior pinning, and when going through a hard time in a leadership role, the president wrote me an encouraging handwritten letter.

They won’t pursue you, you need to pursue them periodically in person to see if anything is amiss.
