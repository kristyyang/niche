I am very pleased with the quality of my education and the professors. I am enrolled in the Occupational Therapy BS/MS program and I have learned so much in the past 2 years. However, with the new president, there have been a lot of misplaced concern on what needs to be improved. The professors have been teaching without a contract for months which should be our administrations first priority. After that, the parking situation for this college made up of a majority of commuters should be addressed and the improving our existing buildings and facilities. New fields, gyms (for a D3 school), and other unnecessary expenses should be halted and priorities should be checked.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2018-05-29T19:51:14.696528Z","guid":"9a46a6aa-05d8-486a-8b23-58ef5b15707f","rating":4},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":2.66}],"photos":{"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-78.890369,42.902263,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-78.890369,42.902263,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.3380281690140845,"count":355},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Buffalo, NY"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/dyouville-college/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"29847b65-b92f-4a67-84af-078741efc935","content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"University of Montana","type":"College","url":"university-of-montana"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.9243},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":13894},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"950-1200"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Sophomore","body":"The main reason I love going to school here is simply the location and all of the outdoor activities around.

The buildings look great and the mostly glass designs give off an open, chic vibe. Webb University Center, or the Webb as we call it, has 5+ eateries, a video game lobby, pool tables, and it is home to many student activities. Unlike other schools, Old Dominion allows their freshman to enjoy their college experience. We have only 1-2 visitation rules, residents don't have a curfew, and dorms are co-ed. With all this freedom, the university still makes sure our work gets done. We are given free tutoring, study rooms on every floor of every dorm, and many educational centers. To relax from the stress of school, you could party near or on campus! Safe Ride (ODU's free transportation.) will take you anywhere that isn't beyond 38th street, which most parties aren't. As you can see ODU allows you to work hard and play hard too so come join us and become a monarch!","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2018-03-08T19:29:36.308387Z","guid":"0de9741a-c19c-412d-b0e9-84030928c78c","rating":5},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":3}],"photos":{"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-76.309653,36.884919,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-76.309653,36.884919,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.5399794976934906,"count":3902},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Norfolk, VA"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/old-dominion-university/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"ed38093b-32e0-4fc3-b01f-8490d67ecd3f","content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"Saint Peter's University","type":"College","url":"saint-peters-university"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.7425},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":14734},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"830-1030"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"College Junior","body":"Saint Peter's is a small campus so it is likely you come across the same people daily. It is in an urban area with a diverse community so I enjoy the atmosphere when I attend classes throughout the day. From experience, I can say the professors and staff are readily available for students during a time of need, whether it is academic or personal. College is what you make it and I am fortunate enough to surround myself with friends who make it such an amazing experience. Being a nursing major, I have a pile of workload so I spend a lot of my time at the library, which is an exceptional place to study in without any distraction. SPU clubs also try to get the students into the school spirit and I can say that there are some fun events that can be attended throughout the school year.

It's not perfect, but no college is. However, being a freshman, my transition from high school to college has been great. Most professors are super helpful and really like to challenge you. Campus safety is a goal that Rhode Island College strives to make their students feel. There is always RIC security driving through campus and many emergency push buttons all over. Which makes you feel very safe. The campus is small and beautiful and gives a home feeling like no other college I looked into. I am a commuter so I can not say what it is like living on campus. However the one downfall the college has is not enough parking spaces...Like ever. The school is mostly a commuter school which is cool, but parking can be horrendous depending on the time you have classes.

The professors are more than willing to sit down with you and break it down, piece by piece. You are not just another nameless face, you are you. Being a liberal arts college, distributions are a requirement. Though they may be an annoyance at first, they become well-rounded student shaping machines. Through these classes, you are able to educate your self of the other perceptions, cultures, and ideas along with the synthesis of your own.

Western makes sure you can get the full experience and still learn.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2018-05-31T23:22:56.49844Z","guid":"3b5da4f7-ee68-4b64-98a7-66e6c3022d88","rating":5},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":3.33}],"photos":{"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-85.61512,42.282589,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-85.61512,42.282589,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.675547098001903,"count":3153},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Kalamazoo, MI"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/western-michigan-university/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"d9af4a17-36e6-4039-8b42-83022cf18eb0","content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"Bluffton University","type":"College","url":"bluffton-university"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.4953},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":25101},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"840-1140"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Niche User","body":"When I visited Bluffton University I absolutely loved the campus.

Cannot beat the small class sizes and professor attention. Coming from Rutgers university i really appreciate that. Not as cutthroat as rutgers or other schools. I also actually like that each professor takes attendance and counts it as ten percent or more, of your grade. This encourages class attendance and pushes their students to do well. It is very possible to get a 4.0 if you show up to class and put in the effort, which for some classes requires less work than others.  I gave 4/5 because of the parking situation although they are trying to improve this situation by adding across the street parking. Parking is available but you may need to walk a bit or take the shuttle from other parts of campus. I also received 150$ cougar dollars because i was taking a saturday course which is awesome and very helpful for a broke college students!","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2017-10-08T21:38:46.586276Z","guid":"d6dc4cb1-4607-4bec-83c2-53169838cc8f","rating":4},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":2.66}],"photos":{"default":{"crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/859a4d9d0796621f891ab53ccda6c6fd903ed3a4.jpg","MobileHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/f07fa8da1eafb01ef2100eaac2340260ff021fcc.jpg"},"licenseName":"UNLICENSED"},"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-74.234668,40.679429,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-74.234668,40.679429,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.5614320585842147,"count":1229},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Union, NJ"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/kean-university/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"8fb82592-8c2c-43f3-a7eb-29958d1320ed","content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"Lenoir-Rhyne University","type":"College","url":"lenoir-rhyne-university"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.7011},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":18291},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"870-1090"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Freshman","body":"I love the small classroom sizes and the one on one help that you are able to receive from the professors.

The student life is great. The students and professors are working to help everyone strive to be better. The classes are long but they pay off at the end. Tuition is cheaper than most universities. The campus is beautiful in the winter and summer. It feels like home if your coming from out of state. Madonna is a catholic University but they do not influence your religion. Their goal is to help you become the better you! They provide easy services for any need you may have. They honestly prepare you for your career and when you graduate, you will see all your had work has finally paid off.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2018-01-02T16:10:04.322223Z","guid":"693b9a68-13bd-4f43-a229-4218dbd0d004","rating":5},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":3.66}],"photos":{"default":{"crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/d82e4547c10c28e03f6d181b4c9590482b4c20f2.jpg","MobileHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/e3f4291625022cdbc1d6da13e8aad77d1faa711d.jpg"},"licenseName":"UNLICENSED"},"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-83.407306,42.386463,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-83.407306,42.386463,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.6496674057649665,"count":451},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Livonia, MI"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/madonna-university/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"b21a90df-109d-4ced-ae82-7df91c120f2f","content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"University of West Florida","type":"College","url":"university-of-west-florida"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.4083},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":11175},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"950-1130"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Senior","body":"In my humble opinion based upon my experience, the University of West Florida may not be the best school to attend, but it is one of the best schools to attend within the state of Florida that provides enough of a return on your investment to count. Class sizes are normally small enough that professors can talk to and interact with students on a one-on-one basis to answer questions, to provide assistance, to facilitate conversation, and to even assist with opportunities. With more than seventy individual majors and the opportunities to earn multiple majors, students definitely have not only variety but choice to maximize the opportunities afforded to them to achieve their dreams. The Office of Undergraduate Research has been instrumental in allowing students to travel, to present research, and network, and students are often more than prepared to attend graduate schools and to fill the vacant job and/or leadership positions available after college.
