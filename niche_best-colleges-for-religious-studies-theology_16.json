Thanks to the friendly teachers, staff and peers, I find myself much more confident and sociable. The campus scene is beautiful all year round. I am the only Vietnamese kid on campus, so sometimes I can feel small and lonely, but no, in Cornell College, I have sources to reach whenever I need. If you are bored after a long day of classes, the best thing to do is to sit on the grass and relax. Cornell College campus scene is beautiful all year round, spring, summer, fall, winter, I never get sick of it. \nThe food is diverse, much much better than it used to be around 4-5 years ago. Now everyone can enjoy new variety of food everyday, including Asian, Latin, European food. \nMy friends on campus are friendly with LGBT, black and international, so the atmosphere makes everybody feel comfortable. I am very glad that Cornell chose me.

I also enjoy that classes are not to spread apart so you do not have to get a certain parking spot or try to fight for a parking spot because most classes are walking-distance. The professors always offer a one-on-one, and it is easy to get help. The only disadvantage is the price. It is pretty pricey, so that is why I am not in their meal-plan nor a resident.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2018-06-08T16:13:03.494108Z","guid":"bb69e618-fd32-4aa0-a088-8c2a00640ad6","rating":4},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":2}],"photos":{"default":{"crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/30faea2ad04b73f86a8ff432afec0d813a2e3be0.jpg","MobileHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/6a555ea4f7bc4fbadf165cda0d86e531f1bf3005.jpg"},"licenseName":"UNLICENSED"},"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-83.745972,34.594437,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-83.745972,34.594437,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":4,"count":146},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Cleveland, GA"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/truett-mcconnell-university/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"a9a54174-fb87-4bfa-a7b6-7cebcaa9ecc2","content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"Spartanburg Methodist College","type":"College","url":"spartanburg-methodist-college"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.6519},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":13713},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"760-950"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"College Junior","body":"Like I've said, I love my first semester's professors. They were all pretty friendly and helpful. All but the computer professor (of course) have a strong objection to electronics in the classroom, though, which I thought was a bit odd. I understand prohibiting cell phones in class. I do not understand prohibiting tablets or laptops, even if you're using them to take notes. Luckily I have accommodations to take notes electronically--otherwise, I'd be up a certain creek without a paddle. Most high schools use iPads or some other tablet/laptop now, in the classroom, so students coming in are obviously used to that; why prohibit it now? Anyway, the courses I took were great. Their quality was more or less impeccable. Class sizes are GREAT--usually 20-30. As to variety...their catalog says that French and German classes are available, but they're actually not, because they don't have anyone to teach them; as a result, the only available foreign language course is Spanish. I am tired of Spanish being the only language both offered and/or required in all schools, not just college. It's time to break out into other linguistic areas!","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2015-12-29T17:25:23Z","guid":"c3f4f03d-933f-41be-848b-589b4fb4ae81","rating":5},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":2.66}],"photos":{"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-81.970898,34.954585,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-81.970898,34.954585,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.5481927710843375,"count":166},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"2 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Spartanburg, SC"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/spartanburg-methodist-college/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"f2151c29-a710-4ab6-8f76-50678b0952b5","content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"Hannibal-LaGrange University","type":"College","url":"hannibal-lagrange-university"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.6164},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":19086},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"850-1140"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Sophomore","body":"Hannibal-LaGrange University has been a very good experience.

There is a reasonable variety in the credentials of the professors that makes the student aware of differing views within  evangelical theology and the Christian worldview. The environment is one of the best things in the school. There is a friendliness about almost everyone and a strong sense of community. You will eventually feel like you belong there!

It is a smaller college, but that is not synonymous with being a lesser college. We are a close knit family and everyone around campus (be it student, faculty, or staff) knows each other appreciates each other. Being a small campus allows Holy Cross to achieve an experience that even Notre Dame does not have. The students and Professors are able to develop a relationship with each other. People are known by name at Holy Cross and they are remembered. As a student there, I have grown to know so many unique individuals beyond my class mates or Professors. This is the point the Holy Cross drives at and hits home own. We are not just a college at Holy Cross, we are a close knit diverse family all striving to help each other.

Joining a group is a good way to make new friends, make memories, compete in sports against other social groups, and a good way to get community service hours.
