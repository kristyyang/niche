When our tour guides say that SU has a wonderful community, they're telling the truth! You will get to know your professors, and will likely work closely with multiple professors. The school offers a wide variety of jobs to students, especially those receiving work study. Unfortunately, like all colleges, there are issues with the administration, in that they sometimes have a misguided view of what the student body wants or needs. However, a wonderful pro of this is that this brings the students closer together.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2017-05-24T12:30:03.183186Z","guid":"a55cab85-a0c9-42bc-a5a3-b1cffc39bfa9","rating":4},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":3.33}],"photos":{"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-76.87521,40.79774,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-76.87521,40.79774,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.4993197278911565,"count":735},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Selinsgrove, PA"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/susquehanna-university/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"ada7d3b1-b9c5-41cd-ad95-bddb87711e19","badge":{"display":"Best Colleges for Communications in America","ordinal":293,"total":714,"vanityURL":"best-colleges-for-communications"},"content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"Oregon State University","type":"College","url":"oregon-state-university"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.7748},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":19484},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"990-1240"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Niche User","body":"The Public Health and Human Services department at Oregon State University was wonderful.

My professors first semester were all so helpful and invested in truly helping their students succeed. Their office hours were always super open to students, and they were some of the friendliest people I have met. Although the school is originally very expensive, they offer many scholarships and loans through financial aid that make attending the university infinitely more affordable. Classes were neither too  easy nor too difficult. They were just enough work to challenge me, but not overwhelm me. If I had any complaints about Hamline, they would fall into the residential life category. My dorm is very old and in need of some renovation. The toilets and showers are always broken, and the elevator does not always work. The size of my room is perfect, though. Unfortunately I will not be living on campus next year due to the old living facilities, though.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2018-01-23T19:14:32.5679Z","guid":"eed8b157-d70e-467c-bcf8-28010360c261","rating":4},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":3}],"photos":{"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-93.163983,44.965696,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-93.163983,44.965696,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.426892950391645,"count":766},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Saint Paul, MN"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/hamline-university/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"245d037c-95fa-4a57-8c8c-c061cf791e92","badge":{"display":"Best Colleges for Communications in America","ordinal":297,"total":714,"vanityURL":"best-colleges-for-communications"},"content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"Georgia Southern University","type":"College","url":"georgia-southern-university"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.6455},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":16121},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"1030-1190"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Junior","body":"Georgia Southern is a great school!

For example, the student center has over four different restaurants and the workers are nice. The staff occupying these places such as the recreation center, bookstore, and admissions office are welcoming, helpful, and friendly.

Professors care and work with you.  Many repeatedly encourage students to visit offices.  Very open. Running trail by cornfields,  wetlands to explore, two lakes, a cemetery, woods, and school is only 2-10 minutes from Walmart/The Mall/etc (Many job opps aside from work study).  Mass held in the basilica on Sunday. Professors are also VERY FRIENDLY monks that live on campus.  Don't feel pressured if not religious, no requirements.\n\nMiscellaneous:\nAthletics huge here.

I am in the Arts and Sciences program which is still good, but the Law and Business programs definitely get the most attention.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2018-02-28T17:52:45.604285Z","guid":"ebca824f-6354-4e4c-a61e-41f8b5bd4f83","rating":4},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":3}],"photos":{"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-71.061969,42.359088,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-71.061969,42.359088,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.3966666666666665,"count":900},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Boston, MA"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/suffolk-university/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"50d681e4-99d3-4429-897b-b421d8de8aeb","badge":{"display":"Best Colleges for Communications in America","ordinal":316,"total":714,"vanityURL":"best-colleges-for-communications"},"content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":true,"isPremium":true,"name":"Centenary College of Louisiana","type":"College","url":"centenary-college-of-louisiana"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.6422},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":23607},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"940-1170"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Alum","body":"I absolutely loved my time here at Centenary College!

Overall, I was very nervous to move from my small town, but once I got settled in, I was very happy with the decision I made. I have grown so much as a person being independent. The thing that I have found frustrating is that some student advisors are not helpful at all and haven't necessarily steered me in the right direction. I have often found myself having to stress over registering for class, having transfer credits be put into the schools system. Other than that, I have really enjoyed my time in Duluth and have no intentions of transferring.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2018-04-11T04:14:33.452193Z","guid":"f121b6d4-0275-4c75-869a-b5b81daa5019","rating":4},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":3.33}],"photos":{"default":{"crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/1e562a903f6491646584ae64c62ffcdeb6369c36.jpg","MobileHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/a6b0bb6911c55497268733970b537b4a54edb4e2.jpg"},"licenseName":"UNLICENSED"},"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-92.0866,46.817,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-92.0866,46.817,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.5698602794411176,"count":1002},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Duluth, MN"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/university-of-minnesota-duluth/#scatterplot"}}]}
