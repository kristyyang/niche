They take time to get to know you. My advisor is awesome too. The food is good when you come to visit...but not too great when you get here. There is a shuttle to walmart...be sure to have a microwave and have snack foods in your room. Canton is really small.

My best advice for those that are thinking about coming here is that if you thrive in a chill and relaxed environment, then this is a great place for you! The campus is dead most of the times, so if you are looking for a party school do not come here.  Overall I think the university is great for on campus activities, the knowledgable professors and the small classroom sizes.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2018-05-19T18:57:31.166016Z","guid":"ce0e148d-3991-4838-96a5-c765e70a87c3","rating":4},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":2.66}],"photos":{"default":{"crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/3d4e203434169bc3a3125077b2be973409504bc0.jpg","MobileHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/badf7c1f0fb7e98ffbc11258dc12d2d67564face.jpg"},"licenseName":"UNLICENSED"},"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-155.081329,19.701854,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-155.081329,19.701854,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.2812121212121212,"count":825},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Hilo, HI"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/university-of-hawaii-at-hilo/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"2bbaaab0-e6bb-4b98-b5de-a768c4de5af2","content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"Brigham Young University - Hawaii","type":"College","url":"brigham-young-university---hawaii"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.2708},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":12319},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"973-1158"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Freshman","body":"Byu Hawaii is a dream come true.\nI love! It is a safe, honest, happy university that really cares about your success.

The campus is gorgeous with first class facilities, all the coaches that I've met are great as well as the professors and the all around feeling I get when I'm on campus is amazing. The students there have been super helpful to me with any questions I've had so far and seem like great people that I can't wait to be around for the next four years. All in all Dallas Baptist University is a lovely place with a great campus and even better people and I'm super excited I picked them to be the place I spend the next four years at.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2018-04-13T14:55:12.076839Z","guid":"20528f82-cd79-4039-86d2-c517872257b0","rating":5},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":3.33}],"photos":{"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-96.947006,32.710017,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-96.947006,32.710017,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.911664779161948,"count":883},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Dallas, TX"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/dallas-baptist-university/#scatterplot"}}]}
