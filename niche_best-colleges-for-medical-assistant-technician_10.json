As an individual trying to obtain their second degree I find this school to be the perfect fit. It is small and close knit environment. Each of the staff members are friendly, reliable, and knowledgable. If they don't know the answer to something they do not hesitate to inform you of that, but will do everything in their power to help you obtain that answer. The instructors work very hard to help you achieve success. You will work hard, no matter what program you are in, but I can guarantee you, you will feel more than prepared in your field.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2017-07-21T02:54:32.399929Z","guid":"4f24d923-9b6b-4fa1-bcb3-1c64f9c586ee","rating":5},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade"}],"photos":{"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-80.838535,35.200295,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-80.838535,35.200295,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":4.407407407407407,"count":27},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"2 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Charlotte, NC"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/carolinas-college-of-health-sciences/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"0331808a-dba3-4a35-8e8c-50b0f3f2e986","content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"Charles R.
