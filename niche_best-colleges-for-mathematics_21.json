First off, the atmosphere at the University of North Alabama is unlike any other! Seeing as how the school is placed in a quaint little town like Florence, Alabama, everyone is so friendly and you feel right at home. Unlike bigger schools, UNA's professors are able to give students more one on one attention by offering smaller classes, and students feel free to engage more, thus building their success! There are many organizations on campus that adhere to everyone's interests. From being a dancer as a Lionette in the Pride of Dixie Marching Band, to joining the Student Public Relations organization, there are many opportunities for students to gain crucial experience that will build their resumes. I adore UNA, and wouldn't change a thing about it. Did I mention they have live lion mascots on campus?","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2017-07-14T05:57:30.728011Z","guid":"00f6e25b-e83c-4f44-8067-ca825d2043b2","rating":5},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":3.33}],"photos":{"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-87.680999,34.80658,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-87.680999,34.80658,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.7764842840512225,"count":859},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Florence, AL"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/university-of-north-alabama/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"4c0c3bd6-d051-4db4-bea3-8aee452c57c4","content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"Christopher Newport University","type":"College","url":"christopher-newport-university"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.6216},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":22637},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"1060-1250"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Sophomore","body":"My first year at CNU was amazing!

The professors are helpful, some classmates become your friends, and your advisors become your motivation to push harder in your classes. Throughout the days, months, and years I've gone to college. People learn to become adults because they have to keep up with their assignments, they have to learn to communicate with others around them especially their professors. Ask questions, be honest and don't give up. College is tough but we are not alone, there will always be someone to help you along the way but we must make an effort and try. The number one rule in College is communication. From the experiences I've had in college you learn what it's like to become an adult it may soumd strange to say that but it's true. You are responsible for what happens next. I'll tell you one thing your tears, frustration, discouragement that you feel will eventually lead you to your strength and to your accomplishments in life.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2018-05-30T19:00:09.443743Z","guid":"37a6fa02-290b-4011-9a71-1674345449d3","rating":5},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":2.33}],"photos":{"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-97.882342,27.524852,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-97.882342,27.524852,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.479041916167665,"count":1002},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Kingsville, TX"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/texas-a-and-m-university---kingsville/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"32f81914-a6c6-44a9-b99b-7e5d09e4cc8a","content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"CUNY York College","type":"College","url":"cuny-york-college"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.4101},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":7528},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"810-960"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Junior","body":"My experience at York College is great!

Another great thing about this university is that laptops and textbooks are included in tuition. Aside from the academic and campus culture, the community culture is also amazing.

Shuttles that run every 20 minutes, so getting from main campus to downtown is not that hard. The problem is that sometimes drivers are late, they leave early, and some shuttles are too small to hold everyone. Security wise, there are emergency telephones around campus, and campus police drives around occasionally. I had a fantastic stay in the hotel-like freshman dorm, Clearview Hall. Too bad sleeping in the same room as your roommate is the only option. When I became a sophomore, I was upset with the rundown housing in Courtyard South/One. I will be moving to Courtyard North next semester and it is way better! I am not a big fan of the foods, but some days are better than others. The cafe is buffet style with a salad bar, pizza, hibachi, \"main event\", and desserts; they server different things for breakfast, lunch, and dinner.

There are plenty of options all around campus even for people who are vegan or gluten free.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2018-01-04T18:05:31.645922Z","guid":"75dbd13a-b2cb-48d5-9a39-bdfc151c0ea1","rating":5},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":3}],"photos":{"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-73.467342,44.691103,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-73.467342,44.691103,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.526315789473684,"count":665},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Plattsburgh, NY"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/suny-plattsburgh/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"d8707476-b692-442f-a893-12d5b664f2cd","content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"University of Texas - Tyler","type":"College","url":"university-of-texas---tyler"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.6935},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":12492},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"950-1150"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Junior","body":"I transferred to the University of Texas at Tyler after I finished my basics and have loved every second of it here!

The beautiful campus, excellent faculty, and overall atmosphere come together to form a holistic environment in which a student feels motivated to be better.  Though, it goes far beyond the simple fact that the school is building new facilities...any school can do that. Rather, its the culture that exists where the school itself is constantly striving to be better, which is why our mascot, the pioneer, is fitting. SHU is constantly pioneering what a college can be. Being a part of this truly makes a difference in the students' college experience.

I refused to research the school because I did not believe Winthrop was the place for me; however,  I toured the campus about three years later.  One reason why is because of the campus's size. In my opinion, Winthrop is a smaller Clemson. Furthermore, the student ratio is 15:1. Another reason is the convivial atmosphere. Winthrop's faculties are organized, easy to find, and productive. For example, the student center has over four different restaurants and the workers are nice. The staff occupying these places such as the recreation center, bookstore, and admissions office are welcoming, helpful, and friendly. Last but not least, Winthrop has the graphic design program which is my intended major. Thus, I have been accepted into Winthrop University and I am looking forward to finish in two years. I love Winthrop.

It has met my expectations and beyond. One of my favorite things about the university is the class sizes. I love how small the classes are. They are usually made up of 15-20 students! it makes it so easy to focus and learn. You really get that one on one time with your teachers. The teachers are so kind and genuinely care about you as a student and will help you do everything in their power to help you be successful. I would definitely recommend this university to my high school friends.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2018-03-11T03:28:23.237252Z","guid":"e68e0c79-62c9-4db1-ae20-4f81b41f765c","rating":5},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":3}],"photos":{"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-98.467709,29.468052,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-98.467709,29.468052,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.660919540229885,"count":1566},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"San Antonio, TX"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/university-of-the-incarnate-word/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"a13c42b0-586d-4007-9bde-0b82d4c8934e","content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":true,"isPremium":false,"name":"University of North Carolina at Pembroke","type":"College","url":"university-of-north-carolina-at-pembroke"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.7356},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":10566},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"840-1010"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Sophomore","body":"The experience at UNCP is phenomenal! There are numerous resources on campus and off campus for in-state and out of state students, to be successful. They help you in ALL categories that college students need help in such as, housing, job/money opportunities, tutoring, centers to help with assignments, food banks, plenty of fun activities, & shuttle buses for traveling off campus to local stores. Only thing I would like to see improved, to some point, is just more parking areas. Overall, this university is a well-rounded, filled with diversity & outstanding professors that actually help you.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2017-12-30T06:06:13.531219Z","guid":"042cb5a0-fa54-4e96-bfff-1313b9958c80","rating":5},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":2.33}],"photos":{"default":{"crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/8047b16335b962efd33fcc13695d1460bfb56e37.jpg","MobileHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/bc20a950eb330adbc6eba91c00ab9f6930bf6548.jpg"},"licenseName":"UNLICENSED"},"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-79.201895,34.687231,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-79.201895,34.687231,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.4536082474226806,"count":970},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Pembroke, NC"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/university-of-north-carolina-at-pembroke/#scatterplot"}}]}
