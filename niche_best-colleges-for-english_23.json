I transferred from a community college to TWU as an incoming Junior to attend the dental hygiene program for the class of 2019. This university has open many doors for me and has allowed me to grow both as a student and as a future healthcare provider. The campus is great, not huge, not small but just the perfect size. During my time I have attended numerous student life events and the students are awesome.  As far as academics go, the school offers many opportunities to choose from so I’m sure incoming students will feel at home. Moreover, the professors are friendly and really want you to succeed, so if you’re the type that worries about not having individual attention, no need to worry here because the class ratio is perfect for that matter. Overall, I am proud to have chosen this school as my number one choice to further my higher education.

I find that CSULA is very safety-conscious, maintains an excellent campus environment and student life, and hires very impressive and motivated professors who instill knowledge and their own passions into the students they teach. However, if there are two aspects that I would like to see CSULA improve on, they would be the local area and campus food. I would appreciate it if there were interesting activities to participate in in the local area and if there was a much bigger variety of healthy food choices aside from the food trucks and the food court.

Cannot beat the small class sizes and professor attention. Coming from Rutgers university i really appreciate that. Not as cutthroat as rutgers or other schools. I also actually like that each professor takes attendance and counts it as ten percent or more, of your grade. This encourages class attendance and pushes their students to do well. It is very possible to get a 4.0 if you show up to class and put in the effort, which for some classes requires less work than others.  I gave 4/5 because of the parking situation although they are trying to improve this situation by adding across the street parking. Parking is available but you may need to walk a bit or take the shuttle from other parts of campus. I also received 150$ cougar dollars because i was taking a saturday course which is awesome and very helpful for a broke college students!","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2017-10-08T21:38:46.586276Z","guid":"d6dc4cb1-4607-4bec-83c2-53169838cc8f","rating":4},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":2.66}],"photos":{"default":{"crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/859a4d9d0796621f891ab53ccda6c6fd903ed3a4.jpg","MobileHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/f07fa8da1eafb01ef2100eaac2340260ff021fcc.jpg"},"licenseName":"UNLICENSED"},"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-74.234668,40.679429,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-74.234668,40.679429,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.5614320585842147,"count":1229},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Union, NJ"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/kean-university/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"f78f2ee4-a901-4d21-b96f-9cc9be5e8291","content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"SUNY College at Old Westbury","type":"College","url":"suny-college-at-old-westbury"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.686},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":10050},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"880-1060"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Freshman","body":"Went to SUNY College at Old Westbury open house this weekend and this college is very welcoming.

It's also a good size to get from one end to the other, unlike some of the \nlarge campuses I'd seen. The grounds are well-lit, clean, and pretty. There are a number of housing options once you decide you're done with dorm life, including many homes for rent in the area. I like that we are taught by the professors and not aides. I appreciate that we don't have to be entered onto a waiting list for entry into specialized studies pertaining to our majors. I do feel that Whitewater athletics should be recognized more statewide, as we have some of the best athletes/teams around! The student enrollment is diverse, allowing interactions with people not only from around the US but the world! And tuition is more affordable than some of the other state universities, yet we get the same (or better) educational offerings. My experience with UWW has been very enjoyable.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2017-11-05T15:32:20.832692Z","guid":"459f27a1-bebe-444b-bd0e-0daa5bb56f06","rating":5},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":3}],"photos":{"default":{"crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/377333c08fe7891f2723cf399dd03a2977a17962.jpg","MobileHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/6b205393e1ddcb9e045bd0682a63f3ff4b421836.jpg"},"licenseName":"UNLICENSED"},"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-88.742368,42.835563,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-88.742368,42.835563,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.535,"count":1200},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Whitewater, WI"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/university-of-wisconsin---whitewater/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"5397fb8a-dbb0-4bcd-8a6d-41da2249323d","content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"Minnesota State University, Mankato","type":"College","url":"minnesota-state-university-mankato"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.6249},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":13812},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"886-1106"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Sophomore","body":"I really enjoy all that the school has to offer in terms of extracurriculars.

The people that make up SDSU are top notch and in my opinion there is no place better!","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2018-03-12T19:45:59.204145Z","guid":"e8293596-f56e-4faf-9e70-65f8ae2a81f4","rating":5},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":3}],"photos":{"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-96.783415,44.31942,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-96.783415,44.31942,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.4672818791946307,"count":1192},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Brookings, SD"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/south-dakota-state-university/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"96bd5c4f-43dc-4ffd-967c-043ccc8d0169","content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"Central Washington University","type":"College","url":"central-washington-university"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.7971},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":14080},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"960-1150"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Freshman","body":"What I loved about Central Washington University the most is that our campus is very focused on making Central feel like home and that everybody deserves to be treated with the same respect despite color, creed, religion or sexual orientation. Everybody has a place where they can fit in while also getting along with others who are different from them. Our campus is also very active! Something is always going on somewhere. Central really pushes for a 4 year graduation but also encourages you to move at your own pace while enjoying college while you can.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2018-05-02T19:35:54.967428Z","guid":"a73e645e-4500-4974-842c-bd47a0eec8b9","rating":5},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":3}],"photos":{"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-120.537716,47.004957,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-120.537716,47.004957,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.5284552845528454,"count":1353},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Ellensburg, WA"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/central-washington-university/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"86825bfe-4bfd-45f6-992b-af03615faa7b","content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"Southern Illinois University Edwardsville","type":"College","url":"southern-illinois-university-edwardsville"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.893},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":15360},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"898-1063"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Junior","body":"Southern Illinois University Edwardsville provides students with a diverse and inclusive community. It is tight-knit and student-focused, and the professors are knowledgeable in their fields and are passionate when teaching and interacting with students. SIUE's campus is safe, being ranked the 11th Safest College Campus in the nation. Residential life on campus is a great way to stay involved and active in the abundant number of organizations on campus. The city of Edwardsville, IL provides various experiences from local bike paths and trails, to restaurants and shops galore. Only 20 minutes from St. Louis, it is a great way to take a trip across the river. There is never a dull moment on SIUE's campus, whether it be eating a banana split from a canoe or attending a sporting event with the rest of campus. College is what you make it; make your experience worthwhile at SIUE!","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2018-05-15T13:33:31.441658Z","guid":"dcfa0ea5-f482-4f5a-9007-ec090832a9bd","rating":4},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":3}],"photos":{"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-89.997779,38.793949,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-89.997779,38.793949,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.5502063273727646,"count":1454},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Edwardsville, IL"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/southern-illinois-university-edwardsville/#scatterplot"}}]}
