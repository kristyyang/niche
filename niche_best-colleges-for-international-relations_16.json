I've met the best friends and people along the way. Everybody makes it feel like home and are so welcoming. There are tons of diversity people on campus and we are all involved in helping them fit in and having the best experience in the states as possible. The teachers are all understanding and want to be a parent influence when you're there since our parents aren't there to help us when it's needed.  Overall the education programs are amazing and I can't wait for my Nursing program to start. The food is really good and they have different variety's of food. For example, I am vegetarian so they have vegetarian dishes available everyday 3 times a day. I love Wartburg and I'm glad I chose this school to help me with my education.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2018-06-02T01:20:22.256543Z","guid":"be6adf9b-4bca-4a6a-b710-5bd017fe9fd9","rating":4},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":3}],"photos":{"default":{"crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/39117a22e32d197805f6b3c9e2b155b12dbfccb0.jpg","MobileHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/c79dcc92727238997d763d0a98463e79cfd64a52.jpg"},"licenseName":"UNLICENSED"},"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-92.480933,42.727629,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-92.480933,42.727629,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.4751381215469612,"count":543},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Waverly, IA"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/wartburg-college/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"354cb874-17c1-45c3-b13d-1ca74116b880","content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"Randolph-Macon College","type":"College","url":"randolph-macon-college"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.614},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":26202},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"975-1190"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Sophomore","body":"I enjoy attending Randolph-Macon College.

Despite the not-so-great food selection, everything else is great! The moment you step on campus, everyone is super nice and welcoming. The fact that it's a small school (which means small class sizes) makes it very easy to develop a close relationship with your professors! The classes are all academically demanding, so as long as you try and do your work, you should be fine! Student life is pretty good as the RA's and CA's, as well as the clubs and organizations around school, come up with some fun events and activities that everyone can enjoy! It honestly is very easy to make friends, especially if you live in the dorms. UST offers some great academic programs and they are very generous when awarding scholarships. Overall, the University of St. Thomas is a great school.

Queens is a very small campus, it'll take you 5 minutes to walk to the farthest part on campus! The student body closely resembles that of the size of a high school (2,500-3,000) students. Queens is also a liberal arts school so here we focus a lot on the arts and you are required to take some arts courses because of this, but I loved it; it broadened my knowledge and forced me to take courses that I may not have taken otherwise. Because of the size of the school the ratio of professor to student is along the lines of 1:17, which is great because you are NOT known as just a number here, you are an individual that the Professor actually gets to know. It makes your experience better when you know that your Professor cares about you. If you enjoy truly being known on campus, small school/classes then Queens is the perfect fit for you!","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2017-03-27T23:30:42.679889Z","guid":"a05c4c87-4b5d-4d91-9c11-812f8209a19c","rating":4},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":3}],"photos":{"default":{"crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/4fcc168cf25c5c1ce850a03e16eb34c08a05786f.jpg","MobileHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/ddfa9942ddbe15172598d426c373c5f431b04ca4.jpg"},"licenseName":"UNLICENSED"},"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-80.832227,35.188929,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-80.832227,35.188929,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.579520697167756,"count":459},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Charlotte, NC"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/queens-university-of-charlotte/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"271075b3-07a0-450b-b4f3-78eb1fc7c03a","content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":true,"isPremium":false,"name":"Haverford College","type":"College","url":"haverford-college"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.214},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":21144},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"1320-1520"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Sophomore","body":"Haverford is an top-notch school academically with a very welcoming social environment for the most part.
