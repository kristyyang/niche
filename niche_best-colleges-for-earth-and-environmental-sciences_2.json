It wasn't really at the forefront of my mind but I'm so glad I decided to go here. I did the NU-in program and had a great time in London. My experience at the university has been super positive when it comes to academics and my social life. The professors are hard working and qualified, the people are friendly, there are a lot of kids from all over the world, and the campus is awesome! Most students come to Northeastern because of the co-op program which is the most significant part of the university. The university does a really great job of preparing students for the workplace and makes sure you are qualified and competitive when it is your time to apply for them. I would recommend this university to students who are social, hard-working and competitive.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2018-03-22T21:35:03.369409Z","guid":"79d52442-1c21-49a5-9876-27dccd81c450","rating":5},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":4.33}],"photos":{"default":{"crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/fe66f26254caf6de36fea90af9c4849312e4cb64.jpg","MobileHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/2a1f855cc82936d84ac86d8ca7db2777be300743.jpg","Thumbnail":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/63bbec5d35965d2eb9fdaca02a8d43cd5b1ef488"},"licenseName":"UNLICENSED"},"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-71.088782,42.339992,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-71.088782,42.339992,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.662531017369727,"count":3224},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Boston, MA"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/northeastern-university/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"9ea86cb5-e8a6-47e6-a219-fdcabc31ae51","badge":{"display":"Best Colleges for Environmental Science in America","ordinal":27,"total":382,"vanityURL":"best-colleges-for-environmental-science"},"content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"University of Virginia","type":"College","url":"university-of-virginia"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.2986},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":15945},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"1240-1460"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Sophomore","body":"I never thought that I would love college this much! The University of Virginia is AMAZING. I have learned a great deal from each of my professors. (I recommend using ratemyprofessor and thecourseform to help you choose them). I actually enjoy going to classes that aren't based on regurgitating information but processing it and actually learning. Additionally, with thousands of clubs, there are plenty of ways to get involved. On another note, there are many stereotypes of people who come to the University, but I promise that not all of us are preppy, rich, and white, though a good portion is. The only problems I have with UVA are the prices of tuition and the honor code. Tuition is expensive and instead of giving grants UVA sometimes gives a lot of loans. Although I love the honor code and what it stands for, it seems to target minorities and foreign students.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2017-08-02T21:55:52.066083Z","guid":"75238c1f-3ce8-4b96-9994-7e4da15e8a23","rating":5},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":4.33}],"photos":{"default":{"author":"vironevaeh","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/488e5eac782b88e31489b688d27c0788a2e5194e.jpg","MobileHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/b344039af213c2a3140fb29177c3b67b8827e6e5.jpg","Thumbnail":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/2e460d21389ae370e4fd05a62e1c1ccbecdf6fd5"},"licenseName":"CC BY-SA","licenseUrl":"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/","sourceUrl":"https://www.flickr.com/photos/vironevaeh/5200391948/"},"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-78.502599,38.036546,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-78.502599,38.036546,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.8272023233301065,"count":2066},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Charlottesville, VA"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/university-of-virginia/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"c35e497b-10bc-4482-92e5-f27941433b02","badge":{"display":"Best Colleges for Environmental Science in America","ordinal":28,"total":382,"vanityURL":"best-colleges-for-environmental-science"},"content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"Cornell University","type":"College","url":"cornell-university"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.1409},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":30014},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"1330-1530"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Alum","body":"Below are 3 things I consider Cornell as a great investment.\n1. reputation\nEvery people, including people at work, recognizes me as a \"smart Cornell girl\"\n2.

TAMU is also steeped in traditions that make it an incredibly unique college experience!","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2018-05-28T22:47:05.098811Z","guid":"1bcd4563-84cf-49cf-8e39-de2b0186e8dd","rating":5},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":4.33}],"photos":{"default":{"author":"stuseeger","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/ff5729663bd7a54277d74bd8984e13c49ccf7c45.jpg","MobileHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/7d1b079ee81a8a31c0d2ef4ed9a7a70f12598247.jpg","Thumbnail":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/f676617e01732b695d6b17acf63bafcf2e322892"},"licenseName":"CC BY ","licenseUrl":"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/2.0/","sourceUrl":"https://www.flickr.com/photos/stuseeger/1236808146/"},"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-96.340322,30.613226,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-96.340322,30.613226,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.946622579121398,"count":6351},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"College Station, TX"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/texas-a-and-m-university/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"465d4a73-875c-498e-9c8f-e47568e156f2","badge":{"display":"Best Colleges for Environmental Science in America","ordinal":39,"total":382,"vanityURL":"best-colleges-for-environmental-science"},"content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"Williams College","type":"College","url":"williams-college"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.1761},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":18167},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"1330-1540"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"College Freshman","body":"I really enjoy being at my college.

The relatively small class sizes allow me to get to know my professors and classmates, which helps me learn better, as I can approach my professors comfortably during office hours and form study groups with my fellow classmates.

The athletics teams at this school are great too, with our football team's ever-increasing ranking. We have had several celebrities come to the University of Miami, parading around campus, throwing up the \"U\" at sports games, and notably even filming a music video here!

From political to adventurous student organizations, to meeting the very brightest professors and students in your chosen field, you will never cease to be amazed by the unlimited amount of opportunities available to you. For instance, I am a double major in Government and International Relations and Global Studies and am continuously amazed at the amount of programs, events, lectures , courses, and books available just for students in those majors. Your college's department of Career Services will blow you away as well, they will provide any and all resources to ensure your success after graduation. Most of all, UT is a highly respected university in the state of Texas and beyond, a degree from UT will go a very long way! I highly recommend studying here.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2018-04-04T20:57:10.298437Z","guid":"1b42f115-4293-493e-ab3c-4ebb9fead894","rating":5},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":4.33}],"photos":{"default":{"author":"jrandallc","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/062118de6b330627760d55de6c32cf824efa040b.jpg","MobileHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/8af2b0aa0e38489ab3331f7d629df02edec81728.jpg","Thumbnail":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/154967d69077062224951037e47fe52285fdde61"},"licenseName":"CC BY-SA","licenseUrl":"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/","sourceUrl":"https://www.flickr.com/photos/jrandallc/5207440826/"},"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-97.737279,30.284733,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-97.737279,30.284733,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.9090425531914894,"count":5640},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Austin, TX"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/university-of-texas---austin/#scatterplot"}}]}
