Many classes are discussion-based, making them very engaging. Campus is small & it only takes about 5 minutes to walk to class from most dorms. Lexington is a wonderful place to be, although pretty unsafe, which leads me to say that the safety on campus could improve, but that will likely happen soon as a result of an attack that occurred earlier this year. Dining locations on campus currently have unusual hours & sometimes students find that they want food when dining locations are closed, but Lexington as a whole has several nearby restaurants students can order from with their own money. Also, many cheaper housing options were closed down for next year so students will live in the brand-new dorms, which makes it harder for students to find affordable housing. Overall, though, I'd recommend this university to anyone who wants to go to a smaller school and/or live in a bigger city, and especially to artists because Lexington is a very artistic city.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2017-07-27T01:57:05.316293Z","guid":"4c908b63-69b0-4011-af13-ff14c0f24b5f","rating":5},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":3.33}],"photos":{"default":{"crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/8f36cce8c68337eb4666ce7eb7df61d7c92fc0bc.jpg","MobileHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/60571fb9bf154b85b95af6b752884503de2a182d.jpg"},"licenseName":"UNLICENSED"},"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-84.493883,38.053236,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-84.493883,38.053236,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.7111111111111112,"count":270},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Lexington, KY"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/transylvania-university/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"00533a39-6bb3-4db7-81bb-0cd5d7c91079","badge":{"display":"Best Colleges for History in America","ordinal":212,"total":640,"vanityURL":"best-colleges-for-history"},"content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"University of North Carolina - Wilmington","type":"College","url":"university-of-north-carolina---wilmington"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.7175},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":16218},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"1130-1260"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Alum","body":"UNCW lived up to all of my expectations. It is a large, beautiful campus, but the class sizes are relatively small. Even lecture halls have under 100 students. In my time at UNCW I grew close to many professors, and even was a TA. The only downfalls to this campus were parking and wifi. I had no other negative experiences. It is a fast growing school and I wish I didn't have to leave to go to grad school (they don't have physical therapy). In-state tuition is very reasonable, and I did not end up out of college drowning in debt. Overall, I would recommend uncw to anyone.

A lot of opportunities for internships, leadership positions and involvement. A lot of research opportunities and very good professors as well, especially for a public university. Despite the perception, OU is a lot more than just football and greek life. However, I would recommend that after freshman year, you live somewhere within walking distance to campus, because the parking here is absolutely awful and you will absolutely regret commuting to campus and spending nearly 2 hours looking for a parking spot everyday, even with a parking pass that costs hundreds of dollars. Also Dale Hall is a ridiculous building and if you have a class there, get there early because trying to make your way through the crowds in that building can sometimes take a while. The parking situation & Dale Hall is the only thing preventing me from giving this great school 5 stars.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2017-11-06T00:20:34.290457Z","guid":"75f25a4a-6e57-4df8-b0a2-0b3897295b1c","rating":4},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":4}],"photos":{"default":{"crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/6a7d7e2d5c708a009e6b4857db0d69cf2efb39c4.jpg","MobileHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/eeb1688e862a426894b97137be0e4145307a7a24.jpg","Thumbnail":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/0dfb8859200ebd86bfb0acaf4b7740bcc6822455"},"licenseName":"UNLICENSED"},"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-97.445692,35.208152,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-97.445692,35.208152,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.7810136157337366,"count":2644},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Norman, OK"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/university-of-oklahoma/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"660f3659-7387-4d8b-91d7-a3c56fd9f684","badge":{"display":"Best Colleges for History in America","ordinal":214,"total":640,"vanityURL":"best-colleges-for-history"},"content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"University of Portland","type":"College","url":"university-of-portland"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.6132},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":31736},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"1080-1300"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Freshman","body":"I have loved my UP experience so far!

I would recommend this campus to people who like to work hard but love to have fun.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2018-05-09T15:11:16.542546Z","guid":"8f0c0c3d-1ca9-4642-b691-34b0450a3aaf","rating":5},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":3.33}],"photos":{"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-83.814082,39.937463,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-83.814082,39.937463,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.6795977011494254,"count":696},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Springfield, OH"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/wittenberg-university/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"3d9f7ffe-5d9b-45af-815a-5ac0c2f4c52c","badge":{"display":"Best Colleges for History in America","ordinal":218,"total":640,"vanityURL":"best-colleges-for-history"},"content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"Gonzaga University","type":"College","url":"gonzaga-university"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.6729},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":33586},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"1110-1300"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Freshman","body":"Gonzaga is amazing!

Seton Hall athletics is one of the best parts of campus life. With 14 D1 sports teams there is always a game to watch and cheer on. The men's basketball team plays at the Prudential Center in Newark, NJ and they play in the Big East Conference. Going to basketball games is a highlight of the school year!\nOverall, social life on campus is awesome. There is always stuff to do on campus during the week and the weekends. Greek life is available on campus but will not make or break your experience. Like any school, it all depends on your willingness to put yourself out there - and SHU provides more than enough opportunities to do so. \nAlso, the FOOD is good! There are so many options and they change everyday.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2018-06-04T15:47:01.313883Z","guid":"67c0457c-4298-460b-8f22-c636e1cfaae0","rating":5},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":3.33}],"photos":{"default":{"crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/10c17ac338d092c6f9efeb8f4647806e6133a5e2.jpg","MobileHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/724f3858e89a297148ff496d8377ac95ea1db212.jpg"},"licenseName":"UNLICENSED"},"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-74.248753,40.742859,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-74.248753,40.742859,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.6006984866123397,"count":1718},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"South Orange, NJ"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/seton-hall-university/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"076d6457-e542-40e7-a649-71d8aad57f34","badge":{"display":"Best Colleges for History in America","ordinal":221,"total":640,"vanityURL":"best-colleges-for-history"},"content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"Whitworth University","type":"College","url":"whitworth-university"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.8857},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":27826},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"1000-1260"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"College Sophomore","body":"I have really enjoyed my experience at Whitworth so far!

I wish the price could be cheaper so that it was easier to enjoy such a great education at Whitworth. I have met great friends who would probably answer the same as me. Another improvement I think Whitworth could make is making sure that students are able to understand how to get a job once they have finished college.

Hunter offers a plethora of majors to choose from as well as different clubs to keep students engaged. There are also activities and events held on campus. The workload may be overwhelming at times but I regard it as excellent preparation for graduate school and an opportunity to challenge myself. The location of Hunter is convenient; it is located in the city so your choices don't fall short when it comes to food. Hunter has a library on nine floors. My complaint is that when you attend Hunter no one tells you anything unless you ask many, many questions! I know several people who took the incorrect class for their major, wasting time and money. Additionally, I feel that in large lecture halls with more than 100 students, there isn't a chance to receive individualized attention. The classroom size should be smaller so professors can focus on every students' needs and struggles.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2018-01-16T22:01:16.773582Z","guid":"61dee6aa-64ee-4526-9449-0dd06859694f","rating":4},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":3}],"photos":{"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-73.964795,40.768669,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-73.964795,40.768669,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.439636752136752,"count":1872},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"New York, NY"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/cuny-hunter-college/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"6784c328-54ab-4dd3-bff7-e2b2c20bfd5e","badge":{"display":"Best Colleges for History in America","ordinal":227,"total":640,"vanityURL":"best-colleges-for-history"},"content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"Luther College","type":"College","url":"luther-college"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.6763},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":25404},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"928-1198"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Freshman","body":"Luther College has a very friendly community atmosphere.The professors, and staff really care about their students, and encourage their success.

Despite the not-so-great food selection, everything else is great! The moment you step on campus, everyone is super nice and welcoming. The fact that it's a small school (which means small class sizes) makes it very easy to develop a close relationship with your professors! The classes are all academically demanding, so as long as you try and do your work, you should be fine! Student life is pretty good as the RA's and CA's, as well as the clubs and organizations around school, come up with some fun events and activities that everyone can enjoy! It honestly is very easy to make friends, especially if you live in the dorms. UST offers some great academic programs and they are very generous when awarding scholarships. Overall, the University of St. Thomas is a great school. As with every school, it does have its pros and cons, but all-in-all, your time spent here is going to be well worth it.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2016-12-20T17:36:38.487154Z","guid":"e33a7126-7e25-4d5c-a9d0-37b691ca0c80","rating":5},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":3.33}],"photos":{"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-95.394178,29.738113,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-95.394178,29.738113,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.5983050847457627,"count":590},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Houston, TX"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/university-of-st-thomas---texas/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"9855bf2c-00a5-472e-8536-6973663879a8","badge":{"display":"Best Colleges for History in America","ordinal":234,"total":640,"vanityURL":"best-colleges-for-history"},"content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":true,"isPremium":true,"name":"Saint Michael's College","type":"College","url":"saint-michaels-college"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.77},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":31264},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"1060-1290"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Sophomore","body":"Everybody here is really passionate about what they do. Students and professors. That liberal arts mentality of leaning for its own sake and valuing the humanities is strong here. I wish there was a film studies program so I could double major, but my experience with the English program has been excellent.  If you want to study what you love, this is a great environment for that. Academics are challenging and immersive once you get past the introductory classes, and 100 level courses are always really interesting without being overwhelming. \n\nIn terms of student life, the area is excellent. Burlington, Essex, Winooski, and Shelburne have a lot to do. People here are really active and you should have no problem finding people to hike, ski, or otherwise head off-campus with on the weekends.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2018-05-04T19:07:34.589209Z","guid":"7c863d21-92ab-4250-8642-b258baa734c9","rating":4},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":3.66}],"photos":{"default":{"crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/904e070072801d0591b19790e81cf50c4c98d082.jpg","MobileHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/1fb596220b2f64512ad8d1ef46a41e24d3e9bcc4.jpg"},"licenseName":"UNLICENSED"},"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-73.163136,44.494212,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-73.163136,44.494212,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.7388663967611335,"count":494},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Colchester, VT"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/saint-michaels-college/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"28321e38-d415-41b1-8928-c40b4a3cb24b","badge":{"display":"Best Colleges for History in America","ordinal":235,"total":640,"vanityURL":"best-colleges-for-history"},"content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"Birmingham-Southern College","type":"College","url":"birmingham-southern-college"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.4839},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":24630},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"990-1180"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Sophomore","body":"This school has taught me a lot about myself in all aspects of life.

The professors really care about each student's needs and goals, and they are willing to help students at a personal level. There is always something to do on campus and most people I have met (in and out of classes) are nice and outgoing. The campus definitely has a home feel for me. Some downsides are the food (which isn't great) and some of the extra things that come with it being a small school. For example, registering for certain majors can be extremely difficult because of limited class options and there are less options for housing, food, and activities than on a larger campus. Des Moines is also a nice in-between sized city! There is always something to do but it isn't a huge adjustment if you come from a smaller area.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2018-05-31T04:35:19.549811Z","guid":"24632281-62d0-4d5a-909b-f782c1b1f5aa","rating":4},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":3.66}],"photos":{"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-93.654062,41.60381,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-93.654062,41.60381,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.663507109004739,"count":844},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Des Moines, IA"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/drake-university/#scatterplot"}}]}
