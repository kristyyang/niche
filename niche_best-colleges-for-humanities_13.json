However, if I really had to say one thing that could change it would be something as small as providing more cheap and healthy food choices around campus.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2018-03-05T00:09:26.253476Z","guid":"e6812564-5e0d-45ce-a9e8-90f88197c91e","rating":5},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":3}],"photos":{"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-112.160021,33.60726,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-112.160021,33.60726,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.85929648241206,"count":199},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Glendale, AZ"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/arizona-state-university---west-campus/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"1d82d046-ae89-4750-92ef-06f75376f8b3","badge":{"display":"Best Colleges in America","ordinal":264,"total":1644,"vanityURL":"best-colleges"},"content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"Mercer University","type":"College","url":"mercer-university"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.6935},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":20692},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"1100-1290"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Senior","body":"Mercer University is a great school overall. The people here made me feel so welcome, and I truly felt like part of a family during my 3 years as a student. Most of the professors are incredible people; I could tell they wanted to see me do well. Because of the small class sizes, it is really easy to build relationships with your professors and get to know other students. For me, this really helped to ensure my success in classes. In addition, there are lots of organizations and volunteer opportunities on campus to help students get involved in the community and feel at home. The campus is absolutely beautiful! However, housing isn't the greatest; some of the dorms are rather old. A few dorms are new or have been renovated recently, so those offer a better living situation. Also, there aren't many food options on campus, and I rarely visited some, as the food was inedible. The meal plans they offer are ridiculous and are not at all worth the money you are asked to spend.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2018-05-16T15:00:30.995265Z","guid":"d47ebb91-ecd3-4e3c-be64-d26c66817072","rating":4},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":3.66}],"photos":{"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-83.651042,32.829731,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-83.651042,32.829731,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.582269503546099,"count":1410},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Macon, GA"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/mercer-university/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"f36f062d-49d8-491e-a8c1-a148d092ff5b","badge":{"display":"Best Colleges in America","ordinal":291,"total":1644,"vanityURL":"best-colleges"},"content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"Kalamazoo College","type":"College","url":"kalamazoo-college"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.6566},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":27958},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"1078-1370"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Freshman","body":"Love the community of people, everyone is very accepting and helpful.

I will be an incoming freshman this fall and while I was at orientation I noticed a lot of awesome things. First off, the professors and faculty members at Hofstra are there to make sure you're at your best 24/7. There's so many places to go to receive help, it's very reassuring especially when you're having a bad day. Next, the campus and the dorms are nice. The campus is very large which means a lot of walking, but it's not that bad because there's such beautiful architecture and landscaping to look at. The dorms are small and neat, but there's air conditioning which is a major plus. I got to sit through a real college class, which at Hofstra are relatively small. The food at Hofstra has a pretty good selection, but nothing crazy. There are Starbucks, Dunkin Donuts, Subways, Sbarros, and many other places to grab a bite to eat. Overall, Hofstra has a lot to offer and I couldn't be more excited to start my 4-year journey there!","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2017-08-17T13:19:43.218362Z","guid":"0f59bdeb-af97-4200-988e-1f0722fbf2d9","rating":4},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":3.33}],"photos":{"default":{"crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/2fb77d3e7ebcda2dfc09ad08572622874a2ade97.jpg","MobileHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/667677aae7cb8cd43b8b8fa8cb1993cc9e04e87a.jpg"},"licenseName":"UNLICENSED"},"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-73.60078,40.715959,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-73.60078,40.715959,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.483424047501237,"count":2021},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Hempstead, NY"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/hofstra-university/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"1e8f6bd2-1d23-4bba-992b-165f20d1def2","badge":{"display":"Best Colleges in America","ordinal":248,"total":1644,"vanityURL":"best-colleges"},"content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":true,"isPremium":false,"name":"University of Houston","type":"College","url":"university-of-houston"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.5854},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":15571},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"1040-1250"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Freshman","body":"Amazing university.

I love seeing the diversity here at MSU, and at the same time realizing that we are all here for one goal, and that is being taught to be well-rounded professionals for “the real world”.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2018-04-13T19:30:25.532473Z","guid":"89d45621-9f52-41bc-b46c-9c9bee3a797c","rating":5},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":4}],"photos":{"default":{"crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/c0937e3ef5ea37e17fe1c8fe728abe009ee6ecc4.jpg","MobileHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/f5136c486c1d7aee0938da37d874c8f2c90d108e.jpg","Thumbnail":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/ade2bf07163c70dccd621ad6a5ced5dd4ff0ce24"},"licenseName":"UNLICENSED"},"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-88.78834,33.455241,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-88.78834,33.455241,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.843767011431682,"count":1837},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Mississippi State, MS"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/mississippi-state-university/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"19156948-0891-4637-9bf6-2b7e489aacc6","badge":{"display":"Best Colleges in America","ordinal":240,"total":1644,"vanityURL":"best-colleges"},"content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"Ohio University","type":"College","url":"ohio-university"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.7485},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":21899},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"990-1200"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Sophomore","body":"Ohio University is more than just the four years you are here. It's about the lasting memories you make and knowledge you gain. While it is a bit taunting to go out and enjoy the social and bar scenes around campus, OU is all about time management. It's very hard to get caught up in the fun of things and forget about academics. But it is most certainly not impossible. If students take their time here, and use the networking and resources that are available it is absolutely amazing the places you can go. The oppritunities are so beyond contrary belief.  \n\nCollege has been the best time of my life, Ohio University has already opened so many doors for so many and it just keeps growing and getting better.

I came into this school having no direction or plan and it wasn't long before Roanoke helped me discover my passion. Small class sizes make it so easy to develop connections with both your classmates and professors. You aren't just a number here, and, personally, these connections have helped me grow and recognize my strengths and talents. In return, I have been given so many wonderful opportunities at this school that have truly prepared me for life after graduation. I would recommend Roanoke College in a heartbeat.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2017-11-28T16:42:23.7757Z","guid":"ea476743-e41a-4926-81b0-9a29f34ee366","rating":5},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":3.33}],"photos":{"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-80.056433,37.29686,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-80.056433,37.29686,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.611940298507463,"count":670},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Salem, VA"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/roanoke-college/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"3e3b4110-0c43-4d56-b5f9-6c060dc07841","badge":{"display":"Best Colleges in America","ordinal":300,"total":1644,"vanityURL":"best-colleges"},"content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"University of North Florida","type":"College","url":"university-of-north-florida"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.6453},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":13484},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"1040-1220"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Alum","body":"I am now a graduate of UNF with a B.S. in Biology. I had a great time at the school and quickly found employment as a full time biologist with U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service in Jacksonville; though, I would consider myself the exception in the biology department. Most of my peers who are more than qualified for positions are still struggling to find jobs.\n\nMy experiences in the biology department were overall very good, though I would like to see more variety of classes offered, and more internship options. The teachers were great and some of the courses were challenging (genetics, physiology). Do not wait until your last 2 semesters to find a senior seminar project and take genetics/physiology! Make sure to work in someones lab as an undergraduate to gain research experience and increase chances of job placement after school!","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2018-01-23T04:47:06.762071Z","guid":"7f19e77d-b23b-452f-9c1b-9f62c11a9d5c","rating":4},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":3.66}],"photos":{"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-81.507853,30.270917,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-81.507853,30.270917,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.6198547215496366,"count":2478},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Jacksonville, FL"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/university-of-north-florida/#scatterplot"}}]}
