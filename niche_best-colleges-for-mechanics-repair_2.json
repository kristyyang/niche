They are very well known all over the country for their School of Engineering, which is the reason I am there, and I have to say I am very impressed with their organization of classes, schedules, and events not to mention how excellent the Professors are. Most of them have their Doctorate and are knowledgable well above their years. If this sounds like a University that fits you, I encourage you to give it a shot for yourself and take a tour here sometime.

While i dont live on campus, there are many activities and events that you can attend, as well as organizations. I love Siena, as i am double majoring in Early Education and Child Development. As a double major, communicating with the teachers and advisors is a key part to it. Overall, I feel that Siena is the best choice for me, and have had great experiences with all teachers. While on campus, many of the staff members will get to know you by name, not as a number. To me, it is really important to recognize students and call them by name, as it makes you feel important. There is always a Campus Safety Guard around for emergencies, and they are very quick responders. The campus is well diverse, but all students are welcoming and accepting of each other.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2018-04-27T01:09:36.640892Z","guid":"f5eb111c-ee6c-47f4-b1bf-ef96ce0c7c89","rating":4},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":2.66}],"photos":{"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-84.015144,41.905952,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-84.015144,41.905952,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.4545454545454546,"count":440},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Adrian, MI"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/siena-heights-university/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"57646976-d639-4bb7-a989-576b7e680c2d","content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":true,"isPremium":false,"name":"Vaughn College of Aeronautics & Technology","type":"College","url":"vaughn-college-of-aeronautics--and--technology"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.7393},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":31082},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"885-1093"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Freshman","body":"Very involved and handon learning environment.
