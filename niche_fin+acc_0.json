Because social -- and often intellectual -- life centers around student organizations, I've had the chance to meet people who share my passions. In lieu of Greek life, student organizations host parties that foster a sense of community that centers around something deeper than hazing or a few Greek letters. The professors are caring and encourage you to think for yourself. Another thing I want to emphasize is the effect of Jesuit values. I was hesitant about them coming in because I'm not religious, but Georgetown doesn't shove religion down your throat. Rather, the school makes a concerted and largely successful effort to instill Jesuit values into all aspects of the community, such as the values of empathy, care, and intellectual risk-taking.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2018-05-30T01:34:22.337211Z","guid":"978b0f5f-2601-433d-8a81-599a051a623f","rating":5},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":4.33}],"photos":{"default":{"author":"bootbearwdc","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/12abac16c83fda20334b5c577c5b4ec014e75704.jpg","MobileHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/120f5736f8423c08516a76bf1a3fd36cc3ebf457.jpg","Thumbnail":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/47a9f5b83376225e5d4b4f612ef47b38724d2850"},"licenseName":"CC BY ","licenseUrl":"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/2.0/","sourceUrl":"https://www.flickr.com/photos/bootbearwdc/57647301/"},"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-77.073463,38.908809,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-77.073463,38.908809,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.7115559599636034,"count":1099},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Washington, DC"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/georgetown-university/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"65fdac21-46a7-4a0a-9a6c-dceb8d57e762","badge":{"display":"Best Colleges for Accounting and Finance in America","ordinal":3,"total":652,"vanityURL":"best-colleges-for-accounting"},"content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"University of Notre Dame","type":"College","url":"university-of-notre-dame"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.1873},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":26683},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"1350-1540"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Alum","body":"Notre Dame is an amazing place to get a high quality education with great reputation and close-knit community feel with fun and spirited student life. It’s not necessary to be Catholic and people who aren’t religious at all won’t feel excluded, but it is especially amazing for people who are religious. I myself am not very religious but was raised in the faith and do appreciate it, so I enjoyed being around it and taking the required Theology and Philosophy courses. Everyone is extremely nice and collaborative! Very smart people here and caring professors. Single sex dorms is a negative as well as less opportunities for medical professions, as there is no hospital or medical focus here. I would say it’s best for business, engineering, or liberal arts.

Plus, the food is great!","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2018-02-26T00:32:00.7338Z","guid":"205edd72-1cb4-4f6c-975b-b6c1df4313c5","rating":5},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":4.33}],"photos":{"default":{"author":"billdamon","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/abba88494b389782ce90a7174f73e4383a483010.jpg","MobileHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/f38939147f7db0c417f687c3ed7f2d20431aa5e9.jpg","Thumbnail":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/cd4e48b6121d0de72722fb18482dd9e46d5d20e9"},"licenseName":"CC BY ","licenseUrl":"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/2.0/","sourceUrl":"https://www.flickr.com/photos/billdamon/14010939333/"},"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-71.171488,42.337688,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-71.171488,42.337688,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.575912408759124,"count":1370},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Chestnut Hill, MA"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/boston-college/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"2c2398bc-a663-4ce4-93b9-37878535cce1","badge":{"display":"Best Colleges for Accounting and Finance in America","ordinal":7,"total":652,"vanityURL":"best-colleges-for-accounting"},"content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"Wake Forest University","type":"College","url":"wake-forest-university"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.3034},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":23826},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"1270-1410"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Alum","body":"The worst part of my 4 years at Wake Forest was graduating and having to leave!

The challenging coursework and excellent professors make Ohio State's academic experience one of a kind.

Overall, this university was perfect for someone like me: someone who wanted to focus on her studies but still have the opportunity to socialize and just have fun!","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2018-06-08T02:02:13.696067Z","guid":"3f39b0fe-3d50-4c35-8ec2-4e963d713df4","rating":5},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":4.33}],"photos":{"default":{"crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/8f43535583cdaa2ab96b1ff96cec5a5a8576ffde.jpg","MobileHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/c6bcbb1f19d0cd28c9602ae6d864079e458aa071.jpg","Thumbnail":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/8820399ac20c718edc35080c3909845d1408232a"},"licenseName":"UNLICENSED"},"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-83.374049,33.956428,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-83.374049,33.956428,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.9070371851259496,"count":5002},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Athens, GA"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/university-of-georgia/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"fed9be26-518d-4a71-ba22-cd4ad1066ffb","badge":{"display":"Best Colleges for Accounting and Finance in America","ordinal":20,"total":652,"vanityURL":"best-colleges-for-accounting"},"content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"University of Wisconsin","type":"College","url":"university-of-wisconsin"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.5262},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":15874},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"1200-1420"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Sophomore","body":"I'm only through two years at the UW, but they've been awesome so far!

I had a great roommate freshman year and have gotten involved in several clubs--cheese club, Badger Cru, Sconnie Sports Talk to name a few. One thing I would look to change is the emphasis that is placed on tests--I know it's unlikely to be changed, I just think it's tough for people, especially those who are bad test-takers, to have one test be 50% of their grade.

When I first came to Claremont McKenna, I feared that it would be difficult to make friends as it is such a small school. However, the first day shocked me completely. Everyone was so freaking nice, like unbelievably nice. In the last 3 months of being here, I know about 250/360 kids in my class, and of course a lot of upperclassmen. The party scene here is exactly what I want from a school ,inclusivity, but everyone definitely shares a work hard, play hard mentality. We know how to party, but we also know how to be the scholarly students we got in here for being. The party scene truly is spectacular. The dining hall food is amazing. Sports teams are great as 1/3 of the student body participates in sports There are pretty much a million ways to get involved on campus. I want to continue rambling about how much I love it here, but I also have an econ quiz tomorrow, but I hope that helps.
