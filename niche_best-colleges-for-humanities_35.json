The library is very large and accommodating for all needs whether using the computers, internet usage, or the study rooms for group assignments. The library and the student recreation areas are open until 12am. I am very lucky to be attending such a school that knows what students need to be successful.

In a regular classroom there aren't timed tests, you have the whole class period to take it. Giving timed tests doesn't let students think for themselves because they have to rush to get every single question.

The people and staff are welcoming, helpful, and hard working. The campus is comforting with its acres of woods surrounding it, and safe. Having various clubs and activities going on around campus, there is no excuse for having nothing to do. The services offered here are great, ranging from career assistance, tutoring, to health and fitness. My favorite part about the campus, and also the first thing I noticed was the many critters running around. We are accompanied by cute squirrels, chipmunks, birds, etc. If you are trying to get away from the city and home, the Johnstown campus is the perfect fit.

Soka is a great liberal art college with students from over 40 nations of the world. It has a small student body, which facilitates interaction with professors within and outside the classroom. The interdisciplinary education and diverse community of Soka provide students with an ability to view things from a broader perspective. \nWhat I particularly like about Soka is its unique program called Learning Cluster that takes place during the month of January. A Learning Cluster is a research seminar where students work in teams with faculty facilitators to investigate a specific question. It helps in bridging theory and practice, and evoke an educated outcome. Apart from its great education, Soka is aesthetically gifted with a beautiful campus and natural beauty of the surrounding canyon. It's a great place to visit and take a walk!","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2018-04-17T21:53:42.799254Z","guid":"f57bb919-3da5-4472-972e-765418e0e377","rating":5},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":4.33}],"photos":{"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-117.734893,33.549425,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-117.734893,33.549425,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.910614525139665,"count":179},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Aliso Viejo, CA"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/soka-university-of-america/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"9ce1ff3f-7807-410f-a13f-0af6687fcde8","content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"Bryn Athyn College","type":"College","url":"bryn-athyn-college"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.4214},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":16857},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"785-1105"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Freshman","body":"Bryn Athyn is a great college to attend.

When I hear about students at other colleges today expecting \"safe spaces\" I chuckle. SJC is like the Marine Corps for your intellect. If you make it to graduation, you will know what it is to strain every intellectual sinew. You will know Aristotle, Shakespeare, Kant and Darwin, but not C++, cell biology, or feminist social theory. However, no intellectual exercise after college will ever intimidate you. You will be able to read. You will be able to write. You will be able to talk about important things. You will have some idea where all the ideas we take for granted come from. You will be comfortable considering possibilities others find dangerous and frightening.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2017-10-25T03:31:04.976931Z","guid":"d4e05a31-4df6-4f27-8c71-39a9ee117ef8","rating":5},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":3.33}],"photos":{"default":{"crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/74539e0e620b722801c61dcc5808fb58e07a6cb9.jpg","MobileHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/cd7801307237aadf59bcec9f227086ba07adeff0.jpg"},"licenseName":"UNLICENSED"},"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-76.491397,38.981513,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-76.491397,38.981513,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.7413793103448274,"count":116},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Annapolis, MD"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/st-johns-college---annapolis/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"3c49c46c-538e-45f7-a8d3-9dd80d0d3dc0","content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"Alaska Pacific University","type":"College","url":"alaska-pacific-university"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.5506},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":18026},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"830-1115"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"College Freshman","body":"I love the small community and the friendly school counselors and student body.

One, the subject matter is composed of questions that men have asked for centuries and will continue asking for the rest of time. Second, we read all original works which gives students a more true idea of the author's thoughts. Third, we use the seminar method which means that students don't just sit in class and listen to a teacher lecture. Students read the material and then come to class and discuss it among themselves in order to find answers. The teacher is only there to ask questions to promote and guide discussion and to keep the discussion from going too far off course. Fourth, the Catholic community is rock solid.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2017-01-11T18:40:03.42026Z","guid":"7830e3ca-4c82-4ab2-b6d0-4c856ff923cf","rating":5},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":3.33}],"photos":{"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-119.087141,34.429009,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-119.087141,34.429009,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":4.266666666666667,"count":30},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Santa Paula, CA"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/thomas-aquinas-college/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"f6e3f0a5-35d7-47ff-88b1-754f654d3a49","content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"Kuyper College","type":"College","url":"kuyper-college"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.7338},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":15426},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"900-1100"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"College Sophomore","body":"I absolutely love the small-school atmosphere at Kuyper, and the ease with which I am able to build relationships within the student body. The students Kuyper attracts all have similar goals and passions, and it is a joy to be surrounded by a family that will both push me towards excellence and walk that same road with me. \r\n\r\nThe professors are kind, intelligent, understanding, and well-equipped to prepare us with the knowledge we need to succeed. On several occasions I have had professors go out of their way to email or stop me in the halls to encourage me on a personal level. Not only do they each know me by name, but they remember details about my life and take time to invest in me both in and out of the classroom. \r\n\r\nThe Kuyper campus is beautiful, and with only one academic building, all classrooms are less than a 3-minute walk away. \r\n\r\nFaculty and staff are also warm and engaging, ready to answer questions and point in the right direction as needed.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2016-07-29T15:33:27Z","guid":"6547f173-fbfe-4e5d-8f0f-e0afe45df82d","rating":4},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":2.66}],"photos":{"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-85.592657,43.02195,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-85.592657,43.02195,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.8026315789473686,"count":76},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Grand Rapids, MI"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/kuyper-college/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"b73a8620-d11b-48e4-9b92-4123113f1a62","content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"Saint Mary-of-the-Woods College","type":"College","url":"saint-mary-of-the-woods-college"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.7302},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":19401},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"825-1030"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Alum","body":"This place is the perfect place to empower leaders. It breads strong, intelligent and capable leaders with a voice. SMWC absolutely changed my life and gave me opportunities I'm positive I wouldn't have had anywhere else. It's a setting designed to help students succeed. The smallness helps to give students more support from professors, faculty and staff and an easier time accessing resources. Town is just minutes away with plenty of things to do and places to go for a night out and away from homework. It provided me the opportunity to play college sports, make lifelong friends and launched me into a career I love just 2.5 months after graduation. Without a doubt the best decision of my life was to attend this college and I owe so much of my success to my alma mater and the faculty/staff who helped encourage, support and challenge me along the way.
