When choosing a school my senior year of high school, I was very torn between OSU and another school. Ultimately, I knew Ohio State was the best fit for me, and it has way exceeded my expectations since arriving in August. The amount of school spirit everyone has is unlike anything I've ever experienced and everyone truly is just so happy to be a buckeye. The challenging coursework and excellent professors make Ohio State's academic experience one of a kind. My only complaint about my is experience is, my dorm is very old and lacks air conditioning and study spaces. But after the weather cools down it's not a problem! With alumni stretching to all ends of the Earth, I'm so thrilled to be part of the wonderful Ohio State community.

Whether it's research or internships or pursuits fo further education, proactive St. Olaf students have many resources they can take advantage of. The curriculum is tough no matter what department you take courses in. Professors have extremely high expectations for their students, however they do everything in their power to build your way to those high expectations. It can be difficult to find a study/social life balance. If you cannot develop strong study habits, classes will be a struggle. There are a ton of resources available to students who haven't established study habits and professors are happy to work with students. The open-door policy is an awesome thing to take advantage of. There can be a sense of a competitive atmosphere, but usually there is a stronger sense of community and camaraderie between students because everyone is facing many of the same challenges in an academic sense.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2017-12-29T06:15:09.010955Z","guid":"0327f163-663c-474f-aa4e-9a560bc27a1d","rating":4},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":4}],"photos":{"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-93.183633,44.462884,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-93.183633,44.462884,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.617862371888726,"count":683},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Northfield, MN"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/st-olaf-college/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"a5576ab4-5b41-41d4-a687-6a0c32318e9a","badge":{"display":"Best Colleges in America","ordinal":62,"total":1644,"vanityURL":"best-colleges"},"content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"University of Florida","type":"College","url":"university-of-florida"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.4594},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":14761},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"1180-1370"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Freshman","body":"The University of Florida has provided me with the experience to not only growth in an academic perspective but also in my personal development.

Despite all of its flaws and imperfections, it is a safe space where I can explore and learn. The campus itself is a small city with features that make it feel more cozy than full-out sophisticated. From our beautiful Cathedral of Learning (we lovingly call her Cathy) to the spacious Schenley Park, there are tons of secret nooks that are perfect for studying. The professors, while teaching multiple classes, still make themselves available for questions outside the classroom. They are never too busy to stop and chat if you see them around campus; they really care about your education and that you have a passion for what you are studying. Overall, Pitt is an amazing college to attend. The community surrounding the campus challenge you and support you all at once. I’m extremely happy I made the decision to attend the University of Pittsburgh.

It's true that Nova isn't a big party school, but I think that's a perk.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2017-12-12T15:01:12.193275Z","guid":"0dd42eff-16d6-4e2b-94fe-4a3f5c27a154","rating":5},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":4.33}],"photos":{"default":{"crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/ca6cc3e8bb92995e7d42f026ae847a02e931cc3e.jpg","MobileHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/815a13eb4d7ef7ab77d2c15e472f67c91cca05d0.jpg"},"licenseName":"UNLICENSED"},"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-75.345457,40.039388,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-75.345457,40.039388,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.669034090909091,"count":1408},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Villanova, PA"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/villanova-university/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"7a7bbc0e-4d60-47db-91c6-2525f2d7b240","content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":true,"isPremium":false,"name":"United States Military Academy at West Point","type":"College","url":"united-states-military-academy-at-west-point"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.0966},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":0},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"1180-1390"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Alum","body":"This academy is not for everyone; however, those interested and willing to serve in the Army for 5 years and excel in leadership roles, are fit, and determined may enjoy it here.

The building's collegiate gothic architectural style is beautiful and well maintained. The food there was wonderful, the campus cafeteria put meticulous effort into preparing each meal. The academic side of university of the south is where they excel. The former graduates of the university are well educated and prepared for their career field. The athletics are less than satisfactory however; because the university is so goal oriented towards educating students. Partying at the university is not great because the students are less focused on social affairs. Overall The University of the South is a perfect place to go to college if your goal and life are built around education. I personally love this school, but if you are the sort of person who enjoys less of the scholar side I would not recommend it to you.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2016-09-28T23:50:25.349506Z","guid":"d0f39dfb-ab1e-4944-8b84-db9b302cc862","rating":4},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":4}],"photos":{"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-85.917772,35.20443,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-85.917772,35.20443,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.650990099009901,"count":404},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Sewanee, TN"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/sewanee---the-university-of-the-south/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"8c7f93e4-7738-43ab-81e2-876c5fef63ce","badge":{"display":"Best Colleges in America","ordinal":121,"total":1644,"vanityURL":"best-colleges"},"content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"Loyola Marymount University","type":"College","url":"loyola-marymount-university"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.5387},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":40946},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"1120-1330"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Freshman","body":"This university campus is beautiful!

Other than that, I have enjoyed being a student here and being a part of this community very much.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2018-01-10T19:34:35.293381Z","guid":"cf4b04f6-8efc-4646-a21f-5ed689c85cfb","rating":5},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":3.33}],"photos":{"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-84.289332,37.573334,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-84.289332,37.573334,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.2128146453089244,"count":437},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Berea, KY"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/berea-college/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"71a29184-cab0-4b93-b574-0fbf60e75e33","badge":{"display":"Best Colleges in America","ordinal":231,"total":1644,"vanityURL":"best-colleges"},"content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"Dickinson College","type":"College","url":"dickinson-college"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.4321},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":34409},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"1190-1365"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Sophomore","body":"I love Dickinson! My first year here was very satisfying all around as a student-athlete. I found the ability to balance both athletics and academics, which is crucial to all coaches and athletes. My expectations were surpassed especially with regards to campus awareness. This college is very aware of diversity and contemporary issues. Two of the main pillars of a Dickinson education--global citizenship and sustainability--are present in every major's curriculum. I've found that alum have been able to apply their skills to jobs that might not even be related to their major. This skill is more important than ever because in 5-10 years, there will be jobs and industries that do not even exist yet.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2017-08-01T14:37:26.301636Z","guid":"d47e0aa0-eed3-467c-86a2-4d804c27abcd","rating":5},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":3.66}],"photos":{"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-77.197854,40.202796,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-77.197854,40.202796,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.4772727272727275,"count":528},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Carlisle, PA"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/dickinson-college/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"7c5933a0-8dd6-4313-89cf-c9a3f41b7d3b","badge":{"display":"Best Colleges in America","ordinal":66,"total":1644,"vanityURL":"best-colleges"},"content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":true,"isPremium":false,"name":"Case Western Reserve University","type":"College","url":"case-western-reserve-university"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.3544},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":33124},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"1280-1490"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Junior","body":"I chose Case Western for my undergraduate education to pursue nursing, as the Frances Payne Bolton Nursing School is in the Top 10 in the country. When I visited the campus for the first time in snowy January 2015 from Phoenix, Arizona, my mind had a culture shock. Despite the weather (which I am now used to), I fell in love with Case and the nursing school because of the commitment to intelligence and hands-on learning. When I was in my second week of college ever, I was in the hospital interacting with patients. I even helped save someone's life before my first semester ended. Case shows so much dedication to its students and professors take the time to work with every individual.

Spring term at Union is still pretty lit though, given that we have ReUnion weekend, Lobster Fest, and Spring Fest. The social scene for the most part, given that Greek life makes up 70% of the student body (Union butchers this statistic as it includes freshman, even though you can't pledge until sophomore year) is getting blackout and going to an off campus party nowadays.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2016-12-22T18:45:44.991174Z","guid":"3f25e605-a90b-4599-8c44-58eda1d27e16","rating":4},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":4}],"photos":{"default":{"author":"jirka_matousek","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/1c50f212b43127310b4796fcdc08c4db170301ea.jpg","MobileHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/a085f7463737d2d7a537e43fac12c8fa2f8c5316.jpg","Thumbnail":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/ff1a2a9f6b4a027509cca9cc5f8c02efce604fcd"},"licenseName":"CC BY ","licenseUrl":"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/2.0/","sourceUrl":"https://www.flickr.com/photos/jirka_matousek/8374084149/"},"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-73.928498,42.817578,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-73.928498,42.817578,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.601923076923077,"count":520},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Schenectady, NY"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/union-college---new-york/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"2903a6b2-8158-4848-8d1a-81ebdbba393c","badge":{"display":"Best Colleges in America","ordinal":81,"total":1644,"vanityURL":"best-colleges"},"content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"Penn State","type":"College","url":"penn-state"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.564},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":25055},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"1090-1300"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Sophomore","body":"Penn State is an amazing campus with a multitude of career paths to choose from.

There is one particular thing that I would like to see change in the future at Penn State and that particular change is with academic scholarships for students.  Currently, Penn State only offers athletic scholarships at the main campus, and at branch campuses I was able to find out that they offer academic scholarships.
