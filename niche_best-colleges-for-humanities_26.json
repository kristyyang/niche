One of the biggest things that I think Cabrini needs to change is the size of the campus. Yes I understand that it is easier said than done.

I believe with the knowledge I am acquiring and the ability to communicate with diverse audiences, I am inspired and motivated to seek higher education in order to create a better quality of life for me and my family. UMSL has opportunities for developing leadership, networking, mentoring and team concepts that can put you on a path to achieve your educational goal.

The bluffs are beautiful and the nearby Lake allows the community to kayak and more for a small yearly fee.  The campus is really pretty and has been updated in a lot of ways--there is a caribou coffee and snack shop in the library (the library is beautiful, spacious, and bright btw!), they have added another newer coffee shop in Somsen Hall as well.  Yes like all colleges there are a lot of old buildings, but they have charm and history.  The Wellness Center is amazing--relatively updated and very modern looking.    The food court has also been remodeled and looks great as well.  Overall, I had a great time at the school--true, the city of Winona is a little bland, there is the typical movie theater and a couple restaurants that aren't chains, but its a small town.  Typically, people can travel to La Crosse or Rochester for the nearest mall or other adventures.  Honestly though, Winona State is beautiful and a pretty great school.

WNEU is well managed, with many opportunities to grow through clubs, activities, community involvement, and options to study abroad.    The campus is a must see, offering state of the art facilities and technology with impeccably manicured grounds and an amazingly clean campus.

Classes are relatively small, perhaps 25 maximum for a general education course or something else that's popular, but it's not unusual to have only 6 or seven in more major-specific elective-type courses. This allows you to be very friendly with fellow classmates and faculty, and really be able to understand what needs to be done and exactly how to do it, or at least have the option of quickly approaching your professors. It's located in a charming little town, but also close enough to both Scott Air Force Base and St. Louis to fulfill most needs. My only qualm is the old science building, because it needs some better desks (and it's only that particular building). Also may-or-may not be haunted.\n\nGood for people who want a relatively quiet place where you can still interact with plenty of people but can actually get your work done and learn something worthwhile.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2017-05-05T17:14:14.465182Z","guid":"092199f4-bf7a-4863-80d5-bb9931ee8852","rating":4},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":3}],"photos":{"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-89.814486,38.609431,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-89.814486,38.609431,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.4759725400457664,"count":437},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Lebanon, IL"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/mckendree-university/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"27892b90-4d52-46f2-a1c4-0b85c677129e","badge":{"display":"Best Colleges in America","ordinal":533,"total":1644,"vanityURL":"best-colleges"},"content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":true,"isPremium":true,"name":"Wisconsin Lutheran College","type":"College","url":"wisconsin-lutheran-college"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.9027},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":20146},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"1020-1250"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Freshman","body":"My experience at Wisconsin Lutheran was amazing. It was really nice even as I was a commuter! I loved the aid I received not only from my professors, but my classmates as well. The friendly people all around campus helped me to stay cool and focused on being on my \"A game\". I simply felt the positive desire to want to do well since I had positivity pushing on me. The experience was great. I aspire to continue to do well and keep my head up. Being at WLC motivates me to be an awesome student. It has molded me to be goal- oriented, so that I may surely have future success in my desired career, which is Theology.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2016-12-31T06:04:04.335903Z","guid":"25fbc022-72ed-44de-9c07-53d8c0cdda72","rating":5},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":3}],"photos":{"default":{"crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/96bcee2e974489b9cd5c72bd0a586be2c01a4b06.jpg","MobileHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/080a156fd4694a68b2f8c464a9f653871a54fc76.jpg"},"licenseName":"UNLICENSED"},"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-88.022718,43.036943,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-88.022718,43.036943,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.6803874092009683,"count":413},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Milwaukee, WI"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/wisconsin-lutheran-college/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"452530d5-60c6-4214-86a7-5e819543fb4b","content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"Long Island University - C.W.
