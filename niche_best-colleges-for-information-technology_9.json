The staff is well trained, and majority of teachers are willing to meet with students to explain how they can do better in classes. The school also has weekly events for the students that are provident by SGA. These events are well liked by the students they provide a variety of events like BINGO and making pillows. As far as food goes on campus, the cafeteria has a selection of different food items like pizza, subs, etc. The campus also has two Starbucks which have the majority of the same items as a full sized shop.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2018-05-27T17:30:46.968662Z","guid":"47c98d73-1e45-4d65-8be2-934d933f85bb","rating":5},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":2}],"photos":{"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-83.887982,36.869066,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-83.887982,36.869066,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.452830188679245,"count":106},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Barbourville, KY"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/union-college---kentucky/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"c65e2a91-f153-4d31-9aac-b838a7c2cd07","content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"Valley City State University","type":"College","url":"valley-city-state-university"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.9812},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":12073},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"810-950"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"College Sophomore","body":"My overall experience at Valley City State University has been very good so far.  Quite a few of my family are alumni from Valley City State University and have had great experiences from VCSU.  They talk highly of VCSU and feel that they have received a good education.  I really like the small size and the feeling of a small community where you are a name and not a number.  It is a college where it is affordable and most professors seem to care about you and if you are in class of not.  My favorite experiences are it has been easy to make true friends, be involved, and not feel overwhelmed with the size.  If I would have to choose again I still would stick with VCSU because it is a great school.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2016-02-23T22:32:49Z","guid":"e5110dfc-ca20-49cb-bb39-004546dcf8b7","rating":4},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":3}],"photos":{"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-98.001762,46.919144,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-98.001762,46.919144,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.5161290322580645,"count":93},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Valley City, ND"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/valley-city-state-university/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"d9af4a17-36e6-4039-8b42-83022cf18eb0","content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"Bluffton University","type":"College","url":"bluffton-university"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.4953},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":25101},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"840-1140"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Niche User","body":"When I visited Bluffton University I absolutely loved the campus.

Tons of helpful information and assistance when needed in applying for financial aid.  Not the big campus run around from one office to the next.  Everything simplified!
