DeSales is the perfect college for all those interested in attending a small Catholic College. The students are very welcoming and by the time you leave you feel like part of a large family. The professors are very willing to work with on if you have any questions or concerns. In addition, if you are a student-athlete the professors are very considerate and will work extra time if you miss class.  The dorms are very spacious and even as a freshman you only have to share a bathroom with three other people! There is also in-house cleaning that comes once a month to make sure your dorm is nice and clean. I would recommend the school to anyone.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2017-12-26T18:13:01.565829Z","guid":"da82578c-7457-4ffc-b333-d9003bdb87b2","rating":5},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":2.66}],"photos":{"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-75.376549,40.540137,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-75.376549,40.540137,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.3963782696177063,"count":497},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Center Valley, PA"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/desales-university/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"886d4ec6-99ce-4313-8502-798e1118a149","content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":true,"isPremium":false,"name":"Marymount University","type":"College","url":"marymount-university"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.9055},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":24719},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"860-1080"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Sophomore","body":"My experience at Marymount University has been great so far.

Although the tuition is high, their financial aid packages cover a lot of the costs. The campus is tiny, but it is nice. Some people have noisy neighbors in the dorms, as I did. They would scream karaoke at 3 am. Our school has \"quiet hours\" set in place, but they didn't always listen. The dorms have no air conditioning so my dorm was always hot. This could just be Assumption Hall. The food is always hit or miss. The Cafe sometimes tries to make fancy meals, but they come out bland. Other times they offer hand rolled sushi and it is delicious. The food is definitely overpriced as well. Lastly, the teachers. Some teacher loves what they're doing and love to work with you until you understand what you are doing. Other teacher don't understand how to convey concepts to students in a manner that is understandable. The class sizes are really small, so you get to know the teachers personally as well.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2018-05-26T12:06:20.707487Z","guid":"f7f3b755-d5e2-43cd-90b2-0e558278de46","rating":4},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":2.66}],"photos":{"default":{"crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/50cd8ad6a79a3f908b24b1eef182c511b41a3a7f.jpg","MobileHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/f03192df6ed14f508ab1f24f90449f9a08d806a6.jpg"},"licenseName":"UNLICENSED"},"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-72.730489,41.783028,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-72.730489,41.783028,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.437888198757764,"count":322},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"West Hartford, CT"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/university-of-saint-joseph/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"f029aba7-2639-401b-a1ef-fe28a75cb5fa","content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"St. Catherine University","type":"College","url":"st-catherine-university"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.9083},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":22519},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"975-1180"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Sophomore","body":"The diversity among students and staff was great!

This made it very difficult for me to actively participate in most of the events at school, which there were quite a few last fall that I would have loved to be a part of. They other thing that needs work is the parking situation on campus. There are not a lot of spots to park, most are tiny, and when you do get a spot, you may have to walk to the completely other side of the campus just to get to class! Other than those two things, my experience with St. Catherine University has been great thus far.

You are directly in the middle of older, traditional buildings/grounds/architecture, but has the same amount of updated technology and resources. It makes for a perfectly balanced experience. While the campus is smaller than many other schools, there is no shortage of activities and social scenes (both alcohol and non) surrounding the area. It has the perfect mix of students: young/older, traditional/non-traditional, day/evening, and a wide variety of different backgrounds and lifestyles.\r\n\r\nI love the one-on-one experience and assistance that I have received from the faculty and staff at Carlow University. The professors are extremely kind and fair, easy to communicate with, and make every attempt to help their students succeed. Of course you have some students who say same professors are horrible, but those are usually the ones who do not do their work. Personally, I could not attend a school where I'm one little seat in a big theater, and only 1 out our 300 students. I need the more personalized atmosphere and connections.

The small classroom sizes (I've been in a class with only 4 people!) allows for 1-on-1 connections between students and professors which has helped me better understand and stay engaged with the courses and the topics of the class. \n\nOne thing to note, I never wanted to attend CBU because of how like-minded the people are. It is a conservative campus and I am a conservative and I am a political science major looking for a challenge. Although professors are usually Christian and conservative,  they put on their Marxist and liberal thinking caps and made their students think about our own views; it was a challenge after all! They really want to help you think outside of the box and become a better individual in academia and in the professional world. I encourage you to invest your research and time, and attend this wonderful school!","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2018-05-10T02:21:42.216453Z","guid":"9276dd5b-e5e3-496b-af23-4187a0de7cd1","rating":5},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":3.33}],"photos":{"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-117.42587,33.928569,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-117.42587,33.928569,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":4.027061310782241,"count":2365},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Riverside, CA"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/california-baptist-university/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"245d037c-95fa-4a57-8c8c-c061cf791e92","content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"Georgia Southern University","type":"College","url":"georgia-southern-university"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.6455},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":16121},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"1030-1190"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Junior","body":"Georgia Southern is a great school! My favorite part of the school are the professors and other staff. Everyone is extremely nice and selfless. Whenever I need help with ANYTHING, there is always someone I can ask to get that answer. The environment here is great! It’s located in a small town, and everybody here has a lot of school spirit. Georgia Southern has the full support of the town and its people. Most importantly, the academics are exceptional. The professors are mostly always available when you need them, to provide help and support for each of their students. Although it is a fairly large school, I have a personal connection and relationship with all of my professors. And that is very important in College!","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2018-02-09T21:44:19.239491Z","guid":"c182534e-0173-4e69-a281-8d54c921c721","rating":5},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":3.33}],"photos":{"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-81.782201,32.427756,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-81.782201,32.427756,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.7481622651783284,"count":3673},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Statesboro, GA"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/georgia-southern-university/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"d6d22624-e98d-4f03-87d0-b80f3b72c7f8","content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"University of Missouri - Kansas City","type":"College","url":"university-of-missouri---kansas-city"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.6187},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":15368},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"980-1300"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Alum","body":"I majored in Health Sciences. I enjoyed my courses and the professors but my degree is too broad. I recommend specializing from the get-go; major in something specific like Nursing (UMKC has a fantastic nursing program) or Law, Medicine, Dental, etc. However, UMKC is a great school and is very diverse. It's affordable compared to most four year universities. I would definitely reapply for Nursing or a master's degree program in the future!","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2018-04-21T19:03:10.888588Z","guid":"a2ce6d29-d36a-4c92-933e-a47946083d31","rating":4},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":3.33}],"photos":{"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-94.578039,39.035366,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-94.578039,39.035366,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.5599022004889975,"count":1227},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Kansas City, MO"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/university-of-missouri---kansas-city/#scatterplot"}}]}
