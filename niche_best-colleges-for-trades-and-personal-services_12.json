I was involved in two years of full-time PSEO at the school, and am now a full-time undergrad student with three semesters of work left.  The environment is very nice; students, faculty, and professors are very easy to work and get along with.  The campus is located a couple blocks out of downtown Minneapolis, so it is a beautiful setting.  The school also has an extremely good business program, with many students able to find jobs immediately out of school because of the connections and skills they learn in the School of Business.  I would recommend this school to anyone looking for a smaller, private school in the Minneapolis area; it is well worth the investment!","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2017-11-17T14:55:53.678742Z","guid":"a8d44312-f1f3-49ce-a3fc-3b9f826255dd","rating":5},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":3}],"photos":{"default":{"crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/4138ec63861d19ff3cec67cf6362bc84e91de809.jpg","MobileHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/d72e889daf98f1ffc395d01742d3cc7fc6de7c58.jpg"},"licenseName":"UNLICENSED"},"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-93.261429,44.969389,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-93.261429,44.969389,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.728395061728395,"count":567},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Minneapolis, MN"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/north-central-university/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"4ab440ef-9926-4e4e-ac68-6cdbc81b4c6e","content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"Montana State University - Northern","type":"College","url":"montana-state-university---northern"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":1},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":10523},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"845-973"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Niche User","body":"I like the campus vibe, the students and staff are supportive.

You really get to know everyone well and make lasting friendships. Most people going to Paul Smiths have similar desires and interests. This makes it easy to find a friend that you can connect with. Location is whar separates this college from most. It is beautiful. Yes, it does get cold, but you are likely the type of person who has been outside enough to cope with the cold if you are going to Paul Smiths. Academically you get to know each of your professors very well. With small class sizes and labs there is a unique hands-on learning experience that other colleges just can’t match. One thing I would change is the food selection. There just isn’t much to choose from and what is prepared isn’t in that great of quality. The library is a great environment to get homework and studying done.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2017-12-29T03:38:51.712814Z","guid":"0ca54b74-b780-4cec-ab0f-a5907ec1c945","rating":4},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":2.66}],"photos":{"default":{"crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/7121bd656d8fa017fa1ed810f1dbaefe0c1779fa.jpg","MobileHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/7f7a37f02d742ea52228436195bc5825efa4318c.jpg"},"licenseName":"UNLICENSED"},"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-74.253006,44.437366,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-74.253006,44.437366,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.6650485436893203,"count":206},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Paul Smiths, NY"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/paul-smiths-college/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"d9487f36-2387-4f5c-a1d9-5ee75f233707","content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"Haskell Indian Nations University","type":"College","url":"haskell-indian-nations-university"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.8646},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":3893},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"800-1000"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Freshman","body":"Personally, I chose Haskell Indian Nations University as my first school because of athletics.

Its a great school to start your first year if you are financially unstable. Its also not too big but small enough for a comfortable settle. Another thing I like about it is, they offer a bridge program with the University of Kansas so you can take classes there at a cheaper price than actually going to KU. The students and staff are super friendly and will go beyond measure to make sure you are successful!
