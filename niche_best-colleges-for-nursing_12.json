I personally love this class size because it allows me to create more meaningful and authentic relationships with my professor in a setting where I can have more one-on-one instruction if needed. With the encouragement and help of professors and my advisor on campus, I have been introduced to the opportunity to travel and teach in England for the summer.

Friendly students and caring staff.  With the smaller class sizes the Professors are able to focus on the students.  They all are open and welcome visits to their offices.  It is a pretty campus, up front.  One major drawback is NO football team.  The Basketball teams do VERY well.   The athletic players are well supported by staff and students, but NOT given easy grades.  The food could be better.  There is a nice movie theater for students.  Could use a little more stuff in the student center to keep students on campus and not off looking for inappropriate things to do.  This university is located in a small rural TN town with nothing to do off campus.  Luckily there is a nice size town about 30 mins away that has a lot of fun things to do.   Many alumni stay in the area.

You form long lasting friendships with a lot of students. Class sizes are small. The professors want to see you succeed and are willing to help. The dorms are ok. The food has gotten better over the last year or so. The athletic facilities are great for a small school and are D2. The school is next to the city of Elkins and is walking distance to restaurants etc.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2018-02-12T03:56:21.384536Z","guid":"5d9def64-184e-405e-a66d-a357e271fc82","rating":4},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":2.66}],"photos":{"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-79.846391,38.928693,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-79.846391,38.928693,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.4865900383141764,"count":261},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Elkins, WV"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/davis--and--elkins-college/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"68fff115-cc07-42fe-ab72-a3a161e8178e","content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":true,"isPremium":false,"name":"Mount Vernon Nazarene University","type":"College","url":"mount-vernon-nazarene-university"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.7422},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":19235},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"920-1180"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Freshman","body":"Mount Vernon Nazarene University (MVNU) is one of the best colleges to transfer into as a high school student thanks to the wonderful staff and faculty and students already there who make people feel welcome and feel at home. MVNU is a very small, community based university so therefore it is easy to get to know someone fast and there is a lot of support for someone to be there. Academically, MVNU challenged me in ways my high school education could not and it has transformed me into a smarter and quicker learner, writer, speaker, and thinker. MVNU also has taught me over 1 semester how to be self-reliant and independent as an adult which is a great lesson to have in life. They do not call this school \"life-changing\" for nothing!","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2017-01-07T17:48:45.179887Z","guid":"9366d097-59da-441d-8a48-8a16adf17d79","rating":4},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":2.66}],"photos":{"default":{"crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/5b8d7340e92939cd80d02757b8f373be508d97a1.jpg","MobileHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/cdc1f40d90fc04f0f81c6840c3e847ff91d20d9f.jpg"},"licenseName":"UNLICENSED"},"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-82.474667,40.373859,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-82.474667,40.373859,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.4989939637826963,"count":497},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Mount Vernon, OH"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/mount-vernon-nazarene-university/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"10b3c5c0-e1a3-4d2b-8f61-6aa9a3d4eb9c","content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"Malone University","type":"College","url":"malone-university"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.7281},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":20785},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"830-1060"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Sophomore","body":"I decided to attend Malone all the way from Southern California and, while a crazy decision, I would not have chosen any other school.
