This school has everything you need and is covered in your tuition. Before college I was looking for a diverse and aesthetically pleasing campus, and this gave me all of this and more. Northridge has one the  best art school in the country. They offer several free tutoring, therapist, doctors, and more. The professors have great credentials and want the best for your learning experience, one just needs to look at their background prior to the class. They do not have the best sport team but this an easy fix to their overall performance. They have a high-tech gym that offer numerous classes, equipment, and facilities. The party scene is great. It is not too much or less but the right amount.

I am going into teaching to expose future generations to this style of learning and engagement. I am current in the single subject teaching program, and wish they would offer a credential program that in blended with a master's program in education. A huge disappointment, since a lot of universities do offer such programs.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2017-08-10T03:48:37.714462Z","guid":"88fe80ef-13e4-4c72-80a0-6dacddcad432","rating":4},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":3}],"photos":{"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-117.819019,34.054273,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-117.819019,34.054273,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.547645125958379,"count":2739},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Pomona, CA"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/california-state-polytechnic-university---pomona/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"9467bfec-0869-4392-9d54-e7d92598d377","badge":{"display":"Best Colleges in America","ordinal":500,"total":1644,"vanityURL":"best-colleges"},"content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"La Salle University","type":"College","url":"la-salle-university"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.7684},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":26772},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"870-1080"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Alum","body":"Overall, I was grateful for the experience La Salle gave me during my undergraduate degree. I met amazing people and learned from brilliant professors. I got the one on one attention I needed from faculty due to the overall size of the school. I also was able to join a sorority and other clubs La Salle had to offer. I met life long friends and remained in touch with not only students but some professors as well. Only reason I did not give 5 stars was because the school was very expensive when I attended, (graduated May 2016) and I am in a ton of student debt because of it.

I find that CSULA is very safety-conscious, maintains an excellent campus environment and student life, and hires very impressive and motivated professors who instill knowledge and their own passions into the students they teach. However, if there are two aspects that I would like to see CSULA improve on, they would be the local area and campus food. I would appreciate it if there were interesting activities to participate in in the local area and if there was a much bigger variety of healthy food choices aside from the food trucks and the food court.

The professors I've had have been great and I've taken away valuable information from their classes and applied that information to my everyday life. One thing I do wish was different would be the amount of students that are accepted. With so many students here, it's very difficult to get into the classes necessary to graduate. There are a lot of impacted majors, but that is because the programs Sac State offers have to be some of the best in the country; so, it's understandable.

The library has resources from state of the art equipment, macs and PCs, digital media equipment with green screens, quiet study floors, a Starbucks, tutoring center, a writing center and so many more things. Central campus is very pretty and very green, with the MLK plaza in the middle and trees perfectly lined up.

The university has the highest number of students enrolled ever this year.  The campus is centrally located to multiple apartment buildings and restaurants.  The campus holds multiple job fairs, opportunity fairs, career progression panels, and other such organizations are well known to the community.  The welcoming to freshmen, involvement, and connection building is very prominent, including sororities and fraternities, but also with sports, ROTC programs, and other events.

The weather is wonderful; we have all four seasons. Flagstaff is especially great if you enjoy the outdoors since we're close to the Grand Canyon and other national parks. The instructors are wonderful (that I've had) and they take the time to get to know their students. Academically, if you take the time to study and communicate with your instructors then it's not too difficult. There are also a lot of academic resources (for free) that NAU provides for their students to succeed in their classes. Overall, NAU is a solid university to attend and I'm glad that I picked it.

As the flagship campus of the Umass system, it stands as a growing research institution for all of STEM as well as the liberal arts. Along with the amazing faculty in my department the microbiology curriculum is in my opinion one of the best in New England. As an active member of the student body, I never felt like I was alone on campus and was able to be myself on campus. I enjoyed 4+ years at the university and I will always look back fondly on both the memories and friendships I have made while I was a Minute Man.

The professors here are okay, the reason why is they are very close-minded and authoritative. You cannot question their judgment, and they are not open to new ideas. The campus buildings and dorms are kept clean and updated - which is a huge plus to recompense their weaknesses. The student life here is dull since most people are commuters and the students only hang around with people from their high school. The food here is from good to average in some days. Finally, the academics here is excellent since it has tons of academic variations along with professors that are passionate about their specialized field.
