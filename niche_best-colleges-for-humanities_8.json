CCNY have so much to offer to their students. There are over 100 student clubs, an extensive list of majors and minors to choose from. There are plenty of programs that are there to help if you are struggling outside and inside of the school. There are also rewards for students who maintain a GPA of 3.0 and above as well as programs that recognizes students who are not quite at the 3.0 mark bug still shows their ambition to succeed. I think the best part was getting first pick in registration because I am registered with the accessibility center.

In class, the learning style is so different from anything I had ever seen because we are taught to learn from other people's experiences and by engaging in conversations. Here, we aspire to be very politically and socially aware of different issues going around the world. There are organizations directed to many communities and they are really welcoming. Outside the classroom, those organizations could potentially become your family. The great thing about The New School is that it is very respectful of individuality. If you are a very \"on you own\" person that is respected but if you love being with people and socializing all the time you can find your space too.

I was actually faced with the opportunity to transfer to another school that would be closer to home, but I just couldn't bring myself to doing it because this school did not compare to Andrews. \nAnother thing about Andrews is that it is very diverse--that is one of the major things that I enjoy the most. I have many friends from the united states, Brazil, Rwanda, Kenya, China, Russia and many other people.

Despite the high acceptance rate, the academics are challenging yet interesting, and therefore worthwhile.

I decided to come to this school because of it's beautiful campus and because it is a good school in a prime location for my major (marine biology).  The campus is unlike any I've seen before; you practically forget that you're walking around a college campus because you get so immersed in the beautiful scenic redwood forest around you.  UCSC is also very close to the ocean, making it a great location for those who love to frequent the beach.  Aside from location, I have had great experiences academically with this school.  All of my professors have been extremely kind and genuinely interested in the wellbeing and learning process of their students.  Finally, UCSC is a school that is extremely accepting of people from all different backgrounds, sexual orientations, and cultures and strives to make all students feel welcome.

NNU has 4 main values: Transformation, Truth, Community, and Service.\n\nAlongside that, NNU has an amazing community surrounded by individuals who invest in others. NNU welcomes every one. Class sizes at NNU are small, which enables professors to instill personal time into every student. NNU also puts on weekly, fun and exciting events for students to connect deeper with one another. \n\nI would highly recommend NNU to anyone!","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2017-05-07T21:52:33.442459Z","guid":"36e51e85-f831-4576-ba70-a2a902dd9b40","rating":5},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":3.33}],"photos":{"default":{"crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/c2b5c84fc1b186143eec1e4182d5b6c29c42e2a1.jpg","MobileHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/cc8f89e695b62d60a203c95abd6e047b3d38eaaa.jpg"},"licenseName":"UNLICENSED"},"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-116.564792,43.563181,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-116.564792,43.563181,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.960294117647059,"count":680},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Nampa, ID"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/northwest-nazarene-university/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"6a5cf44c-66b9-4e92-aa9e-7899dfc37298","badge":{"display":"Best Colleges in America","ordinal":428,"total":1644,"vanityURL":"best-colleges"},"content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":true,"isPremium":true,"name":"CUNY Queens College","type":"College","url":"cuny-queens-college"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.4134},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":8704},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"1000-1180"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Junior","body":"Queens College has a very diverse campus.
