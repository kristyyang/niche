I just completed my Freshman year and it was better than I expected. All of my professors were very helpful in teaching and guide myself as well as other students. The facilities were up to date and if renovations were needed, it would be taken care of with no hastle. The campus life was always buzzing with free lunch socials, carnivals in the campus park, guest speakers, and other activities to allow students to become more engaged as well as prepare for future plans. I never encountered a problem regarding a safety issue or complained about a professor’s approach to a topic. I would highly reccomend ULM to anyone and everyone considering a 4-year university!","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2018-05-23T00:40:20.803639Z","guid":"352b9855-a5e8-4a9d-9925-a2d98d9f81e9","rating":5},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":3}],"photos":{"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-92.073855,32.527957,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-92.073855,32.527957,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.5638629283489096,"count":642},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Monroe, LA"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/university-of-louisiana---monroe/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"96bd5c4f-43dc-4ffd-967c-043ccc8d0169","content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"Central Washington University","type":"College","url":"central-washington-university"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.7971},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":14080},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"960-1150"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Freshman","body":"What I loved about Central Washington University the most is that our campus is very focused on making Central feel like home and that everybody deserves to be treated with the same respect despite color, creed, religion or sexual orientation.

From the green trees that stretch to the rolling hills all summer long to the snow that makes the college look like it's something out of hogwarts. This college is ideal for people who prefer to have a close relationship with both the student body and the professors. Plenty of opportunity is presented for the students to be involved during the school year along with priming the seniors who will graduate jobs and connections for careers. The convenience of a 10 min walk max to whatever you need on campus is great! If you are an introvert who prefers to spend long intimate nights with Netflix, you can do that here. I would highly not recommend it because the thing about this college is that we are family here, you'll be surrounded by quality friends whom you can create the best of memories with if you choose to be involved with them.

The faculty are extremely helpful. The school has a lot to offer living on campus and even off campus. The places to eat at are fun, as well as the other activities that you can be involved in the recreation area and the gym. The library is very large and accommodating for all needs whether using the computers, internet usage, or the study rooms for group assignments. The library and the student recreation areas are open until 12am. I am very lucky to be attending such a school that knows what students need to be successful. The career center is another place where students can get help putting together resumes, and getting jobs. It provides a full service help center for new, transfer, or current students. I just can't say enough about them!

I love the flexibility of scheduling class times and days, and the help available for students to succeed. One thing that needs to change desperately is the parking available to students. I do not think that students should only be allowed to park in certain colored parking lots. It is a huge hassle to try and find a parking spot and get to class on time. Especially when you cant afford a ticket that is given when parked in the wrong color.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2017-05-13T16:37:11.51044Z","guid":"0c80de63-6bb1-4e40-9dc8-424cd50c26c6","rating":5},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":3}],"photos":{"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-93.13233,35.295227,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-93.13233,35.295227,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.705508474576271,"count":944},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Russellville, AR"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/arkansas-tech-university/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"414813f0-dfa1-4600-857e-b2bc99c8098a","content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"La Roche College","type":"College","url":"la-roche-college"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.9227},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":22426},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"810-1020"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Junior","body":"La Roche may seem like a tiny dot on a map to some, but La Roche college has so many things to offer to students and I am proud to be a part of it!

Campus is very much together; you could walk to all of your classes. There's a shuttle bus that runs every 15-20 minutes that will take you around campus when you're feeling lazy or the weather is bad. The faculty members I've experienced the past 3 years I've been there have been AMAZING. I've met the most knowledgeable individuals at the Psychology Department.

Smith University has given me an experience I would never forget. Being from a poor family as well as neighborhood once gave me the impression that I would not leave that situation. Battling depression and other feelings were indescribable as far as words go. I visited JCSU during my preteen years and could only dream of a chance to enroll. Well, 2017 I was accepted and experienced college at 27 years old. That was the most exhilarating, unbelievable, phenomenal moment in my life. I strongly recommend JCSU to anyone looking to make a change for themselves or study in a pleasant environment.JCSU saved my life.

There was a sense of unity and excitement that I think is crucial to embracing the college experience. In just a short amount of time I have already excelled in academics and have taken several learning opportunities in and outside of the classroom.
