They work make students more involved throughout campus. The campus is very beautiful and it is such a big school, there is a place for everyone. I am not too happy about the way we register for classes because they do not anticipate for the amount of students who plan to register for a specific class and not everyone can register for the class that semester. It is solely based on luck if you hit the button to register on time before someone else. But all in all, I am happy I chose West Virginia because it gave me a chance to learn how to be more independent and prove to myself and others I can be successful.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2018-01-06T11:56:16.127514Z","guid":"b884f60e-dadd-42d3-8131-e64974216376","rating":4},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":2.33}],"photos":{"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-81.76802,38.379002,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-81.76802,38.379002,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.4356435643564356,"count":303},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Institute, WV"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/west-virginia-state-university/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"6914a222-c39a-473e-bcba-9b4f18457381","content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"Bloomfield College","type":"College","url":"bloomfield-college"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.6158},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":18718},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"770-950"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Freshman","body":"At first, I was a bit nervous coming all the way to Bloomfield from Camden.

There are always opportunities to get involved and get active on campus. If you show effort, the teachers will meet you half way. They are very willing and open to assistance. My academic adviser is the absolute best. I am comfortable going to see her about anything whether it is school related or not. I was proactive about scheduling so for me, it was easy to get the classes I wanted at the times I wanted. However, they have yet to begin online registration methods but word around is that we should have it for next fall. One set back is that the business office and financial aid offices are not very efficient and are not always on the same page. I had to keep going back and talking with both of them to get one simple thing done that turned out to be a slack on their part. Also, there seems to be some unnecessary general education classes, but that is expected being though that this is a Christian, private school. Other than that I have had a fine time here. I like the small campus and class setting, so this was a good pick for me.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2016-02-09T01:02:59Z","guid":"c5013cc6-c0dd-458c-9831-6d438a8e25a3","rating":4},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":2}],"photos":{"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-77.774231,36.017443,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-77.774231,36.017443,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.450980392156863,"count":204},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Rocky Mount, NC"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/north-carolina-wesleyan-college/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"129bd00f-1fe2-4789-b1ab-0043cf7a6f9b","content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"Faulkner University","type":"College","url":"faulkner-university"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.4538},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":19877},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"880-1120"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Sophomore","body":"Faulkner University is a Christian based school where Christianity is exemplified in the character of their professors and staff.

I believe that Faulkner looks out for the best interest of its students, helping them to succeed and meet their potential goals in life.

The campus is very laid back and the distractions are very minimal. I love the dorms because you have the option of having a single or double room as well as the apartment style. I feel like I am at home here. The only thing that I would change about USC-Beaufort is the amount of activities available on campus and more available majors and minors. Other than that I enjoy living on this campus and going to school here. I highly recommend this college to those seeking a small class size, professors willing to work with you, and awesome dorms!

The staff is amazing they welcome students with smiles and they are always ready to assist when they are needed .The advisors make sure students keep on task and they always encourage students to be the best .  The teachers are the best. They don't only teach but they show you how to use what they teach in real life situations. Although the teachers may also be strict they try their best to make lectures, labs & etc fun. UVI is also filled with opportunities. UVI has work studies & they have so much programs that can help students be the best at what they want to be. My only complaint is that they don't have much activities for students.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2018-01-29T15:21:45.534153Z","guid":"d196d0a4-fb64-41f7-a88a-3165d552ca91","rating":4},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade"}],"photos":{"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-64.972866,18.344193,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-64.972866,18.344193,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.368995633187773,"count":458},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Charlotte Amalie, VI"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/university-of-the-virgin-islands/#scatterplot"}}]}
