Professors are great and willing to work with students during many times of the day, which also goes for the kitchen staff and the admissions office! The dorms are great and super cozy for a college! I miss spending time in the dorm buildings so much! I would do anything to put myself back there with the same group of people for one more night!

I rarely see an unfamiliar face.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2015-12-29T20:44:31Z","guid":"ecb63ffe-473c-4ff0-8eac-b93a3945a3b1","rating":4},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":2.66}],"photos":{"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-91.628115,35.778934,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-91.628115,35.778934,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.510204081632653,"count":245},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Batesville, AR"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/lyon-college/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"1c163dff-481e-4333-8cff-08e7992e4952","content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"Wilberforce University","type":"College","url":"wilberforce-university"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.3841},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":17678},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"710-960"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Senior","body":"Wilberforce University has made me more hungry, and competitive than ever before!
