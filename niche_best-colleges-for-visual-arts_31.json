They were all pretty friendly and helpful. All but the computer professor (of course) have a strong objection to electronics in the classroom, though, which I thought was a bit odd. I understand prohibiting cell phones in class. I do not understand prohibiting tablets or laptops, even if you're using them to take notes. Luckily I have accommodations to take notes electronically--otherwise, I'd be up a certain creek without a paddle. Most high schools use iPads or some other tablet/laptop now, in the classroom, so students coming in are obviously used to that; why prohibit it now? Anyway, the courses I took were great. Their quality was more or less impeccable. Class sizes are GREAT--usually 20-30. As to variety...their catalog says that French and German classes are available, but they're actually not, because they don't have anyone to teach them; as a result, the only available foreign language course is Spanish. I am tired of Spanish being the only language both offered and/or required in all schools, not just college. It's time to break out into other linguistic areas!","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2015-12-29T17:25:23Z","guid":"c3f4f03d-933f-41be-848b-589b4fb4ae81","rating":5},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":2.66}],"photos":{"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-81.970898,34.954585,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-81.970898,34.954585,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.5481927710843375,"count":166},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"2 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Spartanburg, SC"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/spartanburg-methodist-college/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"525c72f3-2373-420a-a7e5-c48d9086e0ae","content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":true,"isPremium":false,"name":"Brevard College","type":"College","url":"brevard-college"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.4216},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":20864},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"850-1050"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Freshman","body":"My time at Brevard has been filled with new friends, caring professors, and a wonderful education.

It was an amazing experience at the University because of the diversity of students, the campus beauty and the overall Downeast Maine atmosphere. Here I sit today going back to the University of Maine at Machias in my early 40's. I decided to change my major and return to school. I am an online student now, however I stay connected in various ways through the school. What I find the most appealing that even after all these years, the same professors are still working at the college. The school has a home like feel because of the atmosphere the campus offers. I highly recommend the University of Maine at Machias if you enjoy the outdoors, especially oceans. There may not be a lot of things to do in town because it is very rural. However, there is an abundance of outdoor activities that will be a once in a lifetime experience.

I enjoyed smaller class sizes, was less than 10 students for some of my own. This offers more time for discussions and one on ones with the teacher. Personally, I would've liked to see greater diversity among SFAI's student body! This school is easily one of the most relaxed academic settings I've been in. Faculty at SFAI stress the importance of healthy mental and emotional health and does a great job promoting their resources for students.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2018-03-22T04:07:40.037686Z","guid":"2c29f006-6c87-4da4-845c-cf101faca88d","rating":4},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":2.33}],"photos":{"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-122.417,37.803575,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-122.417,37.803575,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.506666666666667,"count":150},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"San Francisco, CA"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/san-francisco-art-institute/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"322dddec-dbd5-4fcf-a838-559be944d2f8","content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"Watkins College of Art, Design, & Film","type":"College","url":"watkins-college-of-art-design--and--film"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.97},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":28067},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"890-1165"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Junior","body":"If you want to school that is very Arts Center and encouraging of people's talents and abilities, then you should definitely come here.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2018-01-25T22:46:55.587032Z","guid":"eac0a730-1991-4ffa-b554-26c296f4b46d","rating":4},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":2.66}],"photos":{"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-86.805888,36.194659,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-86.805888,36.194659,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.532608695652174,"count":92},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Nashville, TN"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/watkins-college-of-art-design--and--film/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"e53ed1c3-a7cc-4cc6-ade4-3b953fca8324","content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"Hussian College","type":"College","url":"hussian-college"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.7857},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":20043},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"830-1100"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Freshman","body":"My daughter is a college freshman at the Relativity branch campus in Los Angeles, CA and absolutely loves it!
