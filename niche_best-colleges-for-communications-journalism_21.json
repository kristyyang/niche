If there anything I would want to change, I would love to see more sports teams at Robert Morris University. It's a funding reason no doubt, but there are more women teams than men teams, so it would be nice to see a change there.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2018-06-02T00:53:01.828374Z","guid":"5a56cff3-ae82-4ddc-a147-9a06058f2b67","rating":5},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":2.66}],"photos":{"default":{"crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/fb3102a503fa8291aee9cf38ddd406122ee56005.jpg","MobileHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/06b4f6310cdeb1f0f889aabc1d39ff0145c923e5.jpg"},"licenseName":"UNLICENSED"},"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-80.211785,40.521088,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-80.211785,40.521088,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.4782168186423505,"count":987},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Moon Township, PA"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/robert-morris-university---pennsylvania/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"ea5e4aaf-7154-4bca-8344-2b4e8be7b0c0","content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":true,"isPremium":false,"name":"Caldwell University","type":"College","url":"caldwell-university"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.8541},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":19041},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"850-1070"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Niche User","body":"It was great!

I have yet to take a class with a professor who does not know my name within the first two weeks of school. The class sizes are small, anywhere from 5-35 students, which allows for a very personalized classroom experience. You are not just a \"number\" to your professor like you would be at a bigger school, and this leads you to have great relationships with your professors and peers alike. \nIn addition, this college has truly allowed me to broaden my horizons more than I ever thought possible. When I came here, I was incredibly shy, but my professors and peers encouraged me to step out of my comfort zone. This led me to join various organizations, take challenging classes, and even go to London for a study abroad trip. \nThis school is amazing and has offered me endless opportunities.

Professors are intelligent, funny, and made learning feel less like work. Definitely recommend the senior capstone project required by several majors because it gives you the research and writing skills needed to do a master's thesis project closely supervised by faculty.\n\nStudent body is quiet but has a lot of neat interests and passions.

The campus is beautiful, and if you make friends easily like me, you don't have a problem with the commuter culture.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2017-07-25T22:21:25.446621Z","guid":"5447a269-12fd-4ec9-96e8-0f593198b4e5","rating":4},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":2.66}],"photos":{"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-90.502825,38.788203,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-90.502825,38.788203,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.5039893617021276,"count":752},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Saint Charles, MO"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/lindenwood-university/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"416a3f4c-da00-4be0-b68f-bc41d3648601","content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"Columbia College - South Carolina","type":"College","url":"columbia-college---south-carolina"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.8707},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":16583},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"840-1050"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Freshman","body":"I like it here!  The professors are pretty cool. There are students, upperclassmen, that are definitely happy to help you understand. There are a lot of international students, so there's a lot of diversity on campus. The academic scene was good until the school needed to be upgraded, which means there won't be any Spanish or French majors. I'm kinda hoping they don't take music for my friend's sake. The area the college is in is a little sketchy, a bit of an understatement. There were at least 3 emails about guys running from police or something, but the Columbia College Police Department keeps us safe. As for the party scene, you're gonna have to go to University of South Carolina or Five Points. Bring a friend if you're going to Five Points, though. It's not notorious for danger; it's just safer that way, and it was recommended by the people who actually live here. Overall, I'm looking forward to what the next 2.5 years will bring here.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2016-12-13T14:36:06.846356Z","guid":"47d8fba7-ab87-4b22-bd1a-d12685129046","rating":4},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":2.33}],"photos":{"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-81.001369,34.062923,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-81.001369,34.062923,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.5365853658536586,"count":451},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Columbia, SC"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/columbia-college---south-carolina/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"5a7c4edd-4bc3-4f74-bc35-03477c8e0759","content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":true,"isPremium":false,"name":"Millikin University","type":"College","url":"millikin-university"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.638},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":21935},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"910-1080"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Alum","body":"I would not trade my 4 years at MU for anything!

This unviersity has so many opportunities to get involved in or out of campus. For my first year here on campus I met so many great new people that became great friends with me. These friends become like family and people I can count on, they may live far away but they are still great and stay in contact with you. This campus also has many opportunities to get to know your professors, advisors, and mentors. The University of Southern Indiana brought me not only great friends but amazing group orgianzations to be involved with also, I am currently apart of the Student Ambassadors that give tours of the campus and not only that but for next year I am not your Emerging Leaders Mentor Leader. This places has so many great opportunities that look outstanding on resumes when you go to apply for a job in the future. It is small but a safe campus that makes you feel at home.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2018-05-24T19:41:51.065033Z","guid":"de6d79e5-f0aa-4234-ac56-eaaa0751d1e7","rating":5},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":3}],"photos":{"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-87.67666,37.966188,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-87.67666,37.966188,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.65807962529274,"count":854},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Evansville, IN"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/university-of-southern-indiana/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"f17288c0-fbf3-467a-aedf-564e38d44608","content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":true,"isPremium":false,"name":"Cabrini University","type":"College","url":"cabrini-university"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.7106},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":24958},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"880-1050"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Junior","body":"My overall experience at Cabrini University has been good so far. I am currently a junior on the women's soccer team and women's crew team. During my time at Cabrini I have met a bunch of different people who are all so nice. Cabrini is not a big campus, but once you find a good group of people to hangout with it will change your experience at Cabrini. One of the biggest things that I think Cabrini needs to change is the size of the campus. Yes I understand that it is easier said than done. But if Cabrini added more residence halls or a bigger parking lot for students, many of the current students would be happier and wouldn't have a lot of problems","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2018-01-03T20:16:55.70906Z","guid":"d92b87f8-c35f-42a9-b230-f4e36610f4ff","rating":4},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":2.66}],"photos":{"default":{"crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/2b4e82ff712da58023b54cbc03739cee886cf63f.jpg","MobileHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/d7dfab9b31bcdeb4a11ddf73491cb23fda1c943a.jpg"},"licenseName":"UNLICENSED"},"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-75.37215,40.054565,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-75.37215,40.054565,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.3230769230769233,"count":325},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Radnor, PA"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/cabrini-university/#scatterplot"}}]}
