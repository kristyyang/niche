Whether that’s through freshman activities, great professors, or just awesome, nice people, Concordia is extremely welcoming to everyone and anyone. Oh and I can’t forget to mention how awesome free parking at the university is! \nI would, however, change the policies pertaining to the hours that boys/girls can be in each other’s dorms. I think that this policy should be different because by the time we get to college, we are adults. We should be capable of making our own mature decisions pertaining to the opposite gender. \nThe smallness of Concordia is one of its positives and negatives. It is a good thing because of how easy it is to know your fellow students, athletes, faculty, and even the president of the university.

If any one person has an issue everyone around is concerned for that individual and will help any way they can. I have personally experienced this during a crisis in my life. This college definitely impacted my life in the best possible way. 10 out of 10 would rate again.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2017-02-10T00:09:38.135929Z","guid":"e0902bfa-7285-4865-a230-592a39767d77","rating":5},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":3}],"photos":{"default":{"crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/ef4630c7161dd166338ee78f23ce42855b25aaed.jpg","MobileHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/36b9711d0348e71cd400839d5edc1a0e61670a87.jpg"},"licenseName":"UNLICENSED"},"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-85.499624,40.89907,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-85.499624,40.89907,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.6198347107438016,"count":363},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Huntington, IN"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/huntington-university/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"114ecb3a-6ca2-470b-8221-65f1bf0dfbd9","content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"University of Nevada - Las Vegas","type":"College","url":"university-of-nevada---las-vegas"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.8278},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":11432},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"900-1130"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Junior","body":"I am about to start in my third year at UNIV and so far my experience in and outside of the classroom have been amazing!

I'm a really extraverted person, so being able to make lots of connections and build relationships is something I find a lot of enjoyment in. However, I will say one of WSU's greatest downfalls is the use of Graduate Teaching Assistants (GTA) to teach an entire class. I know they'll have to one day teach a class, but a lot of the GTAs seem a little unprepared for it. Also, off the GTAs I have, some of them have even taught lecture for twenty minutes and let students go. Professors can take up the full hour with one lecture, so GTAs should be held to the same standard. In all honesty, this is just a small problem I have with WSU so far, so I hope it will change as I go forward in my degree program!","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2017-11-03T22:54:13.895863Z","guid":"3d22924d-21f9-46d1-8e96-5bad0f6904f9","rating":4},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":2.66}],"photos":{"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-97.296733,37.716484,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-97.296733,37.716484,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.586053412462908,"count":1348},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Wichita, KS"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/wichita-state-university/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"b84535ba-be32-4f39-acdd-4511bc675a24","content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"Westfield State University","type":"College","url":"westfield-state-university"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.7792},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":15593},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"890-1090"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Sophomore","body":"It's been very fun here meeting all the friends I have made and bring part of the track and field team as a thrower.

During my time I have attended numerous student life events and the students are awesome.  As far as academics go, the school offers many opportunities to choose from so I’m sure incoming students will feel at home. Moreover, the professors are friendly and really want you to succeed, so if you’re the type that worries about not having individual attention, no need to worry here because the class ratio is perfect for that matter.

There are a number of housing options once you decide you're done with dorm life, including many homes for rent in the area. I like that we are taught by the professors and not aides. I appreciate that we don't have to be entered onto a waiting list for entry into specialized studies pertaining to our majors. I do feel that Whitewater athletics should be recognized more statewide, as we have some of the best athletes/teams around! The student enrollment is diverse, allowing interactions with people not only from around the US but the world! And tuition is more affordable than some of the other state universities, yet we get the same (or better) educational offerings.

There are also plenty of activities for students to participate in, as well as a concert venue on campus (H Ric Luhrs PAC) which provides great entertainment year round.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2018-01-08T21:05:07.836006Z","guid":"3c5f86b5-c265-4101-9909-fe69bc7389a6","rating":4},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":2.66}],"photos":{"default":{"crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/c02dca423f37be5f20b33b8932fb9fa3d002e62f.jpg","MobileHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/a0f089286dcd71d0dcbdcfccb6970f17b48415a9.jpg"},"licenseName":"UNLICENSED"},"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-77.5229,40.057405,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-77.5229,40.057405,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.4408602150537635,"count":930},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Shippensburg, PA"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/shippensburg-university-of-pennsylvania/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"043e56ee-4b71-4f07-9d82-ceec0a7bfcb0","content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"Culver-Stockton College","type":"College","url":"culver-stockton-college"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.5812},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":19747},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"850-1000"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Niche User","body":"I am planning to enroll at Culver-Stockton College in Fall 2018 and I have only had positive experiences with it so far!

The people and staff are welcoming, helpful, and hard working. The campus is comforting with its acres of woods surrounding it, and safe. Having various clubs and activities going on around campus, there is no excuse for having nothing to do. The services offered here are great, ranging from career assistance, tutoring, to health and fitness. My favorite part about the campus, and also the first thing I noticed was the many critters running around. We are accompanied by cute squirrels, chipmunks, birds, etc. If you are trying to get away from the city and home, the Johnstown campus is the perfect fit. Pitt Johnstown is a great place to start making memories and building your future!","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2018-05-19T17:47:00.852107Z","guid":"7c1964e6-c4e2-495f-95ac-ce3412eb52e9","rating":4},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":2.66}],"photos":{"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-78.832611,40.268583,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-78.832611,40.268583,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.2945590994371483,"count":533},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Johnstown, PA"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/university-of-pittsburgh---johnstown/#scatterplot"}}]}
