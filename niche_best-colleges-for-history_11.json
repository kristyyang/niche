The students are academically motivated and are always able to manage their school with friends and family. It is a University that is small, but can offer so many opportunities for students who are motivated to see what the collegiate experience can offer. Overall, the University provides an ideal situation for those who are not aiming for a large campus or large school. Buildings are no more than 10 minutes away from one another and the chances of bumping into someone you know is very high. Students tend to be interactive when walking to classes and it is just a healthy environment for students who are wanting to get to know others in their major and in the dorms and all over campus. I highly recommend Truman State University and any student can get the most from attending this University!","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2017-12-25T23:54:06.166669Z","guid":"0c4f1394-60a3-4560-bd87-fc7d9d5a1f64","rating":5},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":3.66}],"photos":{"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-92.580531,40.188238,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-92.580531,40.188238,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.5279831045406547,"count":947},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Kirksville, MO"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/truman-state-university/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"909c77eb-776f-417e-9230-6919ab231a2b","badge":{"display":"Best Colleges for History in America","ordinal":264,"total":640,"vanityURL":"best-colleges-for-history"},"content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"University of South Florida","type":"College","url":"university-of-south-florida"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.4663},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":11398},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"1070-1250"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Sophomore","body":"USF has surpassed any expectations I ever had on what life would be at college.  Being a relatively new university there is a lot of pride and youthful energy in the professors, administration, and students. The MSC is a great student hub with a good food court, a restaurant, 4 floors of study or “chilling” areas, offices, event rooms, a theater, a ballroom, a pharmacy, a computer store and many more things. The library has resources from state of the art equipment, macs and PCs, digital media equipment with green screens, quiet study floors, a Starbucks, tutoring center, a writing center and so many more things. Central campus is very pretty and very green, with the MLK plaza in the middle and trees perfectly lined up. The athletics are great including the 3 gyms which include an indoor and an outdoor swimming pools, dance studio, wrestling room, cardio floor, weight floor, indoor track, volleyball, basketball and racquetball courts. We bleed green with a heart of gold.

Overall, a wonderful experience thus far.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2018-01-23T22:03:00.545566Z","guid":"d72ea003-2aad-44f7-99ed-5f7deffdf7ff","rating":5},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":3.33}],"photos":{"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-122.445372,47.145494,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-122.445372,47.145494,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.5839243498817965,"count":846},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Tacoma, WA"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/pacific-lutheran-university/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"1dea6507-ce60-40bb-99c7-05b4140d7ce1","content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":true,"isPremium":true,"name":"Southern New Hampshire University","type":"College","url":"southern-new-hampshire-university"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.84},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":34984},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"870-1060"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Sophomore","body":"Everyone you deal with is so nice and helpful!

Prior to coming here, I was highly indecisive between Mississippi State and Ole Miss. After my first visit to MSU, I was completely in love with the academics, campus, and town! I will forever be a huge proponent for MSU, and everything that it has have to offer. MSU has offered me so much just in the two semesters I have been here. I am majoring in Kinesiology, and every single of one the professors in this department are so helpful, and truly want to watch each student succeed. The professors in this department are particularly wonderful in assisting their students to get into grad school. Additionally, I have had a number of ways to get involved and volunteer for different organizations. I love seeing the diversity here at MSU, and at the same time realizing that we are all here for one goal, and that is being taught to be well-rounded professionals for “the real world”.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2018-04-13T19:30:25.532473Z","guid":"89d45621-9f52-41bc-b46c-9c9bee3a797c","rating":5},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":4}],"photos":{"default":{"crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/c0937e3ef5ea37e17fe1c8fe728abe009ee6ecc4.jpg","MobileHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/f5136c486c1d7aee0938da37d874c8f2c90d108e.jpg","Thumbnail":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/ade2bf07163c70dccd621ad6a5ced5dd4ff0ce24"},"licenseName":"UNLICENSED"},"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-88.78834,33.455241,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-88.78834,33.455241,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.843767011431682,"count":1837},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Mississippi State, MS"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/mississippi-state-university/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"16e73fef-82a8-4fe4-ae06-3f1392e31d63","content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":true,"isPremium":true,"name":"Binghamton University, SUNY","type":"College","url":"binghamton-university-suny"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.4062},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":16540},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"1230-1400"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Junior","body":"I really like Binghamton but there is room for improvement. As a psychology major it is hard to get into classes you need as they close out, even if you came in with a ton of AP credits. Also, so many classes are big so its harder to focus and do well in them. The campus is hilly. Academics are great, i’ve only had one bad teacher. Advising sucks I had to figure everything out on my own. Mountainview dorms were awfull, invisible RA, no community events, unfriendly people etc. Now I live in Newing and I love it and it’s so much better! Many Long Island students, intentational students (mostly from Asia) and Jewish students. You have to find your people at this school but once you do your experience can be great. Also, we don’t have certain majors like education (also communications, and others people complain about) which really sucks but they try to sell you on their grad program. The food is hit or miss, definitely go to the Kosher station since they have the best food.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2018-05-23T01:30:53.174035Z","guid":"98f168b2-72e9-48d0-bb5e-1cc0fdef30f8","rating":4},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":3.66}],"photos":{"default":{"crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/843cc93be5f59a4bf97adb882d92fccaf932660b.jpg","MobileHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/e1bba7684cb59ca91b80ae5381f80c29566dec0c.jpg"},"licenseName":"UNLICENSED"},"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-75.971143,42.088049,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-75.971143,42.088049,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.5464154411764706,"count":2176},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Vestal, NY"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/binghamton-university-suny/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"d4afc202-a90c-4cb9-9c9f-f7d0e9db2743","content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"Auburn University","type":"College","url":"auburn-university"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.8054},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":21698},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"1060-1260"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Junior","body":"I adore the sense of family here!

I refused to research the school because I did not believe Winthrop was the place for me; however,  I toured the campus about three years later.  One reason why is because of the campus's size. In my opinion, Winthrop is a smaller Clemson. Furthermore, the student ratio is 15:1. Another reason is the convivial atmosphere. Winthrop's faculties are organized, easy to find, and productive. For example, the student center has over four different restaurants and the workers are nice. The staff occupying these places such as the recreation center, bookstore, and admissions office are welcoming, helpful, and friendly. Last but not least, Winthrop has the graphic design program which is my intended major. Thus, I have been accepted into Winthrop University and I am looking forward to finish in two years. I love Winthrop.

I am absolutely in love with the campus and overall atmosphere of the school. I was worried about the size at first (it is quite small), but after attending my first semester I enjoy the fact that it allows for a more community-like experience. Everyone is so kind and welcoming. I also feel secure yet free. The food at the CI is amazing, there are so much options to choose from. I loved all my professors and classes so far. Also, uptown Whittier it just a close walk! It’s my favorite place to just Rome around when I’m bored!","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2018-01-30T03:57:40.232099Z","guid":"ff684e8b-9872-4132-bbdd-ddd8ba14bc9e","rating":4},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":3.33}],"photos":{"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-118.028402,33.977625,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-118.028402,33.977625,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.4869565217391303,"count":690},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Whittier, CA"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/whittier-college/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"d0af3509-721d-4570-b400-a65f59e2bae8","content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"SUNY Plattsburgh","type":"College","url":"suny-plattsburgh"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.5103},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":14287},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"990-1210"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Sophomore","body":"There are so many opportunities at this college to get involved! So many clubs, activities, research opportunities, etc. I have been inspired by great professors to reach my academic potential and to step out of my comfort zone. Plattsburgh is also a beautiful location. 1 hour from Burlington Vermont, 1 hour from the Adirondack high peak region, and 1 hour from Montreal, and 10 minutes from the beach! Plattsburgh has lots of hiking trails on campus, a river, and a bike path on campus. Also, the dining halls are great. There is an organic Dining hall with a killer salad bar. There are plenty of options all around campus even for people who are vegan or gluten free.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2018-01-04T18:05:31.645922Z","guid":"75dbd13a-b2cb-48d5-9a39-bdfc151c0ea1","rating":5},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":3}],"photos":{"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-73.467342,44.691103,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-73.467342,44.691103,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.526315789473684,"count":665},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Plattsburgh, NY"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/suny-plattsburgh/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"77f3ef9e-4774-4a7a-a34d-46371aca7815","content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":true,"isPremium":false,"name":"Hofstra University","type":"College","url":"hofstra-university"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.6222},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":32169},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"1070-1260"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Freshman","body":"My experience at Hofstra University was great! I will be an incoming freshman this fall and while I was at orientation I noticed a lot of awesome things. First off, the professors and faculty members at Hofstra are there to make sure you're at your best 24/7. There's so many places to go to receive help, it's very reassuring especially when you're having a bad day. Next, the campus and the dorms are nice. The campus is very large which means a lot of walking, but it's not that bad because there's such beautiful architecture and landscaping to look at. The dorms are small and neat, but there's air conditioning which is a major plus. I got to sit through a real college class, which at Hofstra are relatively small. The food at Hofstra has a pretty good selection, but nothing crazy. There are Starbucks, Dunkin Donuts, Subways, Sbarros, and many other places to grab a bite to eat. Overall, Hofstra has a lot to offer and I couldn't be more excited to start my 4-year journey there!","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2017-08-17T13:19:43.218362Z","guid":"0f59bdeb-af97-4200-988e-1f0722fbf2d9","rating":4},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":3.33}],"photos":{"default":{"crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/2fb77d3e7ebcda2dfc09ad08572622874a2ade97.jpg","MobileHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/667677aae7cb8cd43b8b8fa8cb1993cc9e04e87a.jpg"},"licenseName":"UNLICENSED"},"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-73.60078,40.715959,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-73.60078,40.715959,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.483424047501237,"count":2021},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Hempstead, NY"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/hofstra-university/#scatterplot"}}]}
