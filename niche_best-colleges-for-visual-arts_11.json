Plattsburgh has lots of hiking trails on campus, a river, and a bike path on campus. Also, the dining halls are great. There is an organic Dining hall with a killer salad bar.

Our school is known for its high recommendations for any science majors and math majors. I am a Zoology major and my best part of the university is the class where I go out of school with my class to field trip and identify different invertebrate animals near our shores. It was fun and a good leg work out too! Also, the local areas for food is quite amazing. When needing to eat besides campus food, there is a wide variety of different ethnic food here. What I like to see a change in Humboldt is to give a more housing chances for students that are from far away. More housing in the campus for everyone to be. It is tough to find an apartment or house near the school and have the housing costs to be low, for future students coming from different parts of California or an out of state transfer, they should have the opportunity to have a low-cost housing and a secure home to be in.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2018-06-04T07:47:55.941084Z","guid":"69c3f499-369e-44c2-b940-7c35a6e57796","rating":4},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":3}],"photos":{"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-124.0814,40.8741,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-124.0814,40.8741,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.5448863636363637,"count":1760},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Arcata, CA"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/humboldt-state-university/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"c2731dfa-36e9-438a-b5a1-5b5a783f9140","content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"University of Nebraska - Lincoln","type":"College","url":"university-of-nebraska---lincoln"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.7527},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":16462},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"990-1280"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Alum","body":"Attending UNL was a wonderful experience!

The campus itself is very old, but is newly renovated which gives it that antique feel.  It used to be an all women college, but has recently been opened up to men.  The architecture of the buildings is spectacular, and even more impressive, the school has underground tunnels!  I'm going for nursing, and the program guarantees you're out in four years with a degree which is extremely satisfying.  There are also a lot of hospitals near the campus which makes it super easy to complete my clinicals.  The only problem I have with the overall atmosphere is that it is still a blossoming campus, so it is quite small.  I'm from a small town so I'm familiar with the small-town feel, but it would be nice to be apart of a campus with more students at some point in the future.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2017-01-30T15:38:10.925906Z","guid":"6170eace-605b-49ef-814a-a23e385a18af","rating":4},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":2.66}],"photos":{"default":{"crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/fab1d8508676876a6778f15f5ba87c8d6fa832da.jpg","MobileHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/4ad0c7b5da1160250f3a0006ba1d9c92fc7264c7.jpg"},"licenseName":"UNLICENSED"},"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-90.691512,42.508619,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-90.691512,42.508619,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.592833876221498,"count":307},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Dubuque, IA"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/clarke-university/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"5198060a-40a9-4ead-830a-eed06398709e","content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"Radford University","type":"College","url":"radford-university"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.812},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":14084},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"890-1060"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Freshman","body":"Radford University is the perfect school to help new student embrace their personality and not be afraid to try new things.

Also, sunburns from napping at the beach -because midterms kept you up all night are brutal.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2018-03-26T21:44:12.947746Z","guid":"a9529299-57a2-4154-8912-f019b756e7a9","rating":5},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":3.33}],"photos":{"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-157.816607,21.292648,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-157.816607,21.292648,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.415031115366204,"count":2089},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Honolulu, HI"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/university-of-hawaii-at-manoa/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"86825bfe-4bfd-45f6-992b-af03615faa7b","content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"Southern Illinois University Edwardsville","type":"College","url":"southern-illinois-university-edwardsville"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.893},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":15360},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"898-1063"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Junior","body":"Southern Illinois University Edwardsville provides students with a diverse and inclusive community.

With more than seventy individual majors and the opportunities to earn multiple majors, students definitely have not only variety but choice to maximize the opportunities afforded to them to achieve their dreams.

You will be given discounts at the theater there and coupons for being a student at UCR.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2017-12-09T18:55:37.124305Z","guid":"1f33e0c3-c954-4939-881e-1a61b963d1d0","rating":4},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":3.66}],"photos":{"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-117.331098,33.97588,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-117.331098,33.97588,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.499163599866176,"count":2989},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Riverside, CA"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/university-of-california---riverside/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"be4029b3-01be-4384-b24e-a20bcf1fc4aa","content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":true,"isPremium":false,"name":"University of New Mexico","type":"College","url":"university-of-new-mexico"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.5778},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":11230},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"950-1200"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Freshman","body":"This being my first year attending UNM has made me realized how much I've fallen in love with this campus. Coming to UNM has been an amazing experience because not only have I've met sensational friends but also I've been able to grow as a student. This university has been able to provide helpful resources like CAPS tutoring and awesome organizations to get involved in. I'm currently in the ASUNM Community Experience group, where we've been able to  connect with a diverse amount of people by volunteering and helping out within the university and Albuquerque. Living on campus has also been an incredible experience because of our close net community. Every week there is something to do on campus, especially in the dormitories, like: cuddling a canine, carnivals, free movies and most importantly free food/snacks! Being a part of UNM has given me unforgettable memories, close friends and fun experiences.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2018-04-17T01:21:56.060697Z","guid":"451c1596-1fe1-4cbb-9206-0efc9e28370c","rating":5},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":3}],"photos":{"default":{"crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/24131ce06dea388526bedc6ad307882eb9da3219.jpg","MobileHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/062851d99af8e29d786a585ae1faa1c045b34c54.jpg"},"licenseName":"UNLICENSED"},"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-106.620155,35.083868,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-106.620155,35.083868,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.474596896866444,"count":3287},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Albuquerque, NM"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/university-of-new-mexico/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"2c7eca45-1b78-45d5-9660-3ac871024218","content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"University of Nevada - Reno","type":"College","url":"university-of-nevada---reno"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.8281},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":15022},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"970-1200"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Junior","body":"I absolutely love my university! It is a wonderful place to obtain a higher education, meet new people, and make connections that will last forever. I am most excited about finishing my bachelors, starting research in my area of study, and finding the perfect mentor. The university is always being renovated and they are bringing in local restaurants, which have some of the best food on campus! The campus is a great place to spend your whole day, whether it is spent studying, in class, or meeting with friends and professors. The campus is quite large, so it does take some time to walk from the parking areas to your classes, but there are shuttle buses available!","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2018-01-11T16:33:38.13888Z","guid":"923a0f37-44ba-4625-8584-3d04252a9196","rating":4},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":3.33}],"photos":{"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-119.821651,39.549352,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-119.821651,39.549352,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.621714285714286,"count":3500},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Reno, NV"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/university-of-nevada---reno/#scatterplot"}}]}
