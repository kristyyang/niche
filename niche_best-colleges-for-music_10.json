When I visited for the first time, I fell in love with the atmosphere of the College. I felt welcomed right away and never lost this feeling. Additionally, I loved that the students seemed to really care about their campus and that most students are extremely involved on campus. This was all clear to me during my tour and then when I sat in on a class, I was sold. The professor I had was engaging and made the rather large classroom (by Wooster's standards) seem much more intimate. I remember hearing students talking about the class and other classes before and after the lecture, which made me realize how engaged in academics students here are. Fast forward four years and here I am typing this review as a junior at the College. I am so happy that I chose the College of Wooster and that every good thought I had about the College has been proven right ten-fold since coming here.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2017-09-28T19:14:11.732478Z","guid":"7151ada7-491c-482a-be1f-89289234009d","rating":5},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":4}],"photos":{"default":{"author":"cogdog","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/c7b22f39c24ab144a0e0d2445bc21b28e7c67cf2.jpg","MobileHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/fecf2c4978a9be0483d19ec59e55c5e28fd10796.jpg","Thumbnail":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/e06a3442f84bca7de61c7a2e58f95766e6633c97"},"licenseName":"CC BY ","licenseUrl":"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/2.0/","sourceUrl":"https://www.flickr.com/photos/cogdog/8763606508/"},"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-81.934674,40.81046,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-81.934674,40.81046,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.536326530612245,"count":1225},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Wooster, OH"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/college-of-wooster/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"1d0fb976-abc7-4109-8e0a-4db5d766f8b5","content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"North Park University","type":"College","url":"north-park-university"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.9418},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":20076},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"872-1160"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Sophomore","body":"North Park University is a really great campus to get your college education.

While it has a very rigorous academic program, the school also provides a range of resource to choose from if a student is ever in need of help, both academically and otherwise. Despite being an open campus, as a cis-female individual I still feel reasonably safe. The campus is small and beautiful, with the state capital building just across the street. The student body shares a close-knit bond that is perhaps even more so than larger schools, due to the smaller undergrad population. Professors and staff are generally very open, accepting, and easy to approach without fear of judgement. It is a very expensive education, but the majority of students receive some sort of financial aid or scholarship.

With the small class room sizes, you are able to not develop close relations to your peers, but your professors as well. A professor-student  relationship is crucial not only in the learning process, but even future academic adventures outside of Adrian. The professors are more than willing to sit down with you and break it down, piece by piece. You are not just another nameless face, you are you. Being a liberal arts college, distributions are a requirement. Though they may be an annoyance at first, they become well-rounded student shaping machines. Through these classes, you are able to educate your self of the other perceptions, cultures, and ideas along with the synthesis of your own.

The classes are not bigger than 40 students. This allows professors to get to know their students. If a student is struggling, the professors go out of their way to try to help. I have learned that from experience. \nThe campus is small and easy to navigate. It feels like a community. Everyone knows each other and are friendly. \nThere are lots of clubs and activities to involved with. There seems to be something available for everyone. \nThere are also various opportunities to play a varsity sport or participate in intramural sports. \nThe classes are challenging and push you to think.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2016-12-30T22:11:15.977123Z","guid":"1bd43040-a390-4e63-a0d0-c363bfb2fa6c","rating":5},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":3}],"photos":{"default":{"crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/7339d4a8ac93166e0c31f2ad07c5f8274499863a.jpg","MobileHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/2a9b8969b390a1a7d49f6ab7ed829b24c8c3ba1c.jpg"},"licenseName":"UNLICENSED"},"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-93.563471,41.365503,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-93.563471,41.365503,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.5278688524590165,"count":305},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Indianola, IA"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/simpson-college/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"111d690b-93ae-4577-bfa1-0668bce07e50","content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":true,"isPremium":false,"name":"Cornerstone University","type":"College","url":"cornerstone-university"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.6345},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":19900},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"870-1130"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Freshman","body":"There were so many good things I loved about Cornerstone for just being there one year! CU has a small environment that you see familiar faces daily. I feel the professors really care about me. I know I have created relationships that will last a lifetime. I am excited to build stronger relationships next year. I know my faith has grown so much. Being away from my family and developing what I believe is true for myself has been an awesome journey. I have learned to hear from God more. My year was far from perfect. I would describe my first year at Cornerstone overwhelming. The word overwhelming can be a bad thing but can also be a good thing. I learned to let go of many situations and let God. I learned God can turn any bad situation into a good one to bring Him. I am excited for years to come to learn more in the education setting, athletically, with relationships, and with my faith. I have learned so much so far and cannot wait to learn more.
