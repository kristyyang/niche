Here are they:\n1. My first choice is chemical engineering and I always adored to conduct researches in laboratories. Therefore, when I applied to colleges first of all I looked if they have a good undergraduate research opportunities. In MIT with the help UROP I could start researching even from freshman class.\n2. Its pass no record style of educating freshmen. There is no grading in the first semester. Instead, one gets \"Pass\" or \"Fail\" in his or her transcript. It allows students not to stress too much on grades, but explore the university and majors.\n3. Of course it is the best university in the field of chemical engineering. Top notch professors, smart peers and the best laboratories makes MIT unique.\n4. It's financially available for all international students. MIT's need blind policy makes it affordable for all who want to attend it.\n\nI hope it helps!","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2017-12-28T19:46:12.988166Z","guid":"6a2f1b8a-1afe-4ef8-944b-b2dd08d2ab87","rating":5},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":4.33}],"photos":{"default":{"author":"justinjensen","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/9e4d828e5f5cfe5eac16bdee876a58919082288f.jpg","MobileHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/3dbd39d4c1401beb7773c38566cc4d728d7db4ed.jpg","Thumbnail":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/557facfa37e7e3a49d452635d811fd839d0145b2"},"licenseName":"CC BY ","licenseUrl":"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/2.0/","sourceUrl":"https://www.flickr.com/photos/justinjensen/4979561102/in/album-72157623671307590/"},"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-71.092115,42.360095,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-71.092115,42.360095,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":4.078859060402684,"count":596},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Cambridge, MA"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/massachusetts-institute-of-technology/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"5227aaf0-02d7-497d-ad78-aeacf304eb38","content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":true,"isPremium":false,"name":"Seattle University","type":"College","url":"seattle-university"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.7363},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":35627},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"1070-1290"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Junior","body":"I love it.

The campus is a very inviting environment; there are always events going on whether it is sports, diversity, or arts. The professors give off a warm, caring  aroma. No student should be afraid to ask for help from their professor; they are always willing whether it is through office hours or email. MSUM offers many ways to help students succeed; from tutoring to the Wellness Center for physical health. The campus is just the right size, not too small yet not overwhelming as well. As soon as I visited MSUM my senior year of high school, I knew it was home. Though, what I would like to see change is the exclusion from some activities held on campus. For example, they have activities that exclude some students from clubs or learning communities. I wish for more equality in allowing all students to be involved. Otherwise, I believe MSUM is a great place full of opportunities for students to further their education.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2017-11-26T05:07:52.397844Z","guid":"0ece1c33-a37d-4bed-abe0-cadcfc074cbc","rating":4},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":3}],"photos":{"default":{"crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/db9b3a0ff27f272424f505083bf388c9377f84cd.jpg","MobileHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/9579f183666104e0e7185a4591a4b5f6878c5147.jpg"},"licenseName":"UNLICENSED"},"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-96.763376,46.866482,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-96.763376,46.866482,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.4360795454545454,"count":704},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Moorhead, MN"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/minnesota-state-university-moorhead/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"7099c1c4-b34b-4969-9434-226a0a3a3933","content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"Bradley University","type":"College","url":"bradley-university"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.6981},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":26773},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"960-1240"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Senior","body":"Bradley, being a smaller school than a state school, allows students the opportunity to more easily connect with professors in a meaningful way.

It's worth it.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2018-04-25T21:33:11.038679Z","guid":"6b6f3c57-e027-475d-8fce-175b4064832b","rating":4},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":3.66}],"photos":{"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-104.889893,39.011115,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-104.889893,39.011115,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.567901234567901,"count":243},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"USAFA, CO"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/united-states-air-force-academy/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"b4bf129d-4944-4445-b5a5-6a23bb61a7f9","content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"Penn State Erie - The Behrend College","type":"College","url":"penn-state-erie---the-behrend-college"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.8785},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":22227},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"970-1210"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Niche User","body":"I really loved Penn State Behrend. My sister is a junior there right now and I will be joining her next year. The campus isn't too bug or too small, it's the perfect size. In addition, the campus is extremely safe. I never feel scared walking alone at night and have never heard of my sister having problems there. The academics are also great. The investment is well worth the education you get out of it.

The community is amazing, and the teachers genuinely care about their students. I am confident that I am getting a great education that will prepare me for the next level of my studies. Most importantly, Harding provides the unique experience of learning academically while also growing in your faith. Through bible classes, chapel, and the amazing students who attend this school, my relationship with The Lord is growing everyday. Harding has a lovely campus and is beautiful on the outside but what makes it the best is the students and teachers on the inside!","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2017-01-04T18:59:16.392229Z","guid":"fbf8f693-f03d-4c95-bd82-7f47f9d1fbb3","rating":5},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":3}],"photos":{"default":{"crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/36f58e9a645dfbaeb36e7e344442a26e3d512b14.jpg","MobileHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/9d65a6a61f1cdafd6bb8ad51fbf86e3e2366df8f.jpg"},"licenseName":"UNLICENSED"},"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-91.729008,35.249605,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-91.729008,35.249605,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.811279826464208,"count":922},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Searcy, AR"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/harding-university/#scatterplot"}}]}
