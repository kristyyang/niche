The learning center is a perfect place to go to if your struggling really bad in one of your classes. \n\nThe campus is really small, but doesn't have a lot of things to do unless an event is going on. Students can live in the towers that is shared between other universities like college park and Bowie near the Metro. A shuttle does travel between those two places to drop off students who have classes. There's no major parties going on campus and sports teams we have that play seriously. The campus have a lot of geeks and nerds that is into computers, video games, and anime. \n\nFinally, the financial aid office will help anyway they can to help your tuition and make sure you can come to Capitol.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2016-12-14T18:54:11.33008Z","guid":"43421a80-d634-40dd-87cc-599199c9621f","rating":4},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":2.33}],"photos":{"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-76.851413,39.047047,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-76.851413,39.047047,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.34375,"count":128},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Laurel, MD"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/capitol-technology-university/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"535f706c-75ba-4900-8f8a-3875d94b4138","content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"Concordia College - Alabama","type":"College","url":"concordia-college---alabama"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.2363},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":23006},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"520-1120"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Senior","body":"My experience at Concordia College Alabama is awesome.

I would recommend this school to individuals who want to live in a small town with beautiful surroundings.  Coming from a big city of crime and tribulations, this place gives me peace.  When I'm on or off campus, I feel safe.  The community has opened their hearts to the students of the College of St. Joseph.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2014-03-26T18:20:03Z","guid":"02b5d3ea-1260-41f3-9603-fe502cec02de","rating":4},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":2}],"photos":{"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-73.007033,43.599777,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-73.007033,43.599777,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.4285714285714284,"count":56},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Rutland, VT"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/college-of-st-joseph/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"871d9e26-de54-4ef2-90d5-a03ad374237c","content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"Maria College of Albany","type":"College","url":"maria-college-of-albany"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.4435},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":11135},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"727-990"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"College Freshman","body":"The professors and staff are very personable and easy to talk to.
