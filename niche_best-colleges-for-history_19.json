It's not perfect, but no college is. However, being a freshman, my transition from high school to college has been great. Most professors are super helpful and really like to challenge you. Campus safety is a goal that Rhode Island College strives to make their students feel. There is always RIC security driving through campus and many emergency push buttons all over. Which makes you feel very safe. The campus is small and beautiful and gives a home feeling like no other college I looked into. I am a commuter so I can not say what it is like living on campus. However the one downfall the college has is not enough parking spaces...Like ever. The school is mostly a commuter school which is cool, but parking can be horrendous depending on the time you have classes.

Greek life on this campus to me is one of the best in the country and one of the most wonderful organizations I've had the opportunity to be apart of. It not only provides an inclusiveness towards other organizations and the campus as a whole, but encourages students to work harder in both academia and community service. Along with Greek life this university has also provided many leadership opportunities that I wouldn't have had, had I gone somewhere else. While diversity on this campus tends to be lacking I was able to work with different multicultural organizations to change that aspect.

UT Tyler encourages students to push themselves, but also their staff is willing to aide the students in anyway they need to be successful.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2018-04-06T22:32:31.376669Z","guid":"18e944be-e036-4bef-8831-aa900c8441f1","rating":5},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":3}],"photos":{"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-95.249096,32.314724,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-95.249096,32.314724,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.648675171736997,"count":1019},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Tyler, TX"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/university-of-texas---tyler/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"2b68d7d2-2998-4b47-8421-5978b23e2739","content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":true,"isPremium":false,"name":"Marymount Manhattan College","type":"College","url":"marymount-manhattan-college"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.7816},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":35875},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"930-1170"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Sophomore","body":"I can't imagine being anywhere other than Marymount, but many dislike it because it isn't for them. Personally I LOVE small class sizes. I'm a communications major with a minor is business management and law and ethics. I get minimal homework and have straight As on the deans list just for participating. I came to Marymount a 2.8 GPA student and now have a 3.6. I love all my professors and really made strong relationships with them. Being in New York has endless possibilities. Comm classes are easy and class options are great. If you want to be a comm major, COME TO MARYMOUNT! Corey Liberman is the gem of the school and the best professor a student could ask for.  It's not right for everyone because it's a small school and it's a city campus. The school is very cliquey but If you're outgoing you'll have no problems making friends. last thing is if you want party life you need a fake ID but can still have fun without one just not as much.

The business, education, and journalism programs are all top notch and have many professors and advisors who are great with helping with job placement.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2018-03-15T20:22:10.952296Z","guid":"6ae7f5b3-2270-4713-8776-4047b44148ad","rating":4},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":3}],"photos":{"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-113.98294,46.861074,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-113.98294,46.861074,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.5176470588235293,"count":1785},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Missoula, MT"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/university-of-montana/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"b6a67ea2-900c-4e19-9801-a053c85a3251","content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"Ohio Northern University","type":"College","url":"ohio-northern-university"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.6411},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":24348},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"1030-1235"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Freshman","body":"Ohio Northern is a very prestiguous school full of opportunity.

Larger university classes weren’t for me, so Le Moyne was a perfect fit. The professors here actually get to know you and help you whenever needed, offering office hours and meetings by appointments. Le Moyne’s core curriculum requires all students of all majors to take different liberal arts classes, which I think is helpful for students who were unsure of their major starting out. The Jesuit education provided by Le Moyne is thorough and all around excellent. I also commuted to Le Moyne and I found that my professors were always understanding and accomodating if I were ever in the situation where I wouldn’t be able to attend class, such as weather conditions and other external forces that I wouldn’t be able to control. My experience at Le Moyne has been pleasant since day one, and I’m proud to be a soon-to-be graduate from this college.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2017-11-21T17:09:42.782005Z","guid":"cb2d8c6a-ef7d-4c92-be14-586f42c94485","rating":5},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":3}],"photos":{"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-76.088449,43.047316,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-76.088449,43.047316,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.5357142857142856,"count":532},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Syracuse, NY"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/le-moyne-college/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"d8a8b9c7-e227-4601-a904-be1d09d226de","content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":true,"isPremium":true,"name":"Eastern Connecticut State University","type":"College","url":"eastern-connecticut-state-university"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.5791},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":17014},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"930-1100"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Senior","body":"I have attended Eastern CT for my junior and senior years.  When I left the university in 2006, I was one credit away from my BS in Accounting.  When I came back, I was unaware of the new program (LAC) and I ended up having to take 3 classes to graduate.  When you pay that money out of your own pocket and you were only expecting to take 1 class, it hurts!  Be sure to check the requirements for coming back to the university to make sure you understand what you are looking at for classes and graduation requirements.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2017-12-28T13:38:54.867948Z","guid":"806d6b5a-f537-4c77-be2c-168159e4fbee","rating":4},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":3}],"photos":{"default":{"crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/1343180484ab4c99e551ce91dc92702d03601db0.jpg","MobileHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/c95f6528c2c63b86ccc87d4a4c366049b4e94b5c.jpg"},"licenseName":"UNLICENSED"},"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-72.218753,41.721673,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-72.218753,41.721673,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.306122448979592,"count":980},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Willimantic, CT"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/eastern-connecticut-state-university/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"a091d9ac-584a-4343-9eed-1e932814f807","content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":true,"isPremium":false,"name":"Emporia State University","type":"College","url":"emporia-state-university"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.8743},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":12939},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"910-1030"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Sophomore","body":"Emporia State is very diverse as well as accepting. The campus and over-all environment is friendly and full of life. The professors really seem to harness the one on one student relationships and make you seen as an individual. The only major downside is the food in the cafeteria. I lived in the Towers Residence Hall my freshman year and then came back as an RA the next year. It is a very open and safe environment. The dorms and campus provide many program opportunities varying from speakers to performers.  As for the town life, it is on the more boring side. There is not a lot to do here other than local restaurants. This makes it easier to focus on academics though!","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2018-04-25T00:23:37.929783Z","guid":"8e5aac34-5dd4-4dbf-a2fe-4aeaa6011bad","rating":4},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":3}],"photos":{"default":{"crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/f8557cdef197d8b7468ab185a94b25cdc5811573.jpg","MobileHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/15a822b9f8344d5790d81357ec977ce7db8dd1c3.jpg"},"licenseName":"UNLICENSED"},"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-96.179454,38.412583,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-96.179454,38.412583,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.57879234167894,"count":679},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Emporia, KS"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/emporia-state-university/#scatterplot"}}]}
