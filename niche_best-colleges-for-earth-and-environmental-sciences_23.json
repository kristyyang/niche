The courses were exactly what I was looking for and we even got to work with real clients in the Burlington area. This brings me to my second point, job placement and connections. I know the reason I decided to go to college was to broaden my opportunity for employment. There are so many opportunities to network, get internships, or gain experience that will help you when looking for jobs post-graduation. My final point is the campus. Visiting Campus is a MUST!

Student life and great and yes, there are undergraduates over 25 - Trinity has a marvelous program, Individualized Degree Program.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2018-01-09T03:35:12.065659Z","guid":"21cf4e28-834d-47de-86e2-d206806c175c","rating":5},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":3.33}],"photos":{"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-72.688684,41.746746,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-72.688684,41.746746,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.2761087267525038,"count":699},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Hartford, CT"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/trinity-college---connecticut/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"7506bda8-994b-4e7a-a0b8-cbd64bed03bb","content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"Union College - New York","type":"College","url":"union-college---new-york"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.369},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":38621},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"1220-1400"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Senior","body":"Review Continued: The social scene is Greek dominated; the Minerva system is an absolute joke.

Spring term at Union is still pretty lit though, given that we have ReUnion weekend, Lobster Fest, and Spring Fest.

Nothing beats this small and diverse campus.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2017-10-24T15:45:02.968179Z","guid":"09914e24-0821-4526-96e8-7880ed2eddc5","rating":5},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":4}],"photos":{"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-83.830729,40.766144,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-83.830729,40.766144,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.4526112185686655,"count":517},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Ada, OH"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/ohio-northern-university/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"73446a4f-a085-462a-8efb-3bab23d03fce","content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"Spelman College","type":"College","url":"spelman-college"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.3573},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":32399},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"980-1170"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Freshman","body":"Spelman is an amazing institution––coming here is the best decision I have made!

There is a wide range of subjects that are offered, so odds are that you will find the types of classes you are looking for.

I think it is important that there is diversity within professors and nonfaculty members because some students may feel more comfortable with a professor or staff of color.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2018-04-30T19:57:22.19563Z","guid":"4c1841c2-5fa9-4150-92be-52a2732c9974","rating":4},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade"}],"photos":{"default":{"crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/520d9efed0eeea242193c283dabeaf0dcc1c6a30.jpg","MobileHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/d12e9732c97a347df873d76f7efc47553fcd957f.jpg"},"licenseName":"UNLICENSED"},"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-94.32,45.56,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-94.32,45.56,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.65,"count":580},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"St. Joseph, MN"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/college-of-saint-benedict/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"ca055bc4-5a5c-4be8-8443-261c64edb677","content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"University of Illinois at Springfield","type":"College","url":"university-of-illinois-at-springfield"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.653},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":11444},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"886-1146"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Freshman","body":"Coming from a small town, this smaller college is perfect for me!
