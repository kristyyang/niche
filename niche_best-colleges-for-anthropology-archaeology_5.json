There's a wide variety of students here that guarantees ease in finding friends in classes and other places on campus.  There's also so much to do every week!  JMU offers so many organizations and clubs to join as well as fun activities for the whole campus to join in on.  The reason I didn't give JMU 5 stars is because there are some small difficulties that arise for me throughout the school year. For example, it is very difficult to register for classes and get all the classes you need to satisfy graduation requirements, especially as a freshman.  Also, because JMU is a smaller campus with a growing student population, there are always very long lines for food, for example, because they cannot cater to every single student.  These are just a few examples of small problems I face on campus, but overall, I love JMU!","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2017-12-24T17:09:20.796054Z","guid":"679eb716-52a9-4dfc-b4f9-a74c15bfe27b","rating":4},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":4}],"photos":{"default":{"crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/4db870c879f0c6df1a1e3ba4ff31e994f951edad.jpg","MobileHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/3a5ac8236426e56afa157a1ec322d5838b863cae.jpg","Thumbnail":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/c349de8eee19ea6f15f0642d0d8b16418148cac0"},"licenseName":"UNLICENSED"},"mapbox_header":{"crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-78.871663,38.435332,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-78.871663,38.435332,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"UNLICENSED"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.7404946474713916,"count":2709},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Harrisonburg, VA"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/james-madison-university/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"080c06af-62ff-4d43-9310-2e8c3c21a3f3","content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":true,"isPremium":true,"name":"Northern Arizona University","type":"College","url":"northern-arizona-university"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.78},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":14664},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"940-1160"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Junior","body":"NAU is a cozy home-away-from-home town.

It was fun and a good leg work out too! Also, the local areas for food is quite amazing. When needing to eat besides campus food, there is a wide variety of different ethnic food here. What I like to see a change in Humboldt is to give a more housing chances for students that are from far away. More housing in the campus for everyone to be. It is tough to find an apartment or house near the school and have the housing costs to be low, for future students coming from different parts of California or an out of state transfer, they should have the opportunity to have a low-cost housing and a secure home to be in.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2018-06-04T07:47:55.941084Z","guid":"69c3f499-369e-44c2-b940-7c35a6e57796","rating":4},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":3}],"photos":{"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-124.0814,40.8741,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-124.0814,40.8741,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.5448863636363637,"count":1760},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Arcata, CA"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/humboldt-state-university/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"7d19ae37-bb2c-4ad8-989f-5fd1cd0c45ce","content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"Washington State University","type":"College","url":"washington-state-university"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.7204},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":17815},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"930-1165"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Sophomore","body":"I've never seen a school so filled with pride! It's incredible to be a part of a family that is nationwide. I've been on vacation, states away, and have heard the familiar greeting of \"Go Cougs!\" from passing strangers. One of the most significant things I like to boast about is how safe and clean the campus is; schools in big cities just can't compete with those aspects of WSU.

In the beginning I was uncomfortable with my transition and unable to feel at home. Through clubs and sports teams I was able to develop new friendships and life skills that made me feel more at home. There are so many opportunities presented to students at USC that all should take advantage of. One of the most important things that is clearly valued here, is academics. My professors so far have been some of the most passionate people I have met. A favorite course I have taken here has been environmental ethics. I took this course as a philosophy requirement and it inspired me to change my major to environmental studies. The professor and the course material inspired me to make a decision that I will not soon regret. I am more than happy to say that I am a student at USC.

Hunter offers a plethora of majors to choose from as well as different clubs to keep students engaged. There are also activities and events held on campus. The workload may be overwhelming at times but I regard it as excellent preparation for graduate school and an opportunity to challenge myself. The location of Hunter is convenient; it is located in the city so your choices don't fall short when it comes to food. Hunter has a library on nine floors. My complaint is that when you attend Hunter no one tells you anything unless you ask many, many questions! I know several people who took the incorrect class for their major, wasting time and money. Additionally, I feel that in large lecture halls with more than 100 students, there isn't a chance to receive individualized attention. The classroom size should be smaller so professors can focus on every students' needs and struggles.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2018-01-16T22:01:16.773582Z","guid":"61dee6aa-64ee-4526-9449-0dd06859694f","rating":4},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":3}],"photos":{"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-73.964795,40.768669,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-73.964795,40.768669,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.439636752136752,"count":1872},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"New York, NY"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/cuny-hunter-college/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"19156948-0891-4637-9bf6-2b7e489aacc6","content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"Ohio University","type":"College","url":"ohio-university"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.7485},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":21899},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"990-1200"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Sophomore","body":"Ohio University is more than just the four years you are here.

Also Dale Hall is a ridiculous building and if you have a class there, get there early because trying to make your way through the crowds in that building can sometimes take a while. The parking situation & Dale Hall is the only thing preventing me from giving this great school 5 stars.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2017-11-06T00:20:34.290457Z","guid":"75f25a4a-6e57-4df8-b0a2-0b3897295b1c","rating":4},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":4}],"photos":{"default":{"crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/6a7d7e2d5c708a009e6b4857db0d69cf2efb39c4.jpg","MobileHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/eeb1688e862a426894b97137be0e4145307a7a24.jpg","Thumbnail":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/0dfb8859200ebd86bfb0acaf4b7740bcc6822455"},"licenseName":"UNLICENSED"},"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-97.445692,35.208152,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-97.445692,35.208152,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.7810136157337366,"count":2644},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Norman, OK"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/university-of-oklahoma/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"b21a90df-109d-4ced-ae82-7df91c120f2f","content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"University of West Florida","type":"College","url":"university-of-west-florida"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.4083},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":11175},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"950-1130"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Senior","body":"In my humble opinion based upon my experience, the University of West Florida may not be the best school to attend, but it is one of the best schools to attend within the state of Florida that provides enough of a return on your investment to count. Class sizes are normally small enough that professors can talk to and interact with students on a one-on-one basis to answer questions, to provide assistance, to facilitate conversation, and to even assist with opportunities. With more than seventy individual majors and the opportunities to earn multiple majors, students definitely have not only variety but choice to maximize the opportunities afforded to them to achieve their dreams. The Office of Undergraduate Research has been instrumental in allowing students to travel, to present research, and network, and students are often more than prepared to attend graduate schools and to fill the vacant job and/or leadership positions available after college.

I'm a sophomore now, and I love how open the campus is, and how there's a huge fountain by the lecture centers. When it's warm out, it's fun to hang out with friends by the fountain. Also, there's a lot of resources to help you choose your major, like the living-learning communities (which I was a part of freshman year). The university also helped me to study abroad in London!","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2018-03-20T20:09:06.06807Z","guid":"6d40422b-5676-47eb-aae2-5d88ec23dc8a","rating":5},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":3.33}],"photos":{"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-73.825014,42.686917,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-73.825014,42.686917,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.4414542020774315,"count":2118},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Albany, NY"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/university-at-albany-suny/#scatterplot"}}]}
