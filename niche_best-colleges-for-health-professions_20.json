Cannot beat the small class sizes and professor attention. Coming from Rutgers university i really appreciate that. Not as cutthroat as rutgers or other schools. I also actually like that each professor takes attendance and counts it as ten percent or more, of your grade. This encourages class attendance and pushes their students to do well. It is very possible to get a 4.0 if you show up to class and put in the effort, which for some classes requires less work than others.  I gave 4/5 because of the parking situation although they are trying to improve this situation by adding across the street parking. Parking is available but you may need to walk a bit or take the shuttle from other parts of campus.

Smith University has given me an experience I would never forget. Being from a poor family as well as neighborhood once gave me the impression that I would not leave that situation. Battling depression and other feelings were indescribable as far as words go. I visited JCSU during my preteen years and could only dream of a chance to enroll. Well, 2017 I was accepted and experienced college at 27 years old. That was the most exhilarating, unbelievable, phenomenal moment in my life. I strongly recommend JCSU to anyone looking to make a change for themselves or study in a pleasant environment.JCSU saved my life.  My name is Eric Darcey Flowe and I want to personally thankJohnson C. Smith University!","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2017-12-24T02:55:44.957726Z","guid":"43a36fb8-ffee-4138-97cf-3cef2442fdf2","rating":5},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":2.33}],"photos":{"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-80.854842,35.243384,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-80.854842,35.243384,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.222772277227723,"count":808},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Charlotte, NC"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/johnson-c-smith-university/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"305f34bd-c28b-45a5-8767-25ad1cd6f5dd","content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"Olivet College","type":"College","url":"olivet-college"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.5335},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":20973},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"870-1180"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Sophomore","body":"Olivet College is a very nice school all together.

For UTSA being a relitavley new school, it has established itself well in the Alamo city with its engaging Fiesta events such as Best Fest during the spring semester. I love how transparent Roadrunner’s are and how we are always willing to lend a hand to a friend in need. The parking situation can be a bit tedious at times, but besides that, UTSA has been a wonderful college experience so far!","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2018-03-29T00:16:07.126026Z","guid":"a0a82b20-2a48-40d3-9a02-7826063f6b12","rating":4},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":3}],"photos":{"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-98.621386,29.582418,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-98.621386,29.582418,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.6568002041337078,"count":3919},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"San Antonio, TX"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/university-of-texas---san-antonio/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"3ed520d7-0315-4f25-b696-562531d896d3","badge":{"display":"Best Colleges in America","ordinal":751,"total":1644,"vanityURL":"best-colleges"},"content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"University of Texas - Rio Grande Valley","type":"College","url":"university-of-texas---rio-grande-valley"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.6393},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":4432},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"850-1050"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Freshman","body":"I love UTRGV because it's so close to my own house. If you're looking for a college that'll ensure you get your basics done and career into Engineering/Nursing, then this school is the one! The people I've met at UTRGV aren't the best individuals, but the ones that stick around in your life are the real treasure here. The culture here is very friendly and despite me working part-time here, all my 'customers' are nice and friendly and very patient with New comers! The teachers you meet show that they actually put genuine thought and belief into the subject that they teach, unlike most Highschools you recently get out of. The people you meet with when assigned for groups actually care about their grade, so I doubt you'll find much slackers trying to sink the group down by not contributing. It's a small college though, but I'm okay with it!","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2017-11-13T20:47:08.203495Z","guid":"7c15031e-64ae-4195-9d22-8447c482eb4f","rating":4},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":3}],"photos":{"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-98.172112,26.306629,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-98.172112,26.306629,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.6126924871675223,"count":2143},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Edinburg, TX"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/university-of-texas---rio-grande-valley/#scatterplot"}}]}
