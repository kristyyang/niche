It wasn't really at the forefront of my mind but I'm so glad I decided to go here. I did the NU-in program and had a great time in London. My experience at the university has been super positive when it comes to academics and my social life. The professors are hard working and qualified, the people are friendly, there are a lot of kids from all over the world, and the campus is awesome! Most students come to Northeastern because of the co-op program which is the most significant part of the university. The university does a really great job of preparing students for the workplace and makes sure you are qualified and competitive when it is your time to apply for them. I would recommend this university to students who are social, hard-working and competitive.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2018-03-22T21:35:03.369409Z","guid":"79d52442-1c21-49a5-9876-27dccd81c450","rating":5},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":4.33}],"photos":{"default":{"crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/fe66f26254caf6de36fea90af9c4849312e4cb64.jpg","MobileHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/2a1f855cc82936d84ac86d8ca7db2777be300743.jpg","Thumbnail":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/63bbec5d35965d2eb9fdaca02a8d43cd5b1ef488"},"licenseName":"UNLICENSED"},"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-71.088782,42.339992,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-71.088782,42.339992,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.662531017369727,"count":3224},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Boston, MA"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/northeastern-university/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"d8e776e3-b586-4ca3-9b96-3be5437a570d","badge":{"display":"Best Colleges for Economics in America","ordinal":52,"total":424,"vanityURL":"best-colleges-for-economics"},"content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":true,"isPremium":true,"name":"Colby College","type":"College","url":"colby-college"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.1871},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":21032},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"1270-1470"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Alum","body":"When I reflect on my time at Colby, I am grateful for the small liberal arts experience; the feeling of community, small class sizes with professors who knew your name, and free printing. I am now pursuing post-graduate studies at a big University and the resources available to students, professor expertise, and quality of coursework is inferior to Colby in almost every way. Colby students are friendly, extremely intelligent, and well-rounded. Most of my friends volunteered, had an on-campus job or worked in a lab, and actively participated in campus clubs. The Colby bubble can become a little suffocating, as it is easy to not leave campus for weeks, but I am honestly sad I will never be in such a tight-knit community of similar-minded peers again. Colby is not perfect by all means, but it's a damn good school. If you choose to go to Colby, go in with an open mind, positive attitude, and readiness to introduce yourself to a million people.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2017-12-29T03:27:58.977015Z","guid":"bfdf69be-e5e9-4bb4-9ef6-0d01bd59e2e7","rating":4},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":4.33}],"photos":{"default":{"crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/dfdaf6431156601d8dae33ecab8f2ffe44140ae0.jpg","MobileHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/033e87f66b4397f2d715ed17e562a91b10c0024d.jpg","Thumbnail":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/1b8ae1cb324d4beb19924b807180732918207245"},"licenseName":"UNLICENSED"},"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-69.66337,44.564211,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-69.66337,44.564211,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.72635814889336,"count":497},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Waterville, ME"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/colby-college/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"fbf152a7-a7f6-4afb-9fd7-143864f74928","badge":{"display":"Best Colleges for Economics in America","ordinal":53,"total":424,"vanityURL":"best-colleges-for-economics"},"content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"Tulane University","type":"College","url":"tulane-university"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.255},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":32515},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"1240-1410"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Freshman","body":"I love Tulane!

Constant micro-aggressions wherever you go make life in general tough to deal with.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2017-09-28T01:22:27.354795Z","guid":"a34cefb4-ec9f-4db0-b3c9-1255b763cb36","rating":4},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":4.33}],"photos":{"default":{"author":"denverjeffrey","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/db6d095fbee180989406ab45959bb1a5b041b99f.jpg","MobileHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/adbe9c372aafd1e7372de68d1b0209bbe42dbc99.jpg","Thumbnail":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/9ee676e0238090642134ebc7dbdb958145416427"},"licenseName":"CC BY-SA","licenseUrl":"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/","sourceUrl":"https://www.flickr.com/photos/denverjeffrey/6421757137/"},"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-104.82422,38.84657,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-104.82422,38.84657,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.625,"count":720},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Colorado Springs, CO"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/colorado-college/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"4caa6248-6cbc-40bf-af3a-42650b42a8e9","badge":{"display":"Best Colleges for Economics in America","ordinal":57,"total":424,"vanityURL":"best-colleges-for-economics"},"content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":true,"isPremium":false,"name":"Villanova University","type":"College","url":"villanova-university"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.435},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":33270},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"1220-1420"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Senior","body":"As someone who is not at all religious, I was a little concerned about coming to a Catholic university, but I am sure glad that I did!

Overall, this university was perfect for someone like me: someone who wanted to focus on her studies but still have the opportunity to socialize and just have fun!","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2018-06-08T02:02:13.696067Z","guid":"3f39b0fe-3d50-4c35-8ec2-4e963d713df4","rating":5},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":4.33}],"photos":{"default":{"crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/8f43535583cdaa2ab96b1ff96cec5a5a8576ffde.jpg","MobileHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/c6bcbb1f19d0cd28c9602ae6d864079e458aa071.jpg","Thumbnail":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/8820399ac20c718edc35080c3909845d1408232a"},"licenseName":"UNLICENSED"},"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-83.374049,33.956428,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-83.374049,33.956428,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.9070371851259496,"count":5002},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Athens, GA"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/university-of-georgia/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"da2df813-e778-4fde-a257-55b26ec02ed3","badge":{"display":"Best Colleges for Economics in America","ordinal":64,"total":424,"vanityURL":"best-colleges-for-economics"},"content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign","type":"College","url":"university-of-illinois-at-urbana-champaign"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.6007},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":16683},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"1285-1480"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Sophomore","body":"UIUC is a great school with lots of options for everyone.

We could also take classes at Swarthmore and UPenn even though that's more uncommon but if you really want to do it you can. The students can get a little rattled when it comes to politics and it's really liberal, some people like that others don't, just depends on who you talk to. The campus is sooo beautiful all throughout the year! And housing is one the best parts because most of the rooms are really big and you can get a single your sophomore year. The college also does a good job at matching roommates for first years.

For instance, I am a double major in Government and International Relations and Global Studies and am continuously amazed at the amount of programs, events, lectures , courses, and books available just for students in those majors. Your college's department of Career Services will blow you away as well, they will provide any and all resources to ensure your success after graduation. Most of all, UT is a highly respected university in the state of Texas and beyond, a degree from UT will go a very long way! I highly recommend studying here.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2018-04-04T20:57:10.298437Z","guid":"1b42f115-4293-493e-ab3c-4ebb9fead894","rating":5},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":4.33}],"photos":{"default":{"author":"jrandallc","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/062118de6b330627760d55de6c32cf824efa040b.jpg","MobileHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/8af2b0aa0e38489ab3331f7d629df02edec81728.jpg","Thumbnail":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/154967d69077062224951037e47fe52285fdde61"},"licenseName":"CC BY-SA","licenseUrl":"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/","sourceUrl":"https://www.flickr.com/photos/jrandallc/5207440826/"},"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-97.737279,30.284733,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-97.737279,30.284733,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.9090425531914894,"count":5640},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Austin, TX"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/university-of-texas---austin/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"4f186de4-b8ba-4895-981e-cce08c5a0c50","badge":{"display":"Best Colleges for Economics in America","ordinal":70,"total":424,"vanityURL":"best-colleges-for-economics"},"content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"Mount Holyoke College","type":"College","url":"mount-holyoke-college"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.5219},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":27234},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"1220-1490"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Sophomore","body":"Mount Holyoke College is a lovely, accepting institution. It creates a beautiful community of bright students who engage in rigorous academic discourse in and out of the classroom. Though at times the administration is a bit self-serving and secretive, all the positives outweigh this part. My only suggestion is that they make good on their promise of being a liberal and progressive institution by becoming a sanctuary campus and divesting from fossil fuels. But otherwise it is a great place for a student wanting an academic challenge and looking for a loving community that will be supportive and understanding no matter your background.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2017-12-13T02:03:07.259558Z","guid":"911aa725-a425-4b15-8183-f639661512af","rating":5},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":4.33}],"photos":{"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-72.573625,42.257588,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-72.573625,42.257588,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.7236679058240396,"count":807},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"South Hadley, MA"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/mount-holyoke-college/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"a1541d26-e31e-4935-91a6-bace82415430","badge":{"display":"Best Colleges for Economics in America","ordinal":71,"total":424,"vanityURL":"best-colleges-for-economics"},"content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":true,"isPremium":false,"name":"Pitzer College","type":"College","url":"pitzer-college"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.1374},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":25521},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"1300-1450"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Freshman","body":"My dream school!

It deserves much more individual recognition because it really is such a unique educational establishment. I am so lucky I go here and recommend it to anyone who is really looking to go to school with passionate and brilliant peers.

Thanks to Oxy, I was able to get connected to many great opportunities such as study abroad, and now I am a Fulbright grantee. It is definitely a very liberal campus so may be difficult for conservative students but this climate definitely challenges conservative students to clearly think through their opinions and convictions, ultimately molding everyone to be a more careful thinker, more articulate speaker and writer, and better global citizen.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2018-02-23T13:41:41.112665Z","guid":"887a2db1-f1aa-4ddd-b666-7a87fd8bcae3","rating":5},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":4}],"photos":{"default":{"crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/23de020ed1f1e711fce623b93d51658fd31845ef.jpg","MobileHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/ae7e258edc46e9db455df5d463c1be2ae7c17d43.jpg","Thumbnail":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/be9a22e0a8a992cf1aec55766e9178fe18c527dc"},"licenseName":"UNLICENSED"},"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-118.210783,34.126224,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-118.210783,34.126224,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.6056338028169015,"count":426},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Los Angeles, CA"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/occidental-college/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"f7397325-1b91-4a7c-a3d6-eaa23fd294ae","badge":{"display":"Best Colleges for Economics in America","ordinal":73,"total":424,"vanityURL":"best-colleges-for-economics"},"content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"University of Miami","type":"College","url":"university-of-miami"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.3771},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":37424},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"1210-1390"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Freshman","body":"Coral Gables is home to the University of Miami, an elite university, known commonly as “The U.” With its perpetual sunshine and swaying palm trees, the University of Miami enjoys the cool ambience of the tropics, while also holding the title of a Top 50 school.
