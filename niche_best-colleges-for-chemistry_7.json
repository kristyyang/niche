Hunter offers a plethora of majors to choose from as well as different clubs to keep students engaged. There are also activities and events held on campus. The workload may be overwhelming at times but I regard it as excellent preparation for graduate school and an opportunity to challenge myself. The location of Hunter is convenient; it is located in the city so your choices don't fall short when it comes to food. Hunter has a library on nine floors. My complaint is that when you attend Hunter no one tells you anything unless you ask many, many questions! I know several people who took the incorrect class for their major, wasting time and money. Additionally, I feel that in large lecture halls with more than 100 students, there isn't a chance to receive individualized attention. The classroom size should be smaller so professors can focus on every students' needs and struggles.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2018-01-16T22:01:16.773582Z","guid":"61dee6aa-64ee-4526-9449-0dd06859694f","rating":4},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":3}],"photos":{"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-73.964795,40.768669,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-73.964795,40.768669,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.439636752136752,"count":1872},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"New York, NY"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/cuny-hunter-college/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"ca9e78bf-8de1-4bd5-bf56-44aaa482e523","content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":true,"isPremium":false,"name":"CUNY Brooklyn College","type":"College","url":"cuny-brooklyn-college"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.3749},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":9771},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"1010-1200"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Junior","body":"Going to Brooklyn College was the best decision I ever made.

Other than that I love it and would highly recommend.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2018-01-26T01:07:56.958209Z","guid":"31f670bf-b1ed-42e0-a2da-545b19dc7aea","rating":5},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":3.33}],"photos":{"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-123.108777,45.521394,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-123.108777,45.521394,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.532503457814661,"count":723},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Forest Grove, OR"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/pacific-university/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"4c0c3bd6-d051-4db4-bea3-8aee452c57c4","content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"Christopher Newport University","type":"College","url":"christopher-newport-university"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.6216},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":22637},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"1060-1250"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Sophomore","body":"My first year at CNU was amazing! The outside scenery is beautiful. The grass, flowers, buildings, equipment, etc is very well up kept. The University President is extremely friendly and proactive within the community, which gives a very welcoming feeling. The dorms are very nice compared to other colleges surrounding the peninsula. The student to teacher ratio really helps students become comfortable with asking questions in a formal setting and learn more hands on.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2018-05-14T20:09:32.144281Z","guid":"6859f13c-a1b5-4c01-8ffb-6969d1981319","rating":4},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":3.66}],"photos":{"default":{"crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/9db35e29bf7638d281fb6cc9e2adb1e7cef54f9f.jpg","MobileHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/e625192e33778a2000c82bb8f254b983b41e4217.jpg"},"licenseName":"UNLICENSED"},"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-76.486978,37.061502,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-76.486978,37.061502,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.6666666666666665,"count":1107},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Newport News, VA"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/christopher-newport-university/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"3bd96e46-a63c-4585-ba02-796f127f4cef","content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"University of California - Riverside","type":"College","url":"university-of-california---riverside"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.6634},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":12841},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"940-1190"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Freshman","body":"If coming from the Bay Area, you'll be disappointed about the diversity of cuisine in the surrounding area of the campus. The residential hall food is alright and are always buffet style so there can always be something for you to eat. But once in awhile you'll get tired of it, but do not fret! There are dining dollars that you can use for on campus dining that is not in the dining halls. I have been told that the quality of food here has been better so if you are thinking about attending this school, do not expect much but do expect a growth in quality while you're here. If you do not wish to dine on campus, there is a university village that is a 15-20 minute walk away with more restaurants for you to experience. You will be given discounts at the theater there and coupons for being a student at UCR.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2017-12-09T18:55:37.124305Z","guid":"1f33e0c3-c954-4939-881e-1a61b963d1d0","rating":4},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":3.66}],"photos":{"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-117.331098,33.97588,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-117.331098,33.97588,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.499163599866176,"count":2989},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Riverside, CA"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/university-of-california---riverside/#scatterplot"}}]}
