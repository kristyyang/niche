My favorite part of this university is all the learning opportunities it brings. In class, the learning style is so different from anything I had ever seen because we are taught to learn from other people's experiences and by engaging in conversations. Here, we aspire to be very politically and socially aware of different issues going around the world. There are organizations directed to many communities and they are really welcoming. Outside the classroom, those organizations could potentially become your family. The great thing about The New School is that it is very respectful of individuality. If you are a very \"on you own\" person that is respected but if you love being with people and socializing all the time you can find your space too. Also, the facilities are great and it is all located in the heart of New York City making it an amazing campus.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2018-04-04T23:31:36.327016Z","guid":"d81779b6-c8b7-413c-92b0-9fd0004f4d60","rating":5},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":3.66}],"photos":{"default":{"crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/20ff6502e17c54b03c03f44404216637012986ae.jpg","MobileHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/b73cd1410a49caf8011dcafe12dbd53f726eee3e.jpg"},"licenseName":"UNLICENSED"},"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-73.994636,40.735275,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-73.994636,40.735275,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.5483271375464684,"count":538},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"New York, NY"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/the-new-school/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"f1beaf3e-6d1e-4f1c-9095-edc88fcee003","badge":{"display":"Best Colleges in America","ordinal":584,"total":1644,"vanityURL":"best-colleges"},"content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"Pace University","type":"College","url":"pace-university"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.8368},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":31040},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"940-1160"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Freshman","body":"I really like it here at Pace University, there are so many opportunities available to students.

Aside from that, there are many campus activities and clubs for students to join, and there is always free food available at one event or the other! The faculty are very helpful and they are invested in seeing students succeed, which can really help boost student morale.

It is a great school academically and provides all of the opportunities a student could want in terms of good professors, real life experience and a supportive culture. Looking at the social aspect of the school, Butler has a very-tight knit group of student that share similar values (\"The Butler Way\"). Also, it is great to be so close to Broad Ripple and Downtown as this is obviously a big advantage both professionally and socially. Diversity on campus is not great, but I do think it is getting better. All in all, I would 100% recommend Butler if you are still deciding.

It's still small enough to see friends around campus, but big enough to give students the sense of freedom every young adult is looking for when leaving home for the first time. With that, the architecture is beautiful. The hilly streets and tree covered parks add to the breath taking sights as well. It has a great variety of majors, including some of the highest ranked schools in the nation: Kelly, Jacobs, and a few others. Indiana University also includes a number of outstanding graduate programs that have been ranked among the best in the United States. On top of the outstanding scenery and large variety of academics, Indiana University also offers tons of great social groups. This includes a very large Greek life community and practically any club you can think of.

I think NCSU has one of the best engineering and communication programs here on campus and they also have a lot of resources at our libraries and everywhere else on campus. Their database is incredible and the library has so much information for you to refer to when doing research or completing an essay. This University has a strong reputation of academic success as well competitive students, which is makes our school very exciting.

The food options on campus and around the town of Boone are amazing. Most things are locally grown and harvested, with plenty of Vegan/Vegetarian and gluten free/allergy free options. The atmosphere on campus and through out the whole community is one of adventure and excitement. The students really enjoy getting outside and getting active. The Blue Ridge Parkway has some of the best views in the United States, but I may be a little biased!

A lot of work is required, but I'm sure that goes for any university. There are students of all ages. The parking is TERRIBLE. The school has purchased all parking anywhere near the school and parking permits are needed everywhere. I tried to buy a parking permit but there were no more available. So I was forced to walk a mile to classes, and even still had to pay at parking meters. I didn't mind the walk, but sometimes could not find parking. Another thing I didn't appreciate is that there are no places where I could pump my breast milk, since I am a breastfeeding momma. I always had to pump in restrooms which seemed unsanitary and quite frankly stinky at times. My adviser has been great! She is very helpful.

Unlike bigger schools, UNA's professors are able to give students more one on one attention by offering smaller classes, and students feel free to engage more, thus building their success! There are many organizations on campus that adhere to everyone's interests. From being a dancer as a Lionette in the Pride of Dixie Marching Band, to joining the Student Public Relations organization, there are many opportunities for students to gain crucial experience that will build their resumes.

Classes are small and  only taught by professors with PHDs who are entirely invested in their students and will  know you by name within a few weeks. The curriculum is in depth and aimed at preparing you for real world employment, or to continue your education.  WNEU is well managed, with many opportunities to grow through clubs, activities, community involvement, and options to study abroad.    The campus is a must see, offering state of the art facilities and technology with impeccably manicured grounds and an amazingly clean campus.   The college offers many scholarships  to students who excel academically.  As a second year Junior, I am having a tremendous college experience and highly recommend you put WNEU high on your list, and please come and take a tour, as I cannot possibly tell you all this University has to offer.  Good luck in your search!","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2017-01-08T15:51:57.782614Z","guid":"5e5506d6-d680-4901-a314-830f2d822029","rating":5},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":3}],"photos":{"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-72.518789,42.115837,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-72.518789,42.115837,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.6078147612156295,"count":691},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Springfield, MA"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/western-new-england-university/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"36b7ed23-88e8-4cba-b032-180e591f9ac3","badge":{"display":"Best Colleges in America","ordinal":825,"total":1644,"vanityURL":"best-colleges"},"content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"Drury University","type":"College","url":"drury-university"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.6997},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":22181},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"1010-1220"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Sophomore","body":"I truly love attending Drury through the online program.
