It's still small enough to see friends around campus, but big enough to give students the sense of freedom every young adult is looking for when leaving home for the first time. With that, the architecture is beautiful. The hilly streets and tree covered parks add to the breath taking sights as well. It has a great variety of majors, including some of the highest ranked schools in the nation: Kelly, Jacobs, and a few others. Indiana University also includes a number of outstanding graduate programs that have been ranked among the best in the United States. On top of the outstanding scenery and large variety of academics, Indiana University also offers tons of great social groups. This includes a very large Greek life community and practically any club you can think of.

The more you effectively invest in Cal State Fullerton, the more you will benefit from it.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2018-06-02T04:40:27.14261Z","guid":"4aaf0740-f500-4f4e-8095-457fb9754e83","rating":5},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":3.33}],"photos":{"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-117.885349,33.883627,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-117.885349,33.883627,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.6349315068493153,"count":4380},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Fullerton, CA"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/california-state-university---fullerton/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"7d19ae37-bb2c-4ad8-989f-5fd1cd0c45ce","badge":{"display":"Best Colleges for Criminal Justice in America","ordinal":113,"total":484,"vanityURL":"best-colleges-for-criminal-justice"},"content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"Washington State University","type":"College","url":"washington-state-university"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.7204},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":17815},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"930-1165"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Sophomore","body":"I've never seen a school so filled with pride!

And, as a young woman living across the state in a new and unfamiliar environment, I can't appreciate enough how hospitable Pullman and the WSU campus is.

Some people do not feel comfortable at these big schools and can sometimes get overwhelmed by the number of students that attend here.

I was surprised at how much I liked the large classes, as I was always a class participator in class. The further you get in your major, the smaller the classes are which is always nice. In the past, whenever I told people I attended Penn State, the reaction was always a positive one.

As a first in family minority student, I was reluctant to go to a big school not known to have a diverse student body. However, I’ve noticed the freshman student body is  more diverse than I expected and the school is not as big as I thought. I see many of the people in my hall around campus. The class sizes are small 15-25 students. The city of Oneonta is cute and transportation to the mall and other main spots is easily accessible. The RA’s are always there to help me with anything big or small. The freshman dorms seem to be the newest!

From understanding the course work to finding an internship or getting involved on campus, they truly make an effort to make sure that we are taking advantage of all the opportunities that are provided here at Baldwin Wallace University.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2017-03-09T19:53:11.024626Z","guid":"b351ab97-ef61-430c-a2d6-52a89f5939d1","rating":4},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":3.66}],"photos":{"default":{"crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/d31a9707b8a305eeafd3074f9c59952ee328a857.jpg","MobileHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/aa5aac8511a626728cb9f3b950dd44170e525c14.jpg"},"licenseName":"UNLICENSED"},"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-81.849112,41.373938,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-81.849112,41.373938,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.516298633017876,"count":951},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Berea, OH"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/baldwin-wallace-university/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"a0f566ad-11d3-485b-8879-df105d764754","badge":{"display":"Best Colleges for Criminal Justice in America","ordinal":129,"total":484,"vanityURL":"best-colleges-for-criminal-justice"},"content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"SUNY Farmingdale State College","type":"College","url":"suny-farmingdale-state-college"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.5802},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":8687},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"880-1060"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Alum","body":"My overall experience with Farmingdale State College was great. There’s a lot of diversity at Farmingdale, such as career choices, culture, and lifestyle . Farmingdale urges you to express exactly who you are. There are many clubs that allow you to really liberate yourself and express how you feel, what you like and that you are supported no matter what. I met a lot of people at very different stages in their lives. Some were like me, who went straight from high school into college. Others were returning to college or starting college for the first time ever who had graduated from high school years ago. Not only did I feel I had great peers, but I had outstanding professors who not only filled me with knowledge but genuinely cared about me and my process. The only thing I would change is  making clubs mandatory. So more students would attend.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2018-05-27T14:30:17.724711Z","guid":"acb8bba3-98ac-42da-9cc4-8ea5fe373aca","rating":4},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":3}],"photos":{"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-73.426371,40.75408,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-73.426371,40.75408,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.708,"count":500},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Farmingdale, NY"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/suny-farmingdale-state-college/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"d27ab0e0-17e9-4562-b987-bcc1457d45e7","badge":{"display":"Best Colleges for Criminal Justice in America","ordinal":130,"total":484,"vanityURL":"best-colleges-for-criminal-justice"},"content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"University of Colorado - Denver","type":"College","url":"university-of-colorado---denver"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.6052},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":13751},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"960-1190"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"College Sophomore","body":"My experience at CU Denver has surpassed my expectations. I was terrified when I first started, but today I am completely in love with my classes, my teachers, my friends, and the overall campus! My favorite experiences so far have been the community events organized by the campus. The first week always consists of different activities and events everyday so that students can gather around the campus, get to know others, learn about clubs/activities, and get food and school themed clothes as well. My campus has a block party in Denver since it's right across the street where music and food is provided, along with tables and tents promoting all the clubs and organizations available on campus. These events continue throughout the year and make it fun and exciting to try new things.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2016-08-30T21:31:58Z","guid":"f92e489b-57f9-4d0d-aef6-fe4da407dbaf","rating":4},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":3.66}],"photos":{"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-104.999181,39.74603,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-104.999181,39.74603,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.545918367346939,"count":1568},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Denver, CO"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/university-of-colorado---denver/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"1a5f1fe1-079e-4a87-8e2e-f2cba9fec67a","badge":{"display":"Best Colleges for Criminal Justice in America","ordinal":132,"total":484,"vanityURL":"best-colleges-for-criminal-justice"},"content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"East Texas Baptist University","type":"College","url":"east-texas-baptist-university"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.5093},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":20960},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"870-1050"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Alum","body":"I enjoyed my time at ETBU.

Athletics is a huge part of the student life at ETBU (was an athlete) and there is always an event to attend on the weekends. If its a hockey game, baseball, concert, or CONEXUS there is always something to do! ETBU is a family and those connections can be found even after graduation.
