The friendly staff. And helpful, knowledgeable professors. The classes offered and location of the campus is exactly what I need for me to be successful. My only issue was advising. The staff cared and really wanted to help but they weren't always set up for success with students. They often didn't have the information I thought they should, and would ask me to come later in the semester, or for my email. This way they could ask someone and give my an answer when they knew. Overall I enjoyed the campus for the environment and academics. Just not always the processes.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2018-01-19T02:48:46.406318Z","guid":"89b78747-2249-48c4-b2f6-b6d40ace93c6","rating":4},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade"}],"photos":{"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-82.562951,27.391766,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-82.562951,27.391766,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.73972602739726,"count":73},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Sarasota, FL"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/university-of-south-florida---sarasota-manatee/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"0361ac03-ad53-45c5-821c-4c6250555441","content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"MidAmerica Nazarene University","type":"College","url":"midamerica-nazarene-university"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.5181},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":18414},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"790-980"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Senior","body":"MNU is a great Christian university!
