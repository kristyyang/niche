Professors vary from each other; since the university is a research university (and they take pride over that), your professors will vary from individual to individual. It's not surprising if your professor is super smart but horrible in teaching. You really have to fight for yourself here in studying, but that's not saying there aren't good Professors at all - there are! Emphasis on Professors because sometimes that's just what'll make or break your happiness for that quarter or so.\n\nThat being said, it's also not surprising to question your tuition here if it's worth it or not.

But our campus contains such diversity that you run into people different than you all the time. Campus activities promote integration of all students, from athletes to bookish types, from African American students to South Korean students.\nThe one thing that many people are weary about is the lifestyle statement, which prohibits many of the 'typical college' activities (smoking, drinking, sex on campus, etc). As an RA, my interactions with the lifestyle statement have given me a broad perspective of the pros and cons of having such an agreement. As a Christian community I think it is imperative that we hold our students to a wholesome standard. However, for those students who do not practice Christianity, I have seen isolation and exclusion on occasion.\nOverall, I love Greenville and am content with my choice for my educational advancement.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2018-02-28T01:52:25.072542Z","guid":"2485c9ef-88ae-471d-846d-63a7487891ef","rating":4},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":3}],"photos":{"default":{"crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/fdd4165fcee1e058a86cf3a51f22704d6bad62b1.jpg","MobileHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/8642a02b748cd3ca2b270e88dceaada520d88779.jpg"},"licenseName":"UNLICENSED"},"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-89.4089,38.8928,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-89.4089,38.8928,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.458974358974359,"count":390},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Greenville, IL"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/greenville-university/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"9b3fc9b7-7059-469b-8f96-510c07e44215","content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":true,"isPremium":false,"name":"Trevecca Nazarene University","type":"College","url":"trevecca-nazarene-university"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.7227},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":17898},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"930-1140"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Freshman","body":"Trevecca has a fantastic faculty with amazing programs of study.

The atmosphere on campus and through out the whole community is one of adventure and excitement. The students really enjoy getting outside and getting active.

It will feel like home by the end of that week, and you'll feel at least a little ready for the first day of classes. I've been here for a week now, and I know already that i chose the right school! I chose this school for its reputation in nursing.  In addition to its great reputation, the food is great(lots of options too), bathrooms are clean, showers/sinks arent crowded, people are generally approachable and pleasant(although i can sniff the fakeness of some from a mile away), and the campus/city is very attractive and admirable.

Public Safety constantly picks up any fallen tree branches, shovels snow, and checks buildings to keep the campus safe. Annville is a small quiet town and the elderly are not afraid to call the police if the parties get too rowdy.  The campus food is not the best, but there is always a salad bar and deli.

The professors here really care about your college experience, and the counselors are extremely open to helping you out when you are struggling with your classes/major/whatever it may be.  If there was something that I could recommend that we add to our campus it would be to maybe remodel the interior of the Knight library, because it's definitely starting to fall apart. All of the carpets and chairs are getting really old and grungy, and I think that having a prettier interior would attract many more students to study in the library!","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2018-06-07T21:22:44.164492Z","guid":"c34e74cf-2326-446f-aed9-80705582a3d7","rating":4},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":4}],"photos":{"default":{"crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/8d9cf476be2830468d2e26490a11c8d927ca87c2.jpg","MobileHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/b3890e5e5423b7050291f1a24f0d5a53dacb2000.jpg","Thumbnail":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/afbb39fef9daff2908a86b2279d485943ae73a80"},"licenseName":"UNLICENSED"},"mapbox_header":{"crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-123.076,44.042,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-123.076,44.042,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"UNLICENSED"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.6842751842751844,"count":3256},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Eugene, OR"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/university-of-oregon/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"f668bff9-0793-44cd-81ea-0b66aa099485","content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"Elmhurst College","type":"College","url":"elmhurst-college"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.7189},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":18825},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"900-1170"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Junior","body":"Yes, Elmhurst College is a small school! But that is what makes Elmhurst the best college to go to! Having a small number of students in your field of program such as Elementary Education is crucial. That means there are not that many graduates from a great college looking for a job in the same area as you. You are able to build a relationship with each of your professors because the class size is about 20 students. Having a real connection with your professor means they get to know you and you get to know them. They will be great references or write great recommendations for whatever you need. In addition to professors, you create long lasting friendships with your peers. Everyone becomes close and you  support each other to get through the semester. I recommend applying to Elmhurst College first.

The bus system used to transport students from one campus to another is unfortunately sub-par. The drivers take frequent and long breaks, which inconveniences students trying to get to class.
