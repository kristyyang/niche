I find that CSULA is very safety-conscious, maintains an excellent campus environment and student life, and hires very impressive and motivated professors who instill knowledge and their own passions into the students they teach. However, if there are two aspects that I would like to see CSULA improve on, they would be the local area and campus food. I would appreciate it if there were interesting activities to participate in in the local area and if there was a much bigger variety of healthy food choices aside from the food trucks and the food court.

Cannot beat the small class sizes and professor attention. Coming from Rutgers university i really appreciate that. Not as cutthroat as rutgers or other schools. I also actually like that each professor takes attendance and counts it as ten percent or more, of your grade. This encourages class attendance and pushes their students to do well. It is very possible to get a 4.0 if you show up to class and put in the effort, which for some classes requires less work than others.  I gave 4/5 because of the parking situation although they are trying to improve this situation by adding across the street parking. Parking is available but you may need to walk a bit or take the shuttle from other parts of campus.

During this time, I acquired my Bachelor of Arts in Social Work while receiving a  minor in Psychological Science. One thing I noticed while enrolled at the university is that the teachers were very proactive in ensuring the best learning environment for their students. I found that the professors made themselves available to students who needed extra time outside of classroom time to process materials being taught in class. As a young African American Woman, I was further impressed by not only the diversity of the university's  faculty but also their students. Overall, my experience at CCSU was positive. The only thing I would change is for the university to be as considerate to traditional students as they are to non-traditional students as it relates to class availablity.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2018-02-02T15:20:29.113994Z","guid":"ec08d80e-79bf-40e3-b696-0782ce36de86","rating":4},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":2.66}],"photos":{"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-72.770094,41.690258,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-72.770094,41.690258,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.3884156729131174,"count":1174},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"New Britain, CT"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/central-connecticut-state-university/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"270c6db6-25a6-4b0e-b3b7-bcd9f91b3936","content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"Delaware State University","type":"College","url":"delaware-state-university"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.4065},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":12221},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"820-970"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Freshman","body":"I’m an upcoming freshman.

Everyone is connected to a very large friend group - from the people in their classes, to former or current roommates to friends of friends - and I love that! I'm a really extraverted person, so being able to make lots of connections and build relationships is something I find a lot of enjoyment in. However, I will say one of WSU's greatest downfalls is the use of Graduate Teaching Assistants (GTA) to teach an entire class. I know they'll have to one day teach a class, but a lot of the GTAs seem a little unprepared for it. Also, off the GTAs I have, some of them have even taught lecture for twenty minutes and let students go. Professors can take up the full hour with one lecture, so GTAs should be held to the same standard. In all honesty, this is just a small problem I have with WSU so far, so I hope it will change as I go forward in my degree program!","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2017-11-03T22:54:13.895863Z","guid":"3d22924d-21f9-46d1-8e96-5bad0f6904f9","rating":4},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":2.66}],"photos":{"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-97.296733,37.716484,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-97.296733,37.716484,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.586053412462908,"count":1348},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Wichita, KS"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/wichita-state-university/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"00d452e4-8982-4737-a792-aacdde63792b","content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"Crown College","type":"College","url":"crown-college"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.5413},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":21974},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"750-1020"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Junior","body":"I love Crown College.

Housing is also quite nice, even in the townhouses, which appear to be very cramped at first but are actually not too bad. The surrounding community is small and quiet, it's quite sleepy. Overall, I love this campus. \n\nFinancial aid is the main reason I chose to come to Pitt-Bradford and I can say with certainty that it was a wise decision.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2017-11-19T00:51:29.213613Z","guid":"f315aadc-0a2d-4e93-bc3f-21448f9ce4f2","rating":4},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":2.66}],"photos":{"default":{"crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/3bf4a06880367a0166a801311912c596b6c7708e.jpg","MobileHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/5c7480e501b3501bf05f3374ad8ba12ee2c3ce1f.jpg"},"licenseName":"UNLICENSED"},"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-78.673039,41.944173,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-78.673039,41.944173,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.4186046511627906,"count":516},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Bradford, PA"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/university-of-pittsburgh---bradford/#scatterplot"}}]}
