The main reasons as to why I have enjoyed Westminster the most is because of the small class sizes, typically a 20:1 ration. This allows for students to feel more connected with the professors than they would at a large University with 200+ students in one lecture hall. I also really enjoy the quality of the professors. For such a small private liberal arts college the professors are A+ material, and they really care that you succeed. I also enjoy the diversity of the students because of the fact that many international students attend the College along with study abroad programs which brings a diverse group of people from countries all around the world to small Fulton, Missouri.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2018-03-29T00:47:00.08882Z","guid":"a0f037b6-6298-4cf4-a97c-8da5790d95b9","rating":4},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":3}],"photos":{"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-91.954345,38.847764,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-91.954345,38.847764,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.7729257641921397,"count":229},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Fulton, MO"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/westminster-college---missouri/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"e2821977-d754-4dee-84fc-f8d6628c1c28","content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":true,"isPremium":false,"name":"Mary Baldwin University","type":"College","url":"mary-baldwin-university"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.9948},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":18543},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"860-1080"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Sophomore","body":"Mary Baldwin University, what could I say in order to give you a picture of campus life.
