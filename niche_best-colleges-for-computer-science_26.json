The professors are incredible and care about the students more than they care about their academic journals and whatever else professors do. They will work with you, help you, and do absolutely everything in their power to make sure you succeed. \nThe quality of education is also amazing. I've learned so much and I am actually enjoying it. Many Christian schools tend to sacrifice quality of education for making everything \"christian\", Cedarville does not do this. At Cedarville they take education seriously and teach at a high academic level.\nOver all, Cedarville is an excellent school and a great choice.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2017-12-28T19:25:28.707719Z","guid":"b62ad6e7-5668-4b9e-b726-a8dc8d8ad8d0","rating":4},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":3.33}],"photos":{"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-83.812098,39.750338,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-83.812098,39.750338,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.8205882352941174,"count":1020},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Cedarville, OH"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/cedarville-university/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"f1dc3123-ef63-4d4e-9441-17f8b3b5404f","content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"Olivet Nazarene University","type":"College","url":"olivet-nazarene-university"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.777},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":20302},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"940-1200"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Junior","body":"Olivet is a fun, caring university that creates a fantastic atmosphere all around campus. People here care and go out of their way to create relationships with you. Olivet gives you an education with a Christian purpose. There are lots of opportunities to get involved on campus outside of class. Intramurals happen year-round and are competitive and fun. Olivet puts on all-school parties/events during syllabus week and around holidays with free food and games. Olivet really caters to freshmen to make sure they have a great experience and feel like they belong. There are always plenty of jobs on and off campus as there is a pretty large community around campus. Every room comes with a Tempur-Pedic bed, making it impossible to get out of bed in the morning. High ceilings for bunking beds to create more room. After freshman year, you have an option to live off-campus in an apartment.  All rent is included in the room and board fees. All laundry is free on and off campus.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2018-05-17T15:27:58.911548Z","guid":"86e16a4d-1045-4c28-ac50-c3abc4ebc221","rating":5},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":3}],"photos":{"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-87.873654,41.155489,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-87.873654,41.155489,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.691693290734824,"count":1252},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Bourbonnais, IL"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/olivet-nazarene-university/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"115796b4-a9ea-457d-8f42-15755f0b306f","content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"Seattle Pacific University","type":"College","url":"seattle-pacific-university"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.8728},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":29174},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"990-1230"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Junior","body":"I really like the small school atmosphere of the place.

Whether it's research or internships or pursuits fo further education, proactive St. Olaf students have many resources they can take advantage of. The curriculum is tough no matter what department you take courses in. Professors have extremely high expectations for their students, however they do everything in their power to build your way to those high expectations. It can be difficult to find a study/social life balance. If you cannot develop strong study habits, classes will be a struggle. There are a ton of resources available to students who haven't established study habits and professors are happy to work with students. The open-door policy is an awesome thing to take advantage of. There can be a sense of a competitive atmosphere, but usually there is a stronger sense of community and camaraderie between students because everyone is facing many of the same challenges in an academic sense.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2017-12-29T06:15:09.010955Z","guid":"0327f163-663c-474f-aa4e-9a560bc27a1d","rating":4},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":4}],"photos":{"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-93.183633,44.462884,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-93.183633,44.462884,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.617862371888726,"count":683},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Northfield, MN"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/st-olaf-college/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"c5cb784d-182a-49bc-8594-5ee15b80be90","content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"Clark Atlanta University","type":"College","url":"clark-atlanta-university"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.7184},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":27725},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"820-970"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Niche User","body":"I recently toured this college and absolutely loved it!

They have a rigorous core curriculum and the major requirements are equally challenging. It is technically a Catholic school, but the Catholic presence is hardly felt at times. It is politically left-leaning. The professors are incredibly personable and available to help their students. That is perhaps my favorite part about the university. There is truly no greater resource to college students than having professors who care about your academic career and success. There have been countless occasions where the help or advice of a professor has totally altered my performance in a class for the better. The students are all very respectful and hard-working. The facilities are actually quite nice, with the interiors of the buildings in excellent condition.

It is a wonderful school.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2017-08-04T20:34:59.027431Z","guid":"b089a271-900c-48dd-a637-683fd42fca19","rating":5},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":3.33}],"photos":{"default":{"crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/3df8d5f54ad41058367f68551f662fbcb6ed6a57.jpg","MobileHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/b9c4a5e380742cc91e85bcd614675d78678be911.jpg"},"licenseName":"UNLICENSED"},"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-90.330452,32.334565,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-90.330452,32.334565,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.6646942800788955,"count":507},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Clinton, MS"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/mississippi-college/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"f668bff9-0793-44cd-81ea-0b66aa099485","content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"Elmhurst College","type":"College","url":"elmhurst-college"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.7189},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":18825},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"900-1170"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Junior","body":"Yes, Elmhurst College is a small school! But that is what makes Elmhurst the best college to go to! Having a small number of students in your field of program such as Elementary Education is crucial. That means there are not that many graduates from a great college looking for a job in the same area as you. You are able to build a relationship with each of your professors because the class size is about 20 students. Having a real connection with your professor means they get to know you and you get to know them. They will be great references or write great recommendations for whatever you need. In addition to professors, you create long lasting friendships with your peers. Everyone becomes close and you  support each other to get through the semester. I recommend applying to Elmhurst College first. It can be competitive to get in, but that is because they should be your number one choice!","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2017-01-20T21:53:23.668045Z","guid":"2d55ff0b-095b-48bf-8332-698f999e5716","rating":5},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":3}],"photos":{"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-87.946096,41.899215,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-87.946096,41.899215,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.5140845070422535,"count":710},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Elmhurst, IL"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/elmhurst-college/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"53018126-4d07-4227-a661-8f25be027fb5","content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"Shepherd University","type":"College","url":"shepherd-university"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.9191},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":9692},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"870-1080"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"College Senior","body":"I attend Shepherd University and fun fact it's one of the most haunted towns in America and we have a tv show. It's a small campus in a quaint town. I love the vibes and feelings while walking to class to hanging out around campus, everyone is so nice and you pass smile after smile. You really start to feel at home there because of the family you build and comfort of the town. There's lots of school spirit and fun themed days to boast moral like hot coco day, peanut butter and jelly day, Popsicle day, and so much more. There's little spots to eat around town and lots of hiking opportunities. The professors are kind and easy to talk to. The small class size is one of my favorite things because all of my professors know my name and we form a nice student teacher relationship. I would chose my school a million times over again due to the unique small town features, great professors, beautiful scenery, and school activities. You are encouraged to be yourself and have a free spirit here!","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2016-09-26T16:49:55Z","guid":"0f25791f-124c-4dd3-8783-0e59a6da2788","rating":4},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":2.66}],"photos":{"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-77.804844,39.434319,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-77.804844,39.434319,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.395498392282958,"count":622},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Shepherdstown, WV"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/shepherd-university/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"26e7b9f4-18e1-4bad-9c9e-679fa6b30212","content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":true,"isPremium":false,"name":"Concordia University - Wisconsin","type":"College","url":"concordia-university---wisconsin"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.6335},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":25764},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"898-1156"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Junior","body":"I really enjoyed and appreciated the immediate warm welcoming I received on my very first visit to the campus.

The campus is absolutely gorgeous, it has great intimate class sizes that are perfect for hands-on learning with a comfortable environment laying as its foundation, and there are so many ways to get involved with the school and its people through clubs, athletics, organizations, and all the opportunities that stem from these venues.
