There's a wide variety of students here that guarantees ease in finding friends in classes and other places on campus.  There's also so much to do every week!  JMU offers so many organizations and clubs to join as well as fun activities for the whole campus to join in on.  The reason I didn't give JMU 5 stars is because there are some small difficulties that arise for me throughout the school year. For example, it is very difficult to register for classes and get all the classes you need to satisfy graduation requirements, especially as a freshman.  Also, because JMU is a smaller campus with a growing student population, there are always very long lines for food, for example, because they cannot cater to every single student.  These are just a few examples of small problems I face on campus, but overall, I love JMU!","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2017-12-24T17:09:20.796054Z","guid":"679eb716-52a9-4dfc-b4f9-a74c15bfe27b","rating":4},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":4}],"photos":{"default":{"crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/4db870c879f0c6df1a1e3ba4ff31e994f951edad.jpg","MobileHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/3a5ac8236426e56afa157a1ec322d5838b863cae.jpg","Thumbnail":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/c349de8eee19ea6f15f0642d0d8b16418148cac0"},"licenseName":"UNLICENSED"},"mapbox_header":{"crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-78.871663,38.435332,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-78.871663,38.435332,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"UNLICENSED"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.7404946474713916,"count":2709},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Harrisonburg, VA"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/james-madison-university/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"3fd5adb3-1879-47c5-a7c7-995fc22225d1","content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"Wheaton College - Illinois","type":"College","url":"wheaton-college---illinois"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.7865},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":27840},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"1170-1400"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Alum","body":"The academic rigor and Christian atmosphere that draw most people there drew me as well.

Wheaton is sometimes called Whiteon for a reason.

Social life is lacking a bit but improving overall. It's important to get yourself out there and get involved in organizations, people I know in Greek life have also really enjoyed their experience. UTD is fairly close to Dallas and has a modern-type campus with many new buildings recently built.

People here are really active and you should have no problem finding people to hike, ski, or otherwise head off-campus with on the weekends.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2018-05-04T19:07:34.589209Z","guid":"7c863d21-92ab-4250-8642-b258baa734c9","rating":4},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":3.66}],"photos":{"default":{"crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/904e070072801d0591b19790e81cf50c4c98d082.jpg","MobileHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/1fb596220b2f64512ad8d1ef46a41e24d3e9bcc4.jpg"},"licenseName":"UNLICENSED"},"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-73.163136,44.494212,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-73.163136,44.494212,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.7388663967611335,"count":494},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Colchester, VT"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/saint-michaels-college/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"7585f171-d29e-4b07-8a6c-5cafe3579651","content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"College of Charleston","type":"College","url":"college-of-charleston"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.8413},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":18877},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"1000-1190"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Sophomore","body":"CofC is great!

Our school is known for its high recommendations for any science majors and math majors. I am a Zoology major and my best part of the university is the class where I go out of school with my class to field trip and identify different invertebrate animals near our shores. It was fun and a good leg work out too! Also, the local areas for food is quite amazing. When needing to eat besides campus food, there is a wide variety of different ethnic food here. What I like to see a change in Humboldt is to give a more housing chances for students that are from far away. More housing in the campus for everyone to be. It is tough to find an apartment or house near the school and have the housing costs to be low, for future students coming from different parts of California or an out of state transfer, they should have the opportunity to have a low-cost housing and a secure home to be in.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2018-06-04T07:47:55.941084Z","guid":"69c3f499-369e-44c2-b940-7c35a6e57796","rating":4},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":3}],"photos":{"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-124.0814,40.8741,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-124.0814,40.8741,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.5448863636363637,"count":1760},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Arcata, CA"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/humboldt-state-university/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"72a41b41-aadc-45ea-bf78-592becb4f1b7","content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":true,"isPremium":true,"name":"University of San Francisco","type":"College","url":"university-of-san-francisco"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.7137},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":35054},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"1030-1250"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Junior","body":"So far in my time at the University of San Francisco, I have been blown away by the professors.

It's incredible to be a part of a family that is nationwide. I've been on vacation, states away, and have heard the familiar greeting of \"Go Cougs!\" from passing strangers. One of the most significant things I like to boast about is how safe and clean the campus is; schools in big cities just can't compete with those aspects of WSU. And, as a young woman living across the state in a new and unfamiliar environment, I can't appreciate enough how hospitable Pullman and the WSU campus is. I'll always recommend WSU to those looking to attend college, it's truly an amazing place to pursue postsecondary education.

Upon arriving on campus, I knew this was the place i wanted to be for my collegiate career. The school is small enough that professors take interest in your activities and truly care about your success, but large enough to blend into the school if that is what you want. There are always events going on that are generally open to the students and the food at the Shoebox and Underground is simply fantastic. While it does cost a pretty penny, I believe the experiences I've had at Hanover and the connections I've made have really paid off, and that is only in my first year!","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2016-08-03T13:52:10Z","guid":"fadb3e70-2a91-438b-80e6-1063fca741e7","rating":5},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":3.66}],"photos":{"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-85.461086,38.712488,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-85.461086,38.712488,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.5264367816091955,"count":435},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Hanover, IN"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/hanover-college/#scatterplot"}}]}
