It tends to have a bad reputation, especially from where I come from, but I have nothing but great things to say about it.  Campus culture is very work oriented, many people here are ready to really earn their way to what they want to do.  Eastern is very community based, and that is shown in Ypsilanti, and the kind people around you.  Very diverse student body.  EMU tends to be too focused on the work at times, which is never a bad thing, but we could learn to relax.  You have to work to get the experience that you want.  Don't expect to pay tuition and love it - get involved, talk to your professors, do community service, look into study abroad, talk to your classmates, do research!  There is plenty there if you grab it.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2018-05-25T19:01:31.291123Z","guid":"5e5fed39-5d34-462e-9cae-0ed359833037","rating":5},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":2.66}],"photos":{"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-83.624499,42.245751,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-83.624499,42.245751,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.4503844745514463,"count":2731},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Ypsilanti, MI"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/eastern-michigan-university/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"8ec55b04-d0df-4628-b257-feb0a8924cb7","content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"Western Connecticut State University","type":"College","url":"western-connecticut-state-university"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.6683},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":17422},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"880-1080"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Senior","body":"Western Connecticut State University is a great school!

During my time I have attended numerous student life events and the students are awesome.  As far as academics go, the school offers many opportunities to choose from so I’m sure incoming students will feel at home.

The buildings look great and the mostly glass designs give off an open, chic vibe. Webb University Center, or the Webb as we call it, has 5+ eateries, a video game lobby, pool tables, and it is home to many student activities. Unlike other schools, Old Dominion allows their freshman to enjoy their college experience. We have only 1-2 visitation rules, residents don't have a curfew, and dorms are co-ed. With all this freedom, the university still makes sure our work gets done. We are given free tutoring, study rooms on every floor of every dorm, and many educational centers. To relax from the stress of school, you could party near or on campus! Safe Ride (ODU's free transportation.) will take you anywhere that isn't beyond 38th street, which most parties aren't. As you can see ODU allows you to work hard and play hard too so come join us and become a monarch!","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2018-03-08T19:29:36.308387Z","guid":"0de9741a-c19c-412d-b0e9-84030928c78c","rating":5},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":3}],"photos":{"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-76.309653,36.884919,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-76.309653,36.884919,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.5399794976934906,"count":3902},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Norfolk, VA"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/old-dominion-university/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"b84535ba-be32-4f39-acdd-4511bc675a24","content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"Westfield State University","type":"College","url":"westfield-state-university"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.7792},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":15593},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"890-1090"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Sophomore","body":"It's been very fun here meeting all the friends I have made and bring part of the track and field team as a thrower.

My favorite part of the campus has to be the student recreation center. The fitness center is my absolute favorite place to go and it is packed with any machine that you could want. Also inside the rec center is an awesome rock wall, some courts, an indoor track and a smoothie bar! I spend most of my time here and I love having it just a walking distance away from my room. So far Kutztown has been great!","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2018-02-09T23:35:07.153386Z","guid":"983dbb21-731f-4b08-bc10-387b9fe74fdc","rating":4},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":2.66}],"photos":{"default":{"crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/afd8b66b572da434133adc2760d1caed10aba446.jpg","MobileHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/07c737e157b9140f00102f72efdcc94ccd064996.jpg"},"licenseName":"UNLICENSED"},"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-75.785426,40.513705,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-75.785426,40.513705,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.4009797060881737,"count":1429},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Kutztown, PA"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/kutztown-university-of-pennsylvania/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"1a5f1fe1-079e-4a87-8e2e-f2cba9fec67a","content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"East Texas Baptist University","type":"College","url":"east-texas-baptist-university"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.5093},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":20960},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"870-1050"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Alum","body":"I enjoyed my time at ETBU. I was able to achieve a degree in a timely manor and was completely prepared for the work force after graduation. Athletics is a huge part of the student life at ETBU (was an athlete) and there is always an event to attend on the weekends. If its a hockey game, baseball, concert, or CONEXUS there is always something to do! ETBU is a family and those connections can be found even after graduation. I had a great experience as a student and love how much the campus has continued to grow! They even have full size beds in the dorms!

The teachers are great! They explain very well and teach at a moderate pace to ensure that everyone fully understands. You can also ask extra questions after class, if you wish. The classes are also small, so you have more one-on- one learning experience. It feels similar to high school, only the workload is more and the teachers are more interesting. College life is amazing, well considering this is my first time off on my own. If you want to succeed and have an awesome learning experience, St. Thomas is for you.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2017-12-02T16:24:01.788196Z","guid":"f035925e-9106-4aca-b9f8-12778a50b11c","rating":4},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":3.33}],"photos":{"default":{"crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/f0d162dc63171895b6e9be5f61b0e1147b99534d.jpg","MobileHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/9a2e6eba678549f97f5eeb402ce2216ad4e3be9e.jpg"},"licenseName":"UNLICENSED"},"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-80.256265,25.920915,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-80.256265,25.920915,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.7222222222222223,"count":342},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Miami, FL"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/st-thomas-university---florida/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"f2d7d8d5-cbc4-40e6-a893-2975645d00f3","content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"Howard Payne University","type":"College","url":"howard-payne-university"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.8772},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":19951},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"850-1050"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Freshman","body":"My experience in Howard Payne has been exactly how i pictured it.
