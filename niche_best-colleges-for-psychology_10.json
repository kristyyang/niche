It is a large, beautiful campus, but the class sizes are relatively small. Even lecture halls have under 100 students. In my time at UNCW I grew close to many professors, and even was a TA. The only downfalls to this campus were parking and wifi. I had no other negative experiences. It is a fast growing school and I wish I didn't have to leave to go to grad school (they don't have physical therapy). In-state tuition is very reasonable, and I did not end up out of college drowning in debt. Overall, I would recommend uncw to anyone.

Being in Providence means there is always something to do or new to try. While it may not be the safest city, campus security helps make PC feel like it is in its own \"bubble\". Even though the food is not the best on campus, do not feel discouraged because the food off campus is always a hit! Dorms are mostly average, some are great while some of the older buildings definitely need renovation. Athletics are a big plus to this school whether you will be playing or in the audience. The school is strongly affiliated with the Catholic faith, however, all of the professors and Dominican Friars will be welcoming of all religious backgrounds. Also, PC may be lacking in diversity but I can tell they are trying to be more inclusive, especially when it comes to clubs and organizations. Overall, a great (and expensive) school.

In addition to memories, the staff had a profound impact on me and how I carry myself to this day. Whether it be an intro class or a more fine-tuned 400-level class, each professor that has given a lecture to me has granted me the opportunity of hearing new insight and viewing the world in a fresh perspective. \n\nI resided in Ellicott Complex, which served as shelter for my first-year experience. The cleanliness and proximity to class/dining is unparalleled. My brother, another UB student, resided in Goodyear and has the same opinion as I for Ellicott.

Finally, over three years later, I now have realized my path and it has absolutely nothing to do with CSU or politics. I am sure it's a great school with tons to offer if you apply yourself, but to be honest I got very little out of my education there and feel like I may have waisted a lot of time and money during my 7 year stint at Colorado State University.

Companies consistently send representative directly to the school for seminars and job fairs with the sole purpose of finding a college student to potentially employ. Having the chance to land an internship or even get a job offer at the U of A can often be a simple as showing up to a school event! To summarize, the University of Arizona is an amazing opportunity for anyone looking to get a world-class education in an environment where employers often come directly to you.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2018-03-01T03:25:26.123698Z","guid":"092f1096-7bb8-4ba8-852f-05209f1ef07f","rating":4},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":3.66}],"photos":{"default":{"author":"iagoarchangel","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/50d9d513c48381c6ba4939908c60bbd3ac3a4631.jpg","MobileHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/0c9c05adf4b9e9ce85277fdbe92468b57d06a2e7.jpg","Thumbnail":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/375760a6d8ec09f2b2b89cb9f9f2d14e6e577f2e"},"licenseName":"CC BY-SA","licenseUrl":"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/","sourceUrl":"https://www.flickr.com/photos/iagoarchangel/8608390310/"},"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-110.950769,32.232071,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-110.950769,32.232071,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.7181506849315067,"count":5840},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Tucson, AZ"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/university-of-arizona/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"3c342441-3847-44b0-843a-71798dc38fbc","badge":{"display":"Best Colleges for Psychology in America","ordinal":254,"total":993,"vanityURL":"best-colleges-for-psychology"},"content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":true,"isPremium":true,"name":"George Fox University","type":"College","url":"george-fox-university"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.6376},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":27935},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"960-1200"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Alum","body":"Pros: The campus is pretty, academics are good, esteemed university,  and \"most\" professors are great. \nCons: Cliques, expensive, lacking diversity, shove religious views down your throat and if you don't agree your grade suffers yet the student portal is evidence of rampant drugs/sex/partying, no assistance with job placement if you are an Adult degree student, and the film program professors need to be fired - horrible favoritism, uncommunicative, arrogant, and just plain nasty!

The small classroom sizes (I've been in a class with only 4 people!) allows for 1-on-1 connections between students and professors which has helped me better understand and stay engaged with the courses and the topics of the class. \n\nOne thing to note, I never wanted to attend CBU because of how like-minded the people are. It is a conservative campus and I am a conservative and I am a political science major looking for a challenge. Although professors are usually Christian and conservative,  they put on their Marxist and liberal thinking caps and made their students think about our own views; it was a challenge after all! They really want to help you think outside of the box and become a better individual in academia and in the professional world.
