The campus is small and everything is easily accessible, no running across massive campus to get from class to class. The class sizes were small so it allowed for Professors to teach on a more personal basis. The professors were almost all  fair and excellent as well, there was only one I would complain about but is no longer employed. The people are friendly, however the population did not seem very diverse. There were plenty of places to relax or study as a commuting student, and parking spaces were not too bad to locate for the most part. Classes were challenging but practical and allowed for great preparation. I graduated with my Bachelor of Science from Lasell with great satisfaction, and I am even planning to return to Lasell for my graduate degree this coming fall.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2018-02-26T22:09:26.153315Z","guid":"e3b4a2f0-8ffd-48ea-92bb-866a5db0f0b5","rating":4},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":2.33}],"photos":{"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-71.243738,42.342712,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-71.243738,42.342712,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.413870246085011,"count":447},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Newton, MA"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/lasell-college/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"22a5900b-ae88-4148-bc58-c35bb8f187d0","content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"University of South Carolina - Beaufort","type":"College","url":"university-of-south-carolina---beaufort"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.6513},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":14592},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"840-1030"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Freshman","body":"Just from attending USC-Beaufort for one semester I have found that I love the environment on campus and off campus.

Recently, they just became the Golden Wolves after being the Crusaders for many years. They just built a brand new stadium, and added a football team. I play soccer, so I started my first year a week earlier than regular students. My team and I formed a brotherhood and share a bond like no other. We had a great season which featured playoff appearances as a team, and individually, I started every game and scored two game winning goals as a freshman. My coach put lots of faith in me. In the classroom, professors were very involved and seemed to care a lot more than typical college professors. I finished with a 3.6 GPA. The campus is beautiful and small. I know probably half of the student body. There are only two negatives about Alvernia Alvernia is the #1 school in Pennsylvania and #4 in the nation for student debt.

The majority of my professors were not only exceptionally helpful, but also available and flexible when it came to making time for students. Obviously, no place is perfect, and there were some minor butting of heads between the different schools of study within Alfred, which at times would carry into the students perceptions, but overall everyone managed to get along fairly well, regardless of major, race, gender, orientation and the such.

Overall I am very satisfied with my Oakwood Experience.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2017-07-28T16:47:35.379699Z","guid":"60794872-16eb-4164-a634-5d987d27c9ed","rating":5},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":2.33}],"photos":{"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-86.661628,34.756628,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-86.661628,34.756628,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.337404580152672,"count":1310},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Huntsville, AL"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/oakwood-university/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"8bd4768e-4754-4147-8409-c518304ee7f2","content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":true,"isPremium":false,"name":"Adams State University","type":"College","url":"adams-state-university"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.9857},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":13888},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"853-1050"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Sophomore","body":"Adams State University is a forward-thinking and progressive institution placed in a family-friendly neighborhood.

The professors are more than willing to sit down with you and break it down, piece by piece. You are not just another nameless face, you are you. Being a liberal arts college, distributions are a requirement. Though they may be an annoyance at first, they become well-rounded student shaping machines. Through these classes, you are able to educate your self of the other perceptions, cultures, and ideas along with the synthesis of your own.

The coaches are invested in their athletes and want to help them achieve their best!","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2016-10-12T12:45:08.682713Z","guid":"66b363c2-4c39-4480-b18e-9e21d70ac7d8","rating":5},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":2.66}],"photos":{"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-85.662292,40.112167,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-85.662292,40.112167,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.4991789819376025,"count":609},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Anderson, IN"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/anderson-university---indiana/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"3e396f84-b98a-45bb-9bf4-845c1c49a3e0","content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"Nebraska Wesleyan University","type":"College","url":"nebraska-wesleyan-university"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.7438},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":23540},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"950-1230"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Sophomore","body":"Nebraska Wesleyan University has a great campus, great students, and wonderful professors.  I recommend going to Nebraska Wesleyan for the small feel university.  While attending this school you will also feel the close-knit community with a big city feel of Lincoln. There is always something to do whether on campus or in Lincoln. \n\nNebraska Wesleyan has many different organizations to join from sororities and fraternities, intramurals, to other organizations. I am in International Relations Organization, this organization you interact and have fun with foreign exchange students.  We have many exchange students.
