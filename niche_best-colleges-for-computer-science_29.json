The staff are amazing; they'll invite you over to eat and talk and are always available if you have quesions. The campus itself is sort of tucked away in its own little community and has a nice feel to it. If you like the outdoors it's even better because of the 35+ miles of biking and hiking trails. There are several restaurants on campus that are worked by the students and have a wide variety of food choices. Finally, the spiritual side of Southern is beautiful. Everyone is so welcoming and always has your back. It's a big, beautiful family.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2018-05-10T17:12:58.005846Z","guid":"1f753bc3-d28a-40e8-bce2-e92cdb7accdf","rating":5},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":3}],"photos":{"default":{"crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/45cb79fe27fa02739f7ca4eb22b3a721c9ca4a45.jpg","MobileHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/d335a4b8bf95efce71fa4e813b48d3699ded5bc4.jpg"},"licenseName":"UNLICENSED"},"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-85.050878,35.049136,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-85.050878,35.049136,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.577524893314367,"count":703},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Collegedale, TN"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/southern-adventist-university/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"2301496f-5ac3-4649-94fd-2062f628c2ab","content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":true,"isPremium":false,"name":"Curry College","type":"College","url":"curry-college"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.8859},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":30581},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"840-1040"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Alum","body":"As a continuing education student pursuing a Bachelors in Nursing, it is a wonderful environment.

Their graduation rate is 98%, so there is excellent academic programs. I'm personally in the nursing program, both in the BSN and ADN. No other school would let me do both. I'm doing both to allow me to get a year of work experience before graduate school. GW encourages their students to further their education to graduate school. Additionally, GW has huge diversity within the campus. We have many students who live across the world just to come here, a lot of them for sports. Another benefit about going to GW is the security/safety. We have an actual police department on campus that consists of about eight to nine officers on call.

Everything is great about Bridgewater college, were getting a new library soon which will just add to this great school.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2018-05-02T18:12:44.431897Z","guid":"d3855fd2-912b-4f6d-af3f-f84cafb67517","rating":4},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":3}],"photos":{"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-78.969011,38.378391,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-78.969011,38.378391,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.481675392670157,"count":382},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Bridgewater, VA"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/bridgewater-college/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"17bc125d-a7ab-4df1-a556-e0e15ba2fdd1","content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"Allegheny College","type":"College","url":"allegheny-college"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.6776},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":26517},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"1050-1270"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Alum","body":"Allegheny is a hidden gem to American private liberal arts colleges. It has truly changed the ways that I interact with academics, people, and view the world. You'll build connections across disciplines while adding new, challenging, and diverse experiences from faculty, clubs, sports, music, the outdoors, art, and finding your own path. It's easy to run with a passion that you hold and just as easy to tap into the passions of others with more than 120 clubs represented on a campus of ~2000 students.

Students and professors. That liberal arts mentality of leaning for its own sake and valuing the humanities is strong here. I wish there was a film studies program so I could double major, but my experience with the English program has been excellent.  If you want to study what you love, this is a great environment for that. Academics are challenging and immersive once you get past the introductory classes, and 100 level courses are always really interesting without being overwhelming. \n\nIn terms of student life, the area is excellent. Burlington, Essex, Winooski, and Shelburne have a lot to do. People here are really active and you should have no problem finding people to hike, ski, or otherwise head off-campus with on the weekends.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2018-05-04T19:07:34.589209Z","guid":"7c863d21-92ab-4250-8642-b258baa734c9","rating":4},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":3.66}],"photos":{"default":{"crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/904e070072801d0591b19790e81cf50c4c98d082.jpg","MobileHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/1fb596220b2f64512ad8d1ef46a41e24d3e9bcc4.jpg"},"licenseName":"UNLICENSED"},"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-73.163136,44.494212,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-73.163136,44.494212,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.7388663967611335,"count":494},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Colchester, VT"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/saint-michaels-college/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"2c7d529e-2b36-4c81-867f-248df6667c0b","content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":true,"isPremium":false,"name":"Hamilton College","type":"College","url":"hamilton-college"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.2608},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":24397},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"1300-1480"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Freshman","body":"I am happier than I ever thought I could be at this school.
