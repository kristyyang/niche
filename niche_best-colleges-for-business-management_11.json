Kent State has amazing faculty and staff that I believe are truly there to help you. From custodians to our president, I have had nothing but great experiences. Our sports/recreational teams and facilities are top tear or currently being renovated to get there. Kent State is always improving and trying to be the best. Cons, being that it is such a huge university parking can be a hassle and the walking can be tiresome. There is a wide range of people there so of course a few aren't going to be the most pleasant.

Most teachers in that area did seem to care, but oftentimes I found they weren't able to teach the material quite as well as teachers in other areas. It would either be extremely difficult, with teachers going completely over my head, or very, very easy, with the teacher practically going back to basic high school math. It'd be nice to see some more focus on that area and to see it improve some.\nBut overall, this college has a very welcoming and warm environment and I'd recommend it to anyone looking for a good start to college.

I am going into my sophomore year of college, and I was so excited to come back! It is home to me. The small class sizes allow me to get to know more students and my professors on a first-name basis. There is not much that I would recommend they change. This school is a great choice!","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2017-08-24T21:47:27.122833Z","guid":"af8d9b90-22d3-41c7-8d93-a9c8ffa8388d","rating":5},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":3.33}],"photos":{"default":{"crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/4ee59484a8476f4c9d3eba19794f18f9d745bc0d.jpg","MobileHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/4e7e966d03be649dd3fcaa9133304aaa56752482.jpg"},"licenseName":"UNLICENSED"},"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-96.166319,43.08396,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-96.166319,43.08396,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.4690026954177897,"count":371},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Sioux Center, IA"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/dordt-college/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"c5aa5e04-2d3a-45bd-8e83-4df976f79700","badge":{"display":"Best Colleges for Business in America","ordinal":289,"total":1020,"vanityURL":"best-colleges-for-business"},"content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":true,"isPremium":false,"name":"Hope College","type":"College","url":"hope-college"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.8441},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":27734},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"1000-1270"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Sophomore","body":"I am an international student. In Hope College, it seems like they do really care whether or not you are in Hope College! The school tries to make your life and transition to USA comfortable and smooth. People are so nice here in Holland MI. Because it is a smaller school, there are lots of opportunity but still big enough to have connections and make networks. We have a great science department and our Chemistry is one of the best among the liberal arts college. There are lots of opportunity for research too. There is an open door policy for professors so you can go in and ask anytime! Also our school is a dry campus and we take pride in that!","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2017-09-27T20:17:40.337614Z","guid":"70a19249-dce7-4dde-a34c-e10ca789f8fc","rating":5},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":3.66}],"photos":{"default":{"crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/fa8dd306587ac01eddc3232a0968fe16a43b03c3.jpg","MobileHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/7d93bc86777665d4ba9e3cf002acd66e34f17116.jpg"},"licenseName":"UNLICENSED"},"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-86.105376,42.788052,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-86.105376,42.788052,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.6886291179596173,"count":941},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Holland, MI"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/hope-college/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"ada7d3b1-b9c5-41cd-ad95-bddb87711e19","badge":{"display":"Best Colleges for Business in America","ordinal":290,"total":1020,"vanityURL":"best-colleges-for-business"},"content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"Oregon State University","type":"College","url":"oregon-state-university"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.7748},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":19484},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"990-1240"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Niche User","body":"The Public Health and Human Services department at Oregon State University was wonderful.
