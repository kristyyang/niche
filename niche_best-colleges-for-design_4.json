Professors vary from each other; since the university is a research university (and they take pride over that), your professors will vary from individual to individual. It's not surprising if your professor is super smart but horrible in teaching. You really have to fight for yourself here in studying, but that's not saying there aren't good Professors at all - there are! Emphasis on Professors because sometimes that's just what'll make or break your happiness for that quarter or so.\n\nThat being said, it's also not surprising to question your tuition here if it's worth it or not.

Queens is a very small campus, it'll take you 5 minutes to walk to the farthest part on campus! The student body closely resembles that of the size of a high school (2,500-3,000) students. Queens is also a liberal arts school so here we focus a lot on the arts and you are required to take some arts courses because of this, but I loved it; it broadened my knowledge and forced me to take courses that I may not have taken otherwise. Because of the size of the school the ratio of professor to student is along the lines of 1:17, which is great because you are NOT known as just a number here, you are an individual that the Professor actually gets to know. It makes your experience better when you know that your Professor cares about you. If you enjoy truly being known on campus, small school/classes then Queens is the perfect fit for you!","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2017-03-27T23:30:42.679889Z","guid":"a05c4c87-4b5d-4d91-9c11-812f8209a19c","rating":4},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":3}],"photos":{"default":{"crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/4fcc168cf25c5c1ce850a03e16eb34c08a05786f.jpg","MobileHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/ddfa9942ddbe15172598d426c373c5f431b04ca4.jpg"},"licenseName":"UNLICENSED"},"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-80.832227,35.188929,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-80.832227,35.188929,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.579520697167756,"count":459},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Charlotte, NC"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/queens-university-of-charlotte/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"72509911-ac79-48cd-8613-0dfbe6eb2d3d","badge":{"display":"Best Colleges for Design in America","ordinal":102,"total":244,"vanityURL":"best-colleges-for-design"},"content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"University of the Arts","type":"College","url":"university-of-the-arts"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.7679},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":33394},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"910-1140"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Freshman","body":"I am a current UArts freshmen Dance Major, so my opinions are biased towards the school.\nHere's some of my opinions on the school:\n-Literally in the heart of Philadelphia (S Broad Street/ Center City)\n-Terra Hall, Gershman Gym, Anderson Hall, Hamilton Hall, & the dorm buildings all on or close to S Broad Street\n-Terra Hall contains 17 floors pertaining to The Arts!

Finally, over three years later, I now have realized my path and it has absolutely nothing to do with CSU or politics. I am sure it's a great school with tons to offer if you apply yourself, but to be honest I got very little out of my education there and feel like I may have waisted a lot of time and money during my 7 year stint at Colorado State University.

It's been an amazing experience so far and I can't wait to spend the next three years here! The professors are incredible and care about the students more than they care about their academic journals and whatever else professors do. They will work with you, help you, and do absolutely everything in their power to make sure you succeed. \nThe quality of education is also amazing. I've learned so much and I am actually enjoying it. Many Christian schools tend to sacrifice quality of education for making everything \"christian\", Cedarville does not do this. At Cedarville they take education seriously and teach at a high academic level.\nOver all, Cedarville is an excellent school and a great choice.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2017-12-28T19:25:28.707719Z","guid":"b62ad6e7-5668-4b9e-b726-a8dc8d8ad8d0","rating":4},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":3.33}],"photos":{"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-83.812098,39.750338,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-83.812098,39.750338,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.8205882352941174,"count":1020},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Cedarville, OH"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/cedarville-university/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"1e8f6bd2-1d23-4bba-992b-165f20d1def2","content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":true,"isPremium":false,"name":"University of Houston","type":"College","url":"university-of-houston"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.5854},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":15571},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"1040-1250"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Freshman","body":"Amazing university.

Western has really allowed me to get out my comfort zone and expand with the variety of different people, clubs, and organizations. Western has tons of opportunities to help you grow as a student and into an adult. There are so many Registered Student Organizations (RSO) on campus. I love that being a student on campus you can voice your opinions and feel comfortable doing so. There are places on campus for the LGBT community to go and feel safe!
