The curriculum is varied, interesting and is engineered to maximize the character and well roundedness of its students. This quality of academic achievement is made possible only by an attentive and caring faculty of professors, many of which are expert in their respective fields. Student life at the university is also exceptional. All incoming students are welcomed warmly. The helpfulness of the staff is remarkable considering the fact that each professor is ready and willing to sit one on one with students for discussion. One shortcoming of the university, however, is that, even with its veritable course selection, it offers but one foreign language, that being Spanish.

This life is not desirable to everyone as cadets are taught to march, wear uniforms, disassemble rifles, and properly prepare for uniform inspections. Many of the operations that take place on campus are cadet run and supervised  by Cadet rank holders.  Responsibility is delegated through cadet officers, and NCOs and most importantly students are given a firm education in leadership.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2017-05-14T02:58:17.440418Z","guid":"bbbe7033-6145-4010-9f9a-532be86e693e","rating":4},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":3.33}],"photos":{"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-79.961399,32.796975,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-79.961399,32.796975,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.659217877094972,"count":358},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Charleston, SC"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/citadel-military-college-of-south-carolina/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"d0f99d70-e991-434a-a22b-d01ba983143d","badge":{"display":"Best Colleges for Criminal Justice in America","ordinal":45,"total":484,"vanityURL":"best-colleges-for-criminal-justice"},"content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"Chaminade University of Honolulu","type":"College","url":"chaminade-university-of-honolulu"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.9133},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":18660},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"870-1060"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Sophomore","body":"Chaminade University of Honolulu has small class, so you can get your questions answered.

Pom poms shake throughout Bryant Denny Stadium and each spectator is completely invested in Alabama's sports teams. Moving 18 hours away from home was extremely nerve-racking but Alabama could not feel more like home. The amount of scholarship offered to out-of-state students is amazing and helps combat the high cost.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2018-04-10T19:02:12.236272Z","guid":"040f2331-f244-42bf-9627-e453172c9bff","rating":5},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":4}],"photos":{"default":{"crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/72d468d49a692298481d0fd444598807a8e348ce.jpg","MobileHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/e8b3f3c3a38131d336c2949319f659484199b5ba.jpg"},"licenseName":"UNLICENSED"},"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-87.545766,33.2144,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-87.545766,33.2144,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.8969047038752134,"count":4103},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Tuscaloosa, AL"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/the-university-of-alabama/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"d3866e88-49fd-47ad-a8bc-6b74f86b9c33","badge":{"display":"Best Colleges for Criminal Justice in America","ordinal":53,"total":484,"vanityURL":"best-colleges-for-criminal-justice"},"content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":true,"isPremium":false,"name":"Saint Louis University","type":"College","url":"saint-louis-university"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.6474},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":33222},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"1110-1330"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Sophomore","body":"As a current sophomore at Saint Louis University, I want to preface by saying that I could not see myself at any other university. SLU is an extremely open college where you will meet people from diverse backgrounds who have different experiences. Of course, people will always complain and say that the \"rich white people\" surround SLU. However, if you actually try and engage in the SLU community you will find more than just that. SLU has given me life long friends and an education that I am proud of. So far my classes have gone well and are usually well taught. If there are any complaints, there are always surveys at the end of the semester that go straight to the department heads for review. Finding the right college for you is difficult. I was lucky enough to fall in love with SLU as soon as I visited. I definitely suggest visiting and doing an overnight to see if SLU is right for you.
