As far as academics go, the school offers many opportunities to choose from so I’m sure incoming students will feel at home. Moreover, the professors are friendly and really want you to succeed, so if you’re the type that worries about not having individual attention, no need to worry here because the class ratio is perfect for that matter.

I took out loans the first two years, but received a full-ride the last two years.\nAbout 90% of my profess were intellectually stimulating and very friendly. They welcome students during office hours and actually want to see you succeed. The advisors are the BEST! They are very supportive. The business career center is a great asset of UIC. The advisors help students find internships and full-time jobs after graduation.\nOverall, I would rate UIC a 8.2/10.

If money is a concern for you, I would strongly consider applying and seeing what scholarships you earn, because that was the deciding factor for me when I was in high school. Social life is lacking a bit but improving overall. It's important to get yourself out there and get involved in organizations, people I know in Greek life have also really enjoyed their experience. UTD is fairly close to Dallas and has a modern-type campus with many new buildings recently built. Campus food is excellent now with many options, there is also a full Starbucks store on campus. \n\nOverall, UTD is actually a great school that focuses on academics but has also improved in many other areas recently.

I could not have survived the first semester at Hiram without the help of my professors for sure.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2017-12-06T23:12:39.35875Z","guid":"a14d0b60-4ea5-4b82-a6c1-21254b444595","rating":4},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":2.66}],"photos":{"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-81.141552,41.310998,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-81.141552,41.310998,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.308270676691729,"count":399},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Hiram, OH"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/hiram-college/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"ae4f33c6-3e0d-4015-96f6-9f94f2bbd789","badge":{"display":"Best Colleges in America","ordinal":676,"total":1644,"vanityURL":"best-colleges"},"content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"California State University - Stanislaus","type":"College","url":"california-state-university---stanislaus"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.7434},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":7557},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"810-1030"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Freshman","body":"I love the space between the buildings of each of the classes because it provides a lovely break from being trapped in a room all morning.

I love the shade provided on the campus, but I do think there should be more of it, especially with the heat and vigor the sun gives during the summer months of Turlock. Perhaps each graduating class could plant a tree to help promote saving the environment, and make a positive impact as they face the world outside of college!

From the looks of my room, I believed i would've had the best college experience ever.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2017-03-09T22:06:22.973548Z","guid":"a274f32e-17b9-41f2-a37f-9c1828519a9f","rating":5},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":2.33}],"photos":{"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-78.88067,42.934199,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-78.88067,42.934199,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.412650602409639,"count":1328},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Buffalo, NY"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/suny-buffalo-state-college/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"0afd2fe5-ca86-4d44-bc1f-ac61c84fce5b","badge":{"display":"Best Colleges in America","ordinal":749,"total":1644,"vanityURL":"best-colleges"},"content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"Old Dominion University","type":"College","url":"old-dominion-university"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.8464},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":15218},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"890-1130"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Sophomore","body":"Despite its old age, ODU is a very modern, vibrant, and blooming campus. The buildings look great and the mostly glass designs give off an open, chic vibe. Webb University Center, or the Webb as we call it, has 5+ eateries, a video game lobby, pool tables, and it is home to many student activities. Unlike other schools, Old Dominion allows their freshman to enjoy their college experience. We have only 1-2 visitation rules, residents don't have a curfew, and dorms are co-ed. With all this freedom, the university still makes sure our work gets done. We are given free tutoring, study rooms on every floor of every dorm, and many educational centers. To relax from the stress of school, you could party near or on campus! Safe Ride (ODU's free transportation.) will take you anywhere that isn't beyond 38th street, which most parties aren't. As you can see ODU allows you to work hard and play hard too so come join us and become a monarch!","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2018-03-08T19:29:36.308387Z","guid":"0de9741a-c19c-412d-b0e9-84030928c78c","rating":5},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":3}],"photos":{"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-76.309653,36.884919,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-76.309653,36.884919,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.5399794976934906,"count":3902},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Norfolk, VA"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/old-dominion-university/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"5efd3575-e136-48cc-a461-6f278c3beb5f","content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"Hampton University","type":"College","url":"hampton-university"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.6482},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":24377},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"860-1040"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Sophomore","body":"Through my freshman year at Hampton University, I have learned that in order to enact change is like pulling teeth. The administration has been intact for some 40 years, therefore it is very difficult to get things such as food quality, dorm maintenance, and events to change for the better. Although this year was a very academically rigorous year, it did lack in other areas. In the aforementioned areas, students had to organize a sit in protest in order to have our voices and concerns addressed. Academically speaking, Hampton University is not lacking at all, well, at least in my experience. All of my professors were professional, thorough, and cared about the well being and academic journey of their students. Entering my sophomore year, I look forward to how this illustrious institution will grow, or decline!","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2018-05-18T18:54:22.157176Z","guid":"ae3e8cc6-c609-4a16-ae37-ca3c5f628c1a","rating":4},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":2.66}],"photos":{"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-76.337647,37.022084,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-76.337647,37.022084,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.189840944073884,"count":1949},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Hampton, VA"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/hampton-university/#scatterplot"}}]}
