Cannot beat the small class sizes and professor attention. Coming from Rutgers university i really appreciate that. Not as cutthroat as rutgers or other schools. I also actually like that each professor takes attendance and counts it as ten percent or more, of your grade. This encourages class attendance and pushes their students to do well. It is very possible to get a 4.0 if you show up to class and put in the effort, which for some classes requires less work than others.  I gave 4/5 because of the parking situation although they are trying to improve this situation by adding across the street parking. Parking is available but you may need to walk a bit or take the shuttle from other parts of campus. I also received 150$ cougar dollars because i was taking a saturday course which is awesome and very helpful for a broke college students!","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2017-10-08T21:38:46.586276Z","guid":"d6dc4cb1-4607-4bec-83c2-53169838cc8f","rating":4},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":2.66}],"photos":{"default":{"crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/859a4d9d0796621f891ab53ccda6c6fd903ed3a4.jpg","MobileHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/f07fa8da1eafb01ef2100eaac2340260ff021fcc.jpg"},"licenseName":"UNLICENSED"},"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-74.234668,40.679429,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-74.234668,40.679429,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.5614320585842147,"count":1229},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Union, NJ"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/kean-university/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"1128c680-a792-4e35-a832-b7b15db33cd9","content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"Upper Iowa University","type":"College","url":"upper-iowa-university"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.5555},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":23405},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"860-880"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Sophomore","body":"Everyone from financial aide to the advisers have been amazing and super helpful!

There seems to be a lack of diversity however everyone seems to be openly accepting and quite happy. Tuition seems to be reasonable with such new and up to day renovations and technology. The school itself has a very modern look and gives the overall hospital feeling in a transparent way. Most of all the staff has gone to Lancaster General College, worked for their hospital, and has returned to teach and have been beyond successful doing so. This college has a very, very high rate of occupational placement within six months of graduating.

Teachers organize movie nights, talent shows, bowling, and much more. Silver Lake College is a small campus, it was what I was looking for. I was looking for a small college because professors sit with you one on one and there are more opportunities for them to help you and that's what Silver Lake professors do. Within the college there are also sports and other school activities. I have recently joined  the cheer team and I really enjoy participating.

The culture here is very friendly and despite me working part-time here, all my 'customers' are nice and friendly and very patient with New comers! The teachers you meet show that they actually put genuine thought and belief into the subject that they teach, unlike most Highschools you recently get out of.

A lot of work is required, but I'm sure that goes for any university. There are students of all ages. The parking is TERRIBLE. The school has purchased all parking anywhere near the school and parking permits are needed everywhere. I tried to buy a parking permit but there were no more available. So I was forced to walk a mile to classes, and even still had to pay at parking meters. I didn't mind the walk, but sometimes could not find parking. Another thing I didn't appreciate is that there are no places where I could pump my breast milk, since I am a breastfeeding momma. I always had to pump in restrooms which seemed unsanitary and quite frankly stinky at times. My adviser has been great! She is very helpful.

All the professors are wonderful and really know how to teach vs just read off a PowerPoint. I felt safe on campus everyday. I did take biology anantomy and psychiology and that was the only class I would say is really tough because the professor only reads off a PowerPoint and nothing she says is on her tests, but every other class was awesome. If you can take a class with Eric Ash you will love it! Places around campus to eat at we’re all decently priced and great food. I commuted so I’m not sure how on campus food is. Don’t buy a parking pass. Load money on your one card and pay that way it will save you money.
