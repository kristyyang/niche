Class sizes are normally small enough that professors can talk to and interact with students on a one-on-one basis to answer questions, to provide assistance, to facilitate conversation, and to even assist with opportunities. With more than seventy individual majors and the opportunities to earn multiple majors, students definitely have not only variety but choice to maximize the opportunities afforded to them to achieve their dreams. The Office of Undergraduate Research has been instrumental in allowing students to travel, to present research, and network, and students are often more than prepared to attend graduate schools and to fill the vacant job and/or leadership positions available after college.

The professors here are okay, the reason why is they are very close-minded and authoritative. You cannot question their judgment, and they are not open to new ideas. The campus buildings and dorms are kept clean and updated - which is a huge plus to recompense their weaknesses. The student life here is dull since most people are commuters and the students only hang around with people from their high school. The food here is from good to average in some days. Finally, the academics here is excellent since it has tons of academic variations along with professors that are passionate about their specialized field.

It is very possible to get a 4.0 if you show up to class and put in the effort, which for some classes requires less work than others.  I gave 4/5 because of the parking situation although they are trying to improve this situation by adding across the street parking.

I find that CSULA is very safety-conscious, maintains an excellent campus environment and student life, and hires very impressive and motivated professors who instill knowledge and their own passions into the students they teach. However, if there are two aspects that I would like to see CSULA improve on, they would be the local area and campus food. I would appreciate it if there were interesting activities to participate in in the local area and if there was a much bigger variety of healthy food choices aside from the food trucks and the food court.

I am taking my experiences working alongside my peers in the school newspaper \"State Press\" and student outreach \"Programming and Activities Board\" to learn valuable work ethics for future career skills. As a medical studies major, I still find it important to surround myself with other activities and involvements that are not related to my major. Therefore, the school paper gives me sense of the journalism world and the PAB allows me to explore skills in marketing and event planning. Overall, my experience at ASU change my life and improved my skills that pertains to social, professional, and personal life skills. Thank you ASU for everything!","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2018-01-24T19:58:06.40284Z","guid":"b0829592-6519-421e-be8b-f15c515bfb8b","rating":4},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":4}],"photos":{"default":{"crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/d2a991a5e5520795b6d7595f0d94a65d29506ebf.jpg","MobileHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/f78badc29772f1e731fba83e2eb9065ee1ee66e5.jpg"},"licenseName":"UNLICENSED"},"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-111.940011,33.421922,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-111.940011,33.421922,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.6734143049932526,"count":9633},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Tempe, AZ"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/arizona-state-university/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"c52d86cf-9ed3-461c-9aba-b7f10673c5cc","content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"University of North Texas","type":"College","url":"university-of-north-texas"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.7179},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":10424},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"980-1200"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Junior","body":"I have now attended UNT for almost 3 years now. What drew to the school was   its affordability, as well as, the diversity. The campus includes a broad range of students, but even though many are from different backgrounds, the campus has the ability of bringing everyone together. While living on campus, I have never felt more safe, safety is a top priority for the school and I am proud to call myself an eagle. The resources available on school are simply amazing, so you should never feel behind on anything course related. For the future, I am considering on continuing with a graduate academic career in the near future at UNT.

I'm a film and television major at NYU Tisch, and I am having the time of my life. All of my professors have been so inspiring and they actually take an interest in you and what your strengths and weaknesses are. Tisch has given me so much valuable experience on student sets and in class that I am sure I could not have received anywhere else. There are so many classes to choose from in every aspect of filmmaking, which gives students so many skills that can be marketable when looking for a job after graduation. The internship coordinator is amazing as well, as many of my friends and I have found our internships through him.

The weather is wonderful; we have all four seasons. Flagstaff is especially great if you enjoy the outdoors since we're close to the Grand Canyon and other national parks. The instructors are wonderful (that I've had) and they take the time to get to know their students. Academically, if you take the time to study and communicate with your instructors then it's not too difficult. There are also a lot of academic resources (for free) that NAU provides for their students to succeed in their classes. Overall, NAU is a solid university to attend and I'm glad that I picked it.
