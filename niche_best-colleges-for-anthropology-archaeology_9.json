There's acres of college woods too!\nMost on-campus dorms represent a theme so that everyone can feel like they belong. \nThe courses are hard-professors expect you to study out of class, but they have office hours and are willing to stay after class with you.\nCFAR helps you find study plans, discover what kind of learner you are, and figure out how to tackle difficult classes. There's free tutoring if needed\nUNH works with most study abroad programs. It's discovery credit system makes it easy for credits to transfer towards your major. \nFor food It's in the top 1% of USA. There's 3 dining halls as well as shops all around campus. It's unbelievable(trust me on this)\nD1 Aka sports events are crazy. Football/hockey is intense; there's huge tailgate parties\nGreek life and sports teams have their own houses so the parties are good.\nSo many clubs/orgs.

My professors so far are amazing and accommodating, and I adore the classes despite some of them being difficult.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2018-02-02T03:57:32.480614Z","guid":"2b7e0093-623b-4d85-ba8b-bd2e7e408db3","rating":5},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":3.33}],"photos":{"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-89.33791,31.327499,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-89.33791,31.327499,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.662516382699869,"count":1526},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Hattiesburg, MS"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/university-of-southern-mississippi/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"ca9e78bf-8de1-4bd5-bf56-44aaa482e523","content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":true,"isPremium":false,"name":"CUNY Brooklyn College","type":"College","url":"cuny-brooklyn-college"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.3749},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":9771},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"1010-1200"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Junior","body":"Going to Brooklyn College was the best decision I ever made.

There are plenty of programs that are there to help if you are struggling outside and inside of the school. There are also rewards for students who maintain a GPA of 3.0 and above as well as programs that recognizes students who are not quite at the 3.0 mark bug still shows their ambition to succeed.

Every semester the school creates a new way to include its students from all walks of life. There are many organizations that are eager to gain new recruits; there are always emails and chalk drawings that invite people to join the UMBC community or show your Retriever Pride; and there are so many safe, private places to study or just relax without feeling like you're in the middle of nowhere.\nNot to mention you are a short bus-ride away from plenty of off-campus attractions, if you ever feel the need to escape campus life (many of these excursions are even organized by  the Student Events Board). \nThis is the perfect small campus, with a big college feel. I highly recommend going here.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2018-02-28T21:11:50.413584Z","guid":"5cd42f0d-d5f9-4239-9993-d85b27f54680","rating":4},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":3.33}],"photos":{"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-76.711607,39.256686,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-76.711607,39.256686,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.456090651558074,"count":1765},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Baltimore, MD"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/university-of-maryland---baltimore-county/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"efd24293-d300-4f65-93e9-dbb7b1b981ba","content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":true,"isPremium":false,"name":"East Tennessee State University","type":"College","url":"east-tennessee-state-university"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.9164},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":14915},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"920-1130"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Senior","body":"Overall, I have been impressed with the type of experiences I have been able to receive at East Tennessee State University. As I am studying to be a future teacher, I have had many opportunities to work with young students at the University School on campus. This has allowed me to gain experience with students by actually doing my lesson plans with real students. Almost all of my professors have been enthusiastic and passionate about the content they have been teaching, which creates a more engaging classroom. The campus has many different options for food and entertainment, with weekly emails about upcoming events. With over 200 student clubs and organizations, there are plenty of opportunities to get involved on campus, make friends, and develop new skills!","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2018-05-04T19:30:36.560392Z","guid":"8736eb2d-2c3e-4a1a-a1d5-f91d959a02b0","rating":4},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":2.66}],"photos":{"default":{"crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/234b885f667940d55c4cf97c66c68ac986caabfd.jpg","MobileHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/c4bbcc2a986339b80984764a6cfea7a03ed13430.jpg"},"licenseName":"UNLICENSED"},"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-82.366954,36.301643,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-82.366954,36.301643,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.598621877691645,"count":1161},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Johnson City, TN"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/east-tennessee-state-university/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"48d72fb8-4653-464c-b8c0-9abf7155081a","content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"Troy University","type":"College","url":"troy-university"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.9125},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":10283},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"925-1160"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Sophomore","body":"It is a fun beautiful and safe campus with great diversity in the student body.  The clubs and organizations are welcoming and always have a project going--which non-members are always welcome to participate in.  Football is big in the south so game day is always a must.  One of personal favorite experiences of my time at Troy was watching the band (we have an AMAZING band).  My housing (Trojan Village) was fantastic!  As with any college, it has its share of issues--parking is a big one--sometimes you will hear uncomfortable stories about the older dorms and every once an a while someone would get something gross at the dining hall but these few slips are to be expected anywhere.  As far as academics my classes are small, personal, and most of my teachers are beyond great.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2018-04-02T21:55:59.407644Z","guid":"82779b0d-b2cc-4f6b-bd37-94a1b428e898","rating":5},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":3}],"photos":{"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-85.950191,31.800128,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-85.950191,31.800128,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.6317626527050613,"count":1719},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Troy, AL"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/troy-university/#scatterplot"}}]}
