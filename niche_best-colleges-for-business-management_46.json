The academics are optimal and require professionalism and the programs expect high quality, to their best effort out of the students. The community is very open and willing to help anybody. Lyndon gives the opportunity for students to be an athlete while having their main focus on school then sports after.

I will be a junior Fall 2018. It is the most diverse campus I've stepped foot on. All of my professors are great and actually cares about each individual student. The falculty is wonderful. There are so many opportunities that Huston-Tillotson University offers their students. If I could change anything, it would probably be the size of the dorms. They're very small rooms shared by 2 people. The temperature is almost never right, either too hot or too cold. But other than that, I believe there is nothing else I would change about my HBCU. I love it here and can't wait to give back.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2018-05-29T17:39:46.534573Z","guid":"4c85e3b6-282f-4118-8a85-08c4742aeaf0","rating":4},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":2}],"photos":{"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-97.721698,30.264672,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-97.721698,30.264672,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.4952380952380953,"count":420},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Austin, TX"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/huston-tillotson-university/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"2f4db4c0-cf93-49af-b39b-084316855e0e","content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"Dickinson State University","type":"College","url":"dickinson-state-university"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.9171},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":11286},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"850-1200"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Freshman","body":"This is actually a very small university with about 4000 students including online.

From the time I enrolled into LeMoyne-Owen College has been great. People say I'm a walking billboard for the school, because I always have some apparel with LOC on it. I love my school, it has molded me to become a better woman in today's society.  From school organizations to school sports has been a joy","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2017-12-29T03:33:34.336274Z","guid":"b3b26bd4-8c91-4c72-847e-0eec1376e517","rating":5},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":1.66}],"photos":{"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-90.034101,35.118641,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-90.034101,35.118641,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.7125,"count":80},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Memphis, TN"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/lemoyne-owen-college/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"43e479bb-ad14-4ae9-96c5-ae4eaf01ced3","content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"Lourdes University","type":"College","url":"lourdes-university"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.8934},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":19635},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"860-1100"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Niche User","body":"If i have ever loved a school so much! To be such a new and advancing University, the housing is literally an apartment complex. Also, there are so many options for people to do. There are so many opportunities for working, volunteering, traveling, and simply being involved. The LEAP crew hosts free programs like going to Lions games or Cedar Point. Also stuff like glow parties. I still have my TShirt from my freshman year of 2012. The RAs are very attentive. Jets has the greatest enployees and they help the students. There is always something going on in the Den. There is also an open door policy. If there is a door open, walk into it and say Hello!. I also love the FYE course. It encourages freshmen students to get involved with the school and to attened different events. They even take you camping for orientation which was 4 days of awesome. I Love Lourdes University...HOME OF THE GREY WOLVES.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2017-04-26T22:36:18.850894Z","guid":"481c3798-b891-43ab-9222-73a90b918f27","rating":5},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":2.33}],"photos":{"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-83.706649,41.708694,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-83.706649,41.708694,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.7494505494505495,"count":455},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Sylvania, OH"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/lourdes-university/#scatterplot"}}]}
