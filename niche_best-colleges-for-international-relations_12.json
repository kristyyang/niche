I've had an excellent experience so far and am thrilled that I chose this university. I love the small class sizes and the relationships that you are able to form with your professors. I also love the atmosphere of the school, and the fact that you can see people you know all the time. It's also great that you can always find a place to fit in. There's something for everyone if you seek it out. Additionally, I have been blessed with fantastic work and internship opportunities from this school, which are extremely valuable. However, athletics are not a huge priority for the school, which is slightly a bummer. I am an athlete at Chapman and I would definitely love to see more student support of athletics. What's great is that the student athletes and athletic directors have been very proactive about this. They are working hard to draw more support for all teams and make athletics more inclusive. Overall, Chapman is an excellent university and I am proud to be a student!","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2017-06-07T18:03:56.544528Z","guid":"601a0872-151f-456b-808d-39227c94c6dc","rating":4},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":3.66}],"photos":{"default":{"crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/f07e4f95104cdd5544640486d187493d525f8ebd.jpg","MobileHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/0152149fb7684443dadb5750fe110b118dcae5ab.jpg"},"licenseName":"UNLICENSED"},"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-117.853,33.7933,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-117.853,33.7933,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.6210840377921434,"count":2011},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Orange, CA"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/chapman-university/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"709c9868-25cf-40d4-b94e-b2420a0dbbc6","content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"Morehead State University","type":"College","url":"morehead-state-university"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.8556},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":11296},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"840-1060"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Freshman","body":"I really do love this college but there are some downfalls to the way things work. They have a tutoring center but sometimes even the tutors aren't sure how to help you and that can be really frustrating. I live in a form and I have to say, there are some RAs who seem to be a little too into your personal life and it doesn't always feel like there's much privacy. I am unable to go home on weekends so I have spent time looking for things to do on and around campus but there really isn't much to ever do. The problem I have with the food is sometimes you find hair, my hair is very very short so I know a really long hair can't be mine. I have noticed lots of the workers don't wear hair nets when they're handling the food. Overall I do love this college but there are some improvements that need to be made.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2018-03-22T15:58:37.931146Z","guid":"00cc191d-d7d3-4349-a3be-25ec30968743","rating":4},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":2.66}],"photos":{"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-83.429742,38.188462,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-83.429742,38.188462,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.5422314911366004,"count":959},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Morehead, KY"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/morehead-state-university/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"8a8c50fd-2a3b-45ea-9e86-c0d7e60bf252","content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":true,"isPremium":true,"name":"Southern Utah University","type":"College","url":"southern-utah-university"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.7228},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":14024},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"890-1150"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Senior","body":"I love this school!

However, I’ve noticed the freshman student body is  more diverse than I expected and the school is not as big as I thought. I see many of the people in my hall around campus. The class sizes are small 15-25 students. The city of Oneonta is cute and transportation to the mall and other main spots is easily accessible. The RA’s are always there to help me with anything big or small. The freshman dorms seem to be the newest! The food is okay, it’s not moms cooking but there’s a lot of selections and 3 main dining halls around campus. Professors have overall been very supportive and helpful.

Shuttles that run every 20 minutes, so getting from main campus to downtown is not that hard. The problem is that sometimes drivers are late, they leave early, and some shuttles are too small to hold everyone. Security wise, there are emergency telephones around campus, and campus police drives around occasionally. I had a fantastic stay in the hotel-like freshman dorm, Clearview Hall. Too bad sleeping in the same room as your roommate is the only option. When I became a sophomore, I was upset with the rundown housing in Courtyard South/One. I will be moving to Courtyard North next semester and it is way better! I am not a big fan of the foods, but some days are better than others. The cafe is buffet style with a salad bar, pizza, hibachi, \"main event\", and desserts; they server different things for breakfast, lunch, and dinner.

The campus is a very inviting environment; there are always events going on whether it is sports, diversity, or arts. The professors give off a warm, caring  aroma. No student should be afraid to ask for help from their professor; they are always willing whether it is through office hours or email. MSUM offers many ways to help students succeed; from tutoring to the Wellness Center for physical health. The campus is just the right size, not too small yet not overwhelming as well. As soon as I visited MSUM my senior year of high school, I knew it was home. Though, what I would like to see change is the exclusion from some activities held on campus. For example, they have activities that exclude some students from clubs or learning communities. I wish for more equality in allowing all students to be involved. Otherwise, I believe MSUM is a great place full of opportunities for students to further their education.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2017-11-26T05:07:52.397844Z","guid":"0ece1c33-a37d-4bed-abe0-cadcfc074cbc","rating":4},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":3}],"photos":{"default":{"crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/db9b3a0ff27f272424f505083bf388c9377f84cd.jpg","MobileHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/9579f183666104e0e7185a4591a4b5f6878c5147.jpg"},"licenseName":"UNLICENSED"},"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-96.763376,46.866482,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-96.763376,46.866482,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.4360795454545454,"count":704},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Moorhead, MN"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/minnesota-state-university-moorhead/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"7099c1c4-b34b-4969-9434-226a0a3a3933","content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"Bradley University","type":"College","url":"bradley-university"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.6981},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":26773},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"960-1240"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Senior","body":"Bradley, being a smaller school than a state school, allows students the opportunity to more easily connect with professors in a meaningful way.

Its diverse range of students encourages students to interact with cultures different from their own and encourages inclusivity and acceptance of everyone irregardless of their background.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2018-05-15T05:55:34.403671Z","guid":"e757e9ed-1775-41b8-bfe7-c1505de995b2","rating":5},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":2.66}],"photos":{"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-98.51774,33.877143,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-98.51774,33.877143,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.6164241164241164,"count":962},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Wichita Falls, TX"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/midwestern-state-university/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"1d82d046-ae89-4750-92ef-06f75376f8b3","content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"Mercer University","type":"College","url":"mercer-university"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.6935},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":20692},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"1100-1290"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Senior","body":"Mercer University is a great school overall. The people here made me feel so welcome, and I truly felt like part of a family during my 3 years as a student. Most of the professors are incredible people; I could tell they wanted to see me do well. Because of the small class sizes, it is really easy to build relationships with your professors and get to know other students. For me, this really helped to ensure my success in classes. In addition, there are lots of organizations and volunteer opportunities on campus to help students get involved in the community and feel at home. The campus is absolutely beautiful! However, housing isn't the greatest; some of the dorms are rather old. A few dorms are new or have been renovated recently, so those offer a better living situation. Also, there aren't many food options on campus, and I rarely visited some, as the food was inedible. The meal plans they offer are ridiculous and are not at all worth the money you are asked to spend.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2018-05-16T15:00:30.995265Z","guid":"d47ebb91-ecd3-4e3c-be64-d26c66817072","rating":4},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":3.66}],"photos":{"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-83.651042,32.829731,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-83.651042,32.829731,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.582269503546099,"count":1410},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Macon, GA"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/mercer-university/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"ee7d2698-9fcb-4645-9c99-cbc2c88cb232","content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"Creighton University","type":"College","url":"creighton-university"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.7066},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":30353},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"1050-1280"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Sophomore","body":"I do enjoy Creighton University.  After visiting Simpson, Drake, and other private Midwest four year institutions I must say that Creighton's Campus just felt like home.  The professors are all supportive and with a small student to teacher ratio, I feel like an actual person in their classes and can build a relationship with the professors.  The food is excellent, Godfather's Pizza, Chinese, Latin American, Sushi, Burgers, and buffet styled mess halls are a good indication of the different food at Creighton.  The dorms are a little on the dated side, yet they have modern amenities.  The older buildings really gives the place a theme and a warm glow.  Everything is nice and compact seeing that this campus is in the middle of Omaha and all of my classes are within 10-15 minutes of one another.  The advisors are always courteous and listen to the students needs and wants.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2018-05-31T18:36:22.198929Z","guid":"7cb7e8b5-ca43-4732-8bc5-2aa9bae9ad48","rating":4},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":3.66}],"photos":{"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-95.947029,41.265325,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-95.947029,41.265325,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.591194968553459,"count":954},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Omaha, NE"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/creighton-university/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"12ccf0cb-9ce8-4e85-9f0e-d42b2acb22a6","content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"York College of Pennsylvania","type":"College","url":"york-college-of-pennsylvania"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.6102},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":22318},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"940-1140"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Senior","body":"My experience thus far has been an amazing journey from timidness to confidence, inexperienced to knowledgeable, and  unskilled to professional. York College does a great job at preparing you to be an equipped individual who is well-rounded and ready to take on any task. Also, the personal feel here, is second to none. My professors know my name and genuinely care not only about my performance in academics, but also my personal well-being. I would like to see more diversity on campus concerning race and ethnicity.
