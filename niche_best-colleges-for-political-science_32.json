Despite the not-so-great food selection, everything else is great! The moment you step on campus, everyone is super nice and welcoming. The fact that it's a small school (which means small class sizes) makes it very easy to develop a close relationship with your professors! The classes are all academically demanding, so as long as you try and do your work, you should be fine! Student life is pretty good as the RA's and CA's, as well as the clubs and organizations around school, come up with some fun events and activities that everyone can enjoy! It honestly is very easy to make friends, especially if you live in the dorms. UST offers some great academic programs and they are very generous when awarding scholarships. Overall, the University of St. Thomas is a great school. As with every school, it does have its pros and cons, but all-in-all, your time spent here is going to be well worth it.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2016-12-20T17:36:38.487154Z","guid":"e33a7126-7e25-4d5c-a9d0-37b691ca0c80","rating":5},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":3.33}],"photos":{"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-95.394178,29.738113,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-95.394178,29.738113,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.5983050847457627,"count":590},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Houston, TX"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/university-of-st-thomas---texas/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"8ae2244e-8c01-4c25-929b-0d3efb25914b","content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"Alma College","type":"College","url":"alma-college"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.6795},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":21537},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"880-1183"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Junior","body":"Alma is a great place to come to school!

My only regret will be taking it for granted in year. \nI've made lifelong friends with peers and professors. Almost all of my professors (30 out of 33) were people I could ask to be a mentor about deep issues I was dealing with.  great networking that helps to find jobs after school! Already working full-time the summer after graduation thanks to Asbury networking. I can't say enough about how great Asbury is.

It's a great campus and a supportive community, for the most part. Majority of the buildings on campus are very old, but it seems as though some of the housing buildings are the only true indication of the campus' age. Overall the campus is a safe place, but I would like to see better management of the school's more personal cases (such as Title IX cases) and how they protect the survivors after the dust settles. I would also like to suggest starting incoming freshmen out with advisors in their fields of study, if a major has been decided upon. It would make figuring out the requirements for their majors less confusing, than to be switched around so often and risking being able to graduate on time due to lack of credits required.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2018-05-31T19:15:46.749877Z","guid":"24c0b829-00b2-4318-a915-34137ffea789","rating":4},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":2}],"photos":{"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-80.020864,36.926648,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-80.020864,36.926648,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.3839285714285716,"count":336},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Ferrum, VA"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/ferrum-college/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"b61894f0-0946-4ae9-ab8a-26ed2f085f91","content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"Notre Dame College","type":"College","url":"notre-dame-college"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.9025},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":21818},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"820-995"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Freshman","body":"Coming into NDC I had heard mixed reviews.

The resources that Regis provides their students sets them up for success and ensures that their learning is a priority. The campus is very nice and even has a Dunkin'  Donuts on site.  They really care about your success, and they help you in every way they can. My experience at Regis has been amazing, and I am very thankful for the support they have provided me with.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2018-04-28T14:35:40.374614Z","guid":"13b8c48d-cd05-44c9-83c9-9f2dae9af658","rating":5},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":2.33}],"photos":{"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-71.309126,42.351105,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-71.309126,42.351105,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.287581699346405,"count":306},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Weston, MA"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/regis-college/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"2b15541d-7892-425e-8687-13ae02e2f925","content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":true,"isPremium":true,"name":"Franklin College","type":"College","url":"franklin-college"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.61},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":22031},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"940-1480"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Junior","body":"I love Franklin College because they've given me the opportunities to be successful and excel in my career field. They helped me choose that career field by offering me an internship at a hospital where I realized that I want to pursue being a physician's assistant rather than a doctor. The community of Franklin is one big family, and I've made friendships that will last a lifetime. We're also in a unique spot being in a small town but only 30 minutes from Indianapolis.
