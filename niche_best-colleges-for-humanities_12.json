While living on campus, I have never felt more safe, safety is a top priority for the school and I am proud to call myself an eagle.

My greatest disappointment with ACU lies with its recently announced policy regarding LGBT student employees as its discriminating and distasteful rhetoric doesn't reflect the actual opinion of the campus population (my engagement with professors, staff, and students and observance of the collective outrage over the policy has confirmed as much for me). As an LGBT student who had an active role in multiple campus positions, it was greatly disappointing to learn the administration's recent decision. I hope that they will revoke this discriminating change, as the community here is really accepting and loving.

While it has a very rigorous academic program, the school also provides a range of resource to choose from if a student is ever in need of help, both academically and otherwise. Despite being an open campus, as a cis-female individual I still feel reasonably safe. The campus is small and beautiful, with the state capital building just across the street. The student body shares a close-knit bond that is perhaps even more so than larger schools, due to the smaller undergrad population. Professors and staff are generally very open, accepting, and easy to approach without fear of judgement. It is a very expensive education, but the majority of students receive some sort of financial aid or scholarship.

Seton Hall athletics is one of the best parts of campus life. With 14 D1 sports teams there is always a game to watch and cheer on. The men's basketball team plays at the Prudential Center in Newark, NJ and they play in the Big East Conference.

Greek life is available on campus but will not make or break your experience.

While the Diocese of Scranton retained ownership of the University, it was administered by the Lasallian Christian Brothers from 1888 to 1942.[4] In 1942, the Society of Jesus took ownership and control of the University.[5] During the 1960s, the University became an independent institution under a lay Board of Trustees.

Taking into consideration that UCF is the second largest University in the United States of America, you could say that it is a pretty intimidating start of a new begining. Although, with my professors, student life, leadership opportunities, clubs/organizations, and the overall structure of the campus itself has made my experience thus far absolutely amazing. I could never picture myself spending these four years anywhere else!","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2018-05-25T21:29:00.356923Z","guid":"4afb08d2-dc9c-463e-94d0-1d4fd5f5bbc9","rating":5},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":3.66}],"photos":{"default":{"author":"ucfblog","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/ca592e3988773107868625cb52360dd817f49cbf.jpg","MobileHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/c9923b9bf52c08d3e5bfc321d300e65797240a59.jpg","Thumbnail":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/5e70139314570d477f12540df95a6df7f128fbdf"},"licenseName":"CC BY-SA","licenseUrl":"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/","sourceUrl":"https://www.flickr.com/photos/ucfblog/4698157590/"},"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-81.198805,28.60106,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-81.198805,28.60106,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.765588350273651,"count":20464},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Orlando, FL"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/university-of-central-florida/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"3e396f84-b98a-45bb-9bf4-845c1c49a3e0","badge":{"display":"Best Colleges in America","ordinal":341,"total":1644,"vanityURL":"best-colleges"},"content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"Nebraska Wesleyan University","type":"College","url":"nebraska-wesleyan-university"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.7438},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":23540},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"950-1230"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Sophomore","body":"Nebraska Wesleyan University has a great campus, great students, and wonderful professors.  I recommend going to Nebraska Wesleyan for the small feel university.  While attending this school you will also feel the close-knit community with a big city feel of Lincoln. There is always something to do whether on campus or in Lincoln. \n\nNebraska Wesleyan has many different organizations to join from sororities and fraternities, intramurals, to other organizations. I am in International Relations Organization, this organization you interact and have fun with foreign exchange students.  We have many exchange students.

It is not a typical college campus with brick buildings and grassy fields. It's nestled in the city of Richmond where you have a diverse and dynamic mix of students, city dwellers, artists, and everything you can imagine! I would never trade this for another \"typical\" school. In terms of academics, everything is accessible through student tutoring sessions, group review sessions (highly advisable). It's challenging (especially if you do the Honors College), but worth your while. THe study abroad programs are EXCELLENT. I did 2 of them myself, and definitely recommend it-- they find a way to finance whatever study abroad you want to do, through their scholarship office. \nI only take 1 star away because I was a commuter and did not enjoy VCU as much as the residential students. However, the commute is also highly doable and there is a lot of parking available to students. Honestly, VCU is the way to go.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2018-05-01T08:37:43.300365Z","guid":"f71873d8-b412-454c-be0c-5f8da8fc5baa","rating":4},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":3.33}],"photos":{"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-77.453597,37.547631,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-77.453597,37.547631,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.6626812515899263,"count":3931},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Richmond, VA"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/virginia-commonwealth-university/#scatterplot"}}]}
