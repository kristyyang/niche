Academically, if you take the time to study and communicate with your instructors then it's not too difficult. There are also a lot of academic resources (for free) that NAU provides for their students to succeed in their classes. Overall, NAU is a solid university to attend and I'm glad that I picked it.

The professors are knowledgable and with a smaller campus and small class sizes, you can really get the attention and help you need from your professors. However, Cal Poly struggles with diversity. There are some programs directed to making prospective students of color feel more welcome (such as Poly Cultural Weekend) but overall, people of color make up less than half of the student body. There is even less people of color apart of Cal Poly's faculty. The lack of diversity is also apparent in the town, not just on campus.  If you are coming from a big city to San Luis Obispo, Cal Poly will be a big change. Since it is such a smaller, quieter area, there is not much to do here, especially if you're under 21. That being said, there are a lot of places to hike and hammock if you're a nature lover! The Farmers Market on Thursdays are a popular spot and attract many residents. The beaches are beautiful.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2018-03-17T01:44:31.222074Z","guid":"9ff1f622-a6e1-446a-a07d-cb47c5a415e5","rating":4},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":4}],"photos":{"default":{"crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/d616af4cad52b01bbd8dd743a1d9e0ce6ae6f812.jpg","MobileHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/aca929811f06f81522da2dd062f12da6e2a1c0c7.jpg","Thumbnail":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/1f9a259894aa3b00a7947ed85418992f32b03688"},"licenseName":"UNLICENSED"},"mapbox_header":{"crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-120.65856,35.29889,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-120.65856,35.29889,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"UNLICENSED"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.6969783352337515,"count":3508},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"San Luis Obispo, CA"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/california-polytechnic-state-university---san-luis-obispo/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"b81bcc1a-38e4-469e-aee1-2084c9d7f43d","content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"University of Connecticut","type":"College","url":"university-of-connecticut"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.488},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":19064},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"1120-1340"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Junior","body":"I like UConn because it really gives ample opportunities for anyone to pursue their interests and diverge further in that field. It is very diverse with people from all around the world. The professors are very helpful and there is a common theme of \"the mission to education\" where every person is working with another to improve the educational experience for everyone. \nAlthough having large classes might be an advantage for some people, it minimizes the interaction between the students, which could be improved. Students don't interact very well in classes and rely on extracurricular activities or living on campus to get to know more people. Additionally, another area where the university can improve is the campus food! The dining halls don't present a variety of options, which makes it hard for some people to find what is right for them.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2018-02-13T23:38:36.65625Z","guid":"3eae44c9-11d7-4bd7-b6bb-a66916179cb7","rating":4},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":3.66}],"photos":{"default":{"author":"c-chen","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/1ffc5e24c53bf90b27f3233f41b9d3f8022122a6.jpg","MobileHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/1b1628fbaa3b25606429ec6955db55878bb4808e.jpg","Thumbnail":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/9c7e717a597fd715d684dca9de7a19daa3341afa"},"licenseName":"CC BY-SA","licenseUrl":"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/","sourceUrl":"https://www.flickr.com/photos/c-chen/6266767392/"},"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-72.249519,41.808205,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-72.249519,41.808205,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.5493150684931507,"count":2920},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Storrs, CT"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/university-of-connecticut/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"e2c23d77-a108-41a1-b566-05fcb2e742c6","content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"Oklahoma State University","type":"College","url":"oklahoma-state-university"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.7452},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":13951},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"970-1200"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Sophomore","body":"All of my first year professors were very kind and knowledgeable about the subjects they taught.

Despite all of its flaws and imperfections, it is a safe space where I can explore and learn. The campus itself is a small city with features that make it feel more cozy than full-out sophisticated. From our beautiful Cathedral of Learning (we lovingly call her Cathy) to the spacious Schenley Park, there are tons of secret nooks that are perfect for studying. The professors, while teaching multiple classes, still make themselves available for questions outside the classroom. They are never too busy to stop and chat if you see them around campus; they really care about your education and that you have a passion for what you are studying. Overall, Pitt is an amazing college to attend. The community surrounding the campus challenge you and support you all at once.

The teachers you meet show that they actually put genuine thought and belief into the subject that they teach, unlike most Highschools you recently get out of.

The buildings look great and the mostly glass designs give off an open, chic vibe. Webb University Center, or the Webb as we call it, has 5+ eateries, a video game lobby, pool tables, and it is home to many student activities. Unlike other schools, Old Dominion allows their freshman to enjoy their college experience. We have only 1-2 visitation rules, residents don't have a curfew, and dorms are co-ed. With all this freedom, the university still makes sure our work gets done. We are given free tutoring, study rooms on every floor of every dorm, and many educational centers. To relax from the stress of school, you could party near or on campus! Safe Ride (ODU's free transportation.) will take you anywhere that isn't beyond 38th street, which most parties aren't.

Food\nFood in Cornell is very delicious. It is just like a buffet! Compared to all other school cafeterias I have visited, I think Cornell has one of the best campus foods in the United States.\n3. Friends / Networks\nOf course friends and networks are the most important above all. Because it is a private Ivy-league school, all smart and mostly above middle class students gather around school networks, which I assume will be very powerful for future career.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2017-09-25T13:31:40.244087Z","guid":"d77c63b8-18a4-4b94-905a-7557fc69066f","rating":4},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":4.33}],"photos":{"default":{"author":"upsand","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/19cbfe96549e0a2f72fb73b95192401c29c53f9a.jpg","MobileHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/8ba1cace2e9f604d188811f48e30cd9d23c07e63.jpg","Thumbnail":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/d520c50b02dbd15e4aec7320c47ac53384314ba5"},"licenseName":"CC BY ","licenseUrl":"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/2.0/","sourceUrl":"https://www.flickr.com/photos/upsand/438380547/"},"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-76.48269,42.445291,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-76.48269,42.445291,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.6823793490460157,"count":1782},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Ithaca, NY"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/cornell-university/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"3c1bba7d-a36d-493c-b74f-20b18c3c23df","content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"Baylor University","type":"College","url":"baylor-university"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.3972},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":36294},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"1120-1310"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Niche User","body":"I have visited Baylor University twice now, and each time I surprise myself by discovering new things to be fascinated by! There is an abundance of student activities on campus; you can even watch as people prance across Fountain Mall playing a game of Quidditch. Day in and day out, there are a multitude of franchises to dine in or out at. In the \"Grease Pit\", on the opposite side of the high way lining campus, there are more fast-food restaurants than you could even count on all your fingers and toes. In addition to the campus life and eateries, Baylor is the only university also certified as a zoo. With the two live bears, Joy and Lady, the campus is lit up by their presence as true mascots. Overall, Baylor is a University that provides all who visit with an experience they can never forget.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2017-09-20T23:56:26.479527Z","guid":"d5d0fd60-eeed-4c65-946f-12b1204c8a4f","rating":5},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":4}],"photos":{"default":{"author":"idibri","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/2ffbeb044fb4d9170a13937957cb326174d59aa8.jpg","MobileHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/e93d522be30ba75eb00cbbde64288df09d2f9421.jpg","Thumbnail":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/65c27d7c0a6c701dc4d1560bd180cfb49d250372"},"licenseName":"CC BY ","licenseUrl":"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/2.0/","sourceUrl":"https://www.flickr.com/photos/idibri/15272187099/"},"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-97.119359,31.545956,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-97.119359,31.545956,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.702513604560767,"count":3859},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Waco, TX"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/baylor-university/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"3a9f619c-c041-4aba-a4c6-f789b057ee3f","content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"University of Akron","type":"College","url":"university-of-akron"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.9592},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":16568},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"910-1180"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Niche User","body":"I had great experiences at the University of Akron!  All of the professors, other staff and students were so kind and helpful during my visits.  It is mostly because of them that I have decided to go to college there this year.  Along with the great rated academic programs, The University of Akron is going to be a great fit for me.  I would tell others that they may have to get used to being in a large city.  I am personally from a very small town so this is one challenge I will definitely have to try and adjust to.  The University is also a large school, but once your on the campus, it feels like a very small knit community.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2018-01-24T03:31:07.27796Z","guid":"a27c7769-9aad-41db-90d3-8a97d53c8867","rating":5},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":2.66}],"photos":{"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-81.510328,41.077768,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-81.510328,41.077768,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.514040561622465,"count":2564},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Akron, OH"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/university-of-akron/#scatterplot"}}]}
