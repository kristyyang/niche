I feel excited to come to school and learn now, after feeling burnt out after my first two years. Additionally, there are so many helpful resources to help better your education including an enormous library and success coaches! My success coach has helped me overcome my fear, nervousness, and pushed me to be a better student.

Brockport has become one of the best and hardest academic SUNY schools to get into in NY, recently. Many ratings have Brockport as a top 20 or even top 10 SUNY school in NY and their academic standards have passed every other school in the SUNY system besides Geneseo.

The professors are more than willing to sit down with you and break it down, piece by piece. You are not just another nameless face, you are you.

Through these classes, you are able to educate your self of the other perceptions, cultures, and ideas along with the synthesis of your own.

During my 4 years at Defiance College I have completed internships in my field of study to give me a better understanding for what comes next. I have also been a member of the Defiance College Softball team the last 4 years in which has taught me time management and has enhanced my leadership skills tremendously. There is nothing I would have changed throughout my time at Defiance College, it has prepared me for my future and brought me life long friendships.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2018-03-20T17:44:31.802206Z","guid":"6c15a669-7ea9-4f5b-8aef-1ea47954bda1","rating":5},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":2.33}],"photos":{"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-84.356596,41.300336,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-84.356596,41.300336,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.374269005847953,"count":171},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Defiance, OH"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/defiance-college/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"d79e3d5f-2e5b-4033-aee3-6018e5ecb90d","content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"Neumann University","type":"College","url":"neumann-university"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.9374},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":22621},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"800-980"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Senior","body":"My experience with Neumann University has been nothing but wonderful.

There are so many opportunities for students to learn and make friends. In my first week as a freshman, we had an orientation week and the staff and students were just incredible. The orientation leaders loved helping and making connections with the new students that they keep all throughout college. They did many activities like color wars and taking us to Busch Gardens. Saint Leo also is very good with keeping up with students throughout the year and making sure they stay on track. The staff is always very helpful and kind. If I could change anything it would be that the school would have a football team. I miss the Friday Night Lights every week.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2017-10-28T22:47:44.815186Z","guid":"60c2d4c6-ec2d-46e7-99de-6365ca43f072","rating":5},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":3}],"photos":{"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-82.257287,28.336776,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-82.257287,28.336776,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.6538233550681682,"count":1687},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Saint Leo, FL"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/saint-leo-university/#scatterplot"}}]}
