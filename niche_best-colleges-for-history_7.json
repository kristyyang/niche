The school is small enough that professors take interest in your activities and truly care about your success, but large enough to blend into the school if that is what you want. There are always events going on that are generally open to the students and the food at the Shoebox and Underground is simply fantastic.

Lastly, Purdue students can attend many sports events whether it be for the school's football team or even an intramural team game.

The professors are knowledgable and with a smaller campus and small class sizes, you can really get the attention and help you need from your professors. However, Cal Poly struggles with diversity. There are some programs directed to making prospective students of color feel more welcome (such as Poly Cultural Weekend) but overall, people of color make up less than half of the student body. There is even less people of color apart of Cal Poly's faculty. The lack of diversity is also apparent in the town, not just on campus.  If you are coming from a big city to San Luis Obispo, Cal Poly will be a big change. Since it is such a smaller, quieter area, there is not much to do here, especially if you're under 21. That being said, there are a lot of places to hike and hammock if you're a nature lover! The Farmers Market on Thursdays are a popular spot and attract many residents.

If you are bored after a long day of classes, the best thing to do is to sit on the grass and relax. Cornell College campus scene is beautiful all year round, spring, summer, fall, winter, I never get sick of it. \nThe food is diverse, much much better than it used to be around 4-5 years ago.

The student body shares a close-knit bond that is perhaps even more so than larger schools, due to the smaller undergrad population. Professors and staff are generally very open, accepting, and easy to approach without fear of judgement.

Moving 18 hours away from home was extremely nerve-racking but Alabama could not feel more like home. The amount of scholarship offered to out-of-state students is amazing and helps combat the high cost.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2018-04-10T19:02:12.236272Z","guid":"040f2331-f244-42bf-9627-e453172c9bff","rating":5},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":4}],"photos":{"default":{"crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/72d468d49a692298481d0fd444598807a8e348ce.jpg","MobileHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/e8b3f3c3a38131d336c2949319f659484199b5ba.jpg"},"licenseName":"UNLICENSED"},"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-87.545766,33.2144,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-87.545766,33.2144,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.8969047038752134,"count":4103},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Tuscaloosa, AL"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/the-university-of-alabama/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"6d81d181-4b7b-434c-bf08-669079673e7c","badge":{"display":"Best Colleges for History in America","ordinal":180,"total":640,"vanityURL":"best-colleges-for-history"},"content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"University of Colorado - Boulder","type":"College","url":"university-of-colorado---boulder"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.7662},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":22727},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"1070-1310"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Sophomore","body":"I love Boulder! Anyone and everyone is welcomed to be themselves regardless of their affiliations! The school does a fantastic job of making students proud of their school with the beautiful campus and enthusiastic culture. You find that CU alumns are all around the country, eager to return your \"Go Buffs!\" with one of their own. Your college experience is what you make of it. You are free to either party all the time, work-hard, or find a healthy medium. Boulder students know how to get involved in the outdoors so it is not difficult to find someone to bike with, hike with, or relax on lawns in the sunshine with. CU looks massive on paper, but it immediately felt like a second home.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2017-08-15T03:10:29.479301Z","guid":"aae0d57f-b36f-46ee-99b0-f065fdfb55d3","rating":5},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":4}],"photos":{"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-105.267061,40.004415,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-105.267061,40.004415,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.678503245513555,"count":2619},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Boulder, CO"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/university-of-colorado---boulder/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"2d53e1be-b22b-4b05-9762-93c08067ef1e","badge":{"display":"Best Colleges for History in America","ordinal":181,"total":640,"vanityURL":"best-colleges-for-history"},"content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":true,"isPremium":false,"name":"Westmont College","type":"College","url":"westmont-college"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.81},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":34974},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"1060-1280"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Sophomore","body":"Such an amazing school full of wonderful people!
