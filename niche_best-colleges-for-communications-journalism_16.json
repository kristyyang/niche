The professors here are okay, the reason why is they are very close-minded and authoritative. You cannot question their judgment, and they are not open to new ideas. The campus buildings and dorms are kept clean and updated - which is a huge plus to recompense their weaknesses. The student life here is dull since most people are commuters and the students only hang around with people from their high school. The food here is from good to average in some days. Finally, the academics here is excellent since it has tons of academic variations along with professors that are passionate about their specialized field.

My admissions counselor had made my visit made just for me and made sure that I got to do what I wanted to. The class I got to sit in on was eye opening because I got to see college students actually asking questions and one thing that really stood out to me was that the professor went back and went over a section of the lesson that some students were confused on. And that is what I look for in a college, how the professors interact with the students and how the students interact back.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2018-02-17T21:00:17.597927Z","guid":"f93f86e1-96da-47ff-9b48-060da7582608","rating":5},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":3}],"photos":{"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-96.360738,42.47324,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-96.360738,42.47324,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.6300448430493275,"count":446},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Sioux City, IA"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/morningside-college/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"48868e55-f098-4bb9-8b2c-77c4a39da505","content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":true,"isPremium":true,"name":"Westminster College - Pennsylvania","type":"College","url":"westminster-college---pennsylvania"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.7387},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":20869},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"940-1160"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Junior","body":"The highlight of Westminster is it's academices, it has some fantastic professors (if not too few at times) and for the most part very informational courses.

Even with the party crackdown, campus security still lacks cameras over most of campus and things regularly get stolen. Diversity pretty much only exists in that the sports tems try and recruit diverse teams. The school itself lacks diversity but not for any reason specifically.

The main academic building (O'Hare) was recently renovated (I believe the upgrades were $26 million) including state-of-the-art laboratories and classrooms. He loves the school and the key is to get involved with sports, clubs, volunteering, study groups, and social activities in the dorm. If you are looking for a large college or big time Division I sports, this is probably not your school. However,  if you are looking for a solid school that is on the smaller side with a beautiful campus located in a resort town and personalized attention from professors then you should check out Salve Regina.

This is not the best accessible campus. Also, the food leaves a lot to be desired. Everyone who lives on campus is required to be on a meal plan, and there are limited options other than a full meal plan. Overall it's overpriced for the quality.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2018-02-20T21:19:13.544228Z","guid":"d91b8584-c643-4fa9-9a8e-f06aa058afd5","rating":4},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":3}],"photos":{"default":{"crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/5990d158da0ca3992d0db02e090c3258bd0e2f70.jpg","MobileHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/f57dc0d294cb5d3e6881fac76165ed1407266e6a.jpg"},"licenseName":"UNLICENSED"},"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-86.753566,36.142115,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-86.753566,36.142115,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.8722222222222222,"count":360},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Nashville, TN"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/trevecca-nazarene-university/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"cd508b53-368f-4883-895a-c75b0aaa5fca","content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"SUNY College at Brockport","type":"College","url":"suny-college-at-brockport"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.5533},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":14267},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"920-1120"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Alum","body":"I graduated from The College at Brockport and received a degree in finance. It is absolutely amazing the construction and improvements they have made to their facilities. Over the last several years with tuitions going way up for private schools, many are opting for top notch State schools. Brockport has become one of the best and hardest academic SUNY schools to get into in NY, recently. Many ratings have Brockport as a top 20 or even top 10 SUNY school in NY and their academic standards have passed every other school in the SUNY system besides Geneseo. I have also seen rankings country wide with Brockport now being rated around the 50-75 range of best schools. Highly recommend to anyone interested in attending a SUNY school in NY!","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2017-09-27T14:11:38.127297Z","guid":"00750c89-32db-49b5-8e2f-e5567883c4ba","rating":5},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":3}],"photos":{"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-77.949824,43.209862,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-77.949824,43.209862,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.4708063021316033,"count":1079},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Brockport, NY"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/suny-college-at-brockport/#scatterplot"}}]}
