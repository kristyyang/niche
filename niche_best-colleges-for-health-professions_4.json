There are so many opportunities presented to students at USC that all should take advantage of. One of the most important things that is clearly valued here, is academics. My professors so far have been some of the most passionate people I have met. A favorite course I have taken here has been environmental ethics. I took this course as a philosophy requirement and it inspired me to change my major to environmental studies. The professor and the course material inspired me to make a decision that I will not soon regret. I am more than happy to say that I am a student at USC.

Hendrix College can be way too stressful at times, but at the end of the day, there are plenty of resources to help those in need of stress relief. The student housing for underclassmen, however, is abysmal. The dorms are not in the best shape, but there are plans to renovate in the next 5 years. The student Quad is better, yet the walls are so thin you can hear the student above you sneezing. The apartments are better, but they are sometimes a crap-shoot. Overal, the summer opportunities, Odyssey Program, academics, decent level of financial help, and extremely liberal atmosphere makes the high price tag worth it.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2018-01-19T17:48:02.861022Z","guid":"701064ed-b355-4b85-9988-1f95d0aacfcf","rating":4},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":3.33}],"photos":{"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-92.442021,35.09972,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-92.442021,35.09972,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.6958424507658645,"count":457},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Conway, AR"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/hendrix-college/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"ae22001d-88c2-46aa-8ba6-612846f01024","badge":{"display":"Best Colleges in America","ordinal":175,"total":1644,"vanityURL":"best-colleges"},"content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":true,"isPremium":false,"name":"Calvin College","type":"College","url":"calvin-college"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.7471},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":25446},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"1050-1285"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Sophomore","body":"Your Calvin experience all comes down to perspective. Great professors and challenging classes foster a pretty positive environment for learning. Interim classes may seem like a waste of time, but pick something that interests you and you'll be surprised. Don't slack, work hard, and you'll be fine. Dorm housing is nothing to complain about, being so close to academic buildings. There are solid people at Calvin, but it takes a while to figure social out. If you're not from the area, Dutch, 6\"2, or wear shorts in winter, it may be a little jarring, but there are great people out there. This is college, not high school, you don't need to impress anyone. Most kids grew up in the area all their lives and have known each other forever, so it certainly is a bubble. If you're from out of the country and are used to nightlife, it's painful to watch. Overall, Calvin's a good place that gives you space to develop as a person. Students listen and learn from each other, regardless of opinion.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2018-06-04T10:55:00.15119Z","guid":"af267447-0e53-4cfa-b9f9-113f0decde18","rating":4},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":4}],"photos":{"default":{"crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/100046d6ab5817509ba9ac3135f7d0337810d550.jpg","MobileHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/1b1dd584208ff1a34d63821ab2e269e780a5e0c4.jpg"},"licenseName":"UNLICENSED"},"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-85.587548,42.929916,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-85.587548,42.929916,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.8747044917257685,"count":846},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Grand Rapids, MI"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/calvin-college/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"266c4764-1afe-4dab-8f03-b48c7a3cfa57","badge":{"display":"Best Colleges in America","ordinal":183,"total":1644,"vanityURL":"best-colleges"},"content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"Providence College","type":"College","url":"providence-college"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.5503},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":35238},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"1030-1240"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Sophomore","body":"One thing I love about PC is the small-campus community feel while being able to see a new face every day.

Even though the food is not the best on campus, do not feel discouraged because the food off campus is always a hit! Dorms are mostly average, some are great while some of the older buildings definitely need renovation. Athletics are a big plus to this school whether you will be playing or in the audience. The school is strongly affiliated with the Catholic faith, however, all of the professors and Dominican Friars will be welcoming of all religious backgrounds. Also, PC may be lacking in diversity but I can tell they are trying to be more inclusive, especially when it comes to clubs and organizations. Overall, a great (and expensive) school.

Many of the professors here have gone above and beyond to accommodate for any questions and concerns that I may have. Going to an out-of-state school is very nerve wracking at first, but I am glad that I picked Elon. Elon has become my home away from home in more ways than one and I often find myself counting down the days till I am back on campus. Elon's curriculum can be very intense at times; however, I am getting an education based on the work that I put in. One complaint that I have about Elon is paying for laundry. The cost adds up very quickly and is often frustrating that I have to pay so that I am able to wear clean clothes to class. However, that is the only negative that I have so it doesn't outweigh all of the positive things that Elon has to offer me.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2018-04-19T13:43:25.478388Z","guid":"7f30ce7a-7427-4e25-bd99-8dd8702c2318","rating":5},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":3.66}],"photos":{"default":{"crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/9594d06e83a657e2511ddfd70641a213c2851460.jpg","MobileHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/42f3524b81e18c8a4e7a393354dccf1b6a43db44.jpg"},"licenseName":"UNLICENSED"},"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-79.505632,36.104149,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-79.505632,36.104149,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.5380818053596617,"count":1418},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Elon, NC"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/elon-university/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"e2c23d77-a108-41a1-b566-05fcb2e742c6","badge":{"display":"Best Colleges in America","ordinal":162,"total":1644,"vanityURL":"best-colleges"},"content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"Oklahoma State University","type":"College","url":"oklahoma-state-university"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.7452},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":13951},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"970-1200"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Sophomore","body":"All of my first year professors were very kind and knowledgeable about the subjects they taught.

I would recommend UNL to any prospective college student.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2018-01-11T20:43:26.480298Z","guid":"ac972c2e-9420-40e7-9ee7-f3e0a11b9263","rating":5},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":4}],"photos":{"default":{"author":"ivyfield","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/dcb2fb513e8b6d533b4a4991f0cef81323fb1bde.jpg","MobileHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/4690d091f954f63a1c9b504057710be089e888d2.jpg","Thumbnail":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/43295d3eedc379e04f35377371efecce49167e67"},"licenseName":"CC BY ","licenseUrl":"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/2.0/","sourceUrl":"https://www.flickr.com/photos/ivyfield/6986330897/in/album-72157603879379896/"},"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-96.702177,40.822272,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-96.702177,40.822272,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.674708818635607,"count":2404},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Lincoln, NE"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/university-of-nebraska---lincoln/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"a78118a3-87bb-4861-9b2e-06f244c53bbc","badge":{"display":"Best Colleges in America","ordinal":221,"total":1644,"vanityURL":"best-colleges"},"content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"Loyola University Maryland","type":"College","url":"loyola-university-maryland"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.6553},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":34152},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"1100-1267"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Freshman","body":"As an international student that had never lived in the USA before starting college, I feel as though Loyola was an excellent choice for me. Everyone (the students, the professors, the athletics coordinations/coaches) is so friendly, and due to Loyola's size, after the first few weeks of school you can't walk across campus without seeing a close friend! Despite the high acceptance rate, the academics are challenging yet interesting, and therefore worthwhile. Loyola's core curriculum, although intimidating at first, is extremely valuable in ensuring every student's education is well rounded (plus it helps to break up the classes for your major, which certainly helps me to stay focused by doing something different).

It is very diverse with people from all around the world. The professors are very helpful and there is a common theme of \"the mission to education\" where every person is working with another to improve the educational experience for everyone. \nAlthough having large classes might be an advantage for some people, it minimizes the interaction between the students, which could be improved. Students don't interact very well in classes and rely on extracurricular activities or living on campus to get to know more people. Additionally, another area where the university can improve is the campus food! The dining halls don't present a variety of options, which makes it hard for some people to find what is right for them.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2018-02-13T23:38:36.65625Z","guid":"3eae44c9-11d7-4bd7-b6bb-a66916179cb7","rating":4},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":3.66}],"photos":{"default":{"author":"c-chen","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/1ffc5e24c53bf90b27f3233f41b9d3f8022122a6.jpg","MobileHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/1b1628fbaa3b25606429ec6955db55878bb4808e.jpg","Thumbnail":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/9c7e717a597fd715d684dca9de7a19daa3341afa"},"licenseName":"CC BY-SA","licenseUrl":"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/","sourceUrl":"https://www.flickr.com/photos/c-chen/6266767392/"},"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-72.249519,41.808205,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-72.249519,41.808205,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.5493150684931507,"count":2920},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Storrs, CT"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/university-of-connecticut/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"db834c81-d7d7-47f3-9371-301211841fb4","badge":{"display":"Best Colleges in America","ordinal":317,"total":1644,"vanityURL":"best-colleges"},"content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"Saint Joseph's University","type":"College","url":"saint-josephs-university"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.7793},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":36058},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"1050-1230"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Junior","body":"Saint Joseph's University is a well balanced 4-year university.

You truly get a liberal arts experience, taking courses in all different areas of studies. The business school is career driven which is a huge positive, having a focus on getting a job in the future. SJU is a perfect size to make you feel welcome and help you step out of your comfort zone. It has about 5,000 undergraduate students allowing it to feel big and small all at the same time.

It is a gorgeous campus. It also has an amazing staff who take the time to know you well. It is a Southern Baptist school, so most of the students have more conservative values although they are not insanely conservative and are very open minded to the ideas of other individuals. Samford is also located in a nice area of Birmingham, AL that offers enough fun to try something new every weekend. The area also contains many healthy churches that can enrich your college experience ten-fold.\nThere are some pitfalls. The diversity here is a bit pitiful and the conservative atmosphere of the school may also be suffocating to certain individuals. Parties are fairly few and far between. However, it is easy to find other places in Birmingham to party or dance if you are looking for that sort of scene.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2018-01-19T18:22:13.325725Z","guid":"b798cac4-162b-4396-9ee9-bb303e73ad0f","rating":5},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":3.66}],"photos":{"default":{"crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/15fccd3ac6b7a2c2969729c22316a789adc3748f.jpg","MobileHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/8ad7f28e75dee67d79ce128d598ad4705f4728f3.jpg"},"licenseName":"UNLICENSED"},"mapbox_header":{"crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-86.790932,33.464578,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-86.790932,33.464578,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"UNLICENSED"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.7466666666666666,"count":675},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Birmingham, AL"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/samford-university/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"1cdf907c-1b8c-4174-9277-c67d6a59d677","badge":{"display":"Best Colleges in America","ordinal":138,"total":1644,"vanityURL":"best-colleges"},"content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":true,"isPremium":false,"name":"Syracuse University","type":"College","url":"syracuse-university"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.5232},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":31823},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"1090-1290"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Graduate Student","body":"It is such an amazing university.

All and all, its impossible to stress how at home I feel here and anyone who steps foot on the campus and talks to someone who works or attended this school would know why.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2018-01-19T20:55:56.465563Z","guid":"478010fe-1382-4c27-9ee6-648e3046124f","rating":5},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":4}],"photos":{"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-93.189422,44.941662,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-93.189422,44.941662,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.765740740740741,"count":1080},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Saint Paul, MN"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/university-of-st-thomas---minnesota/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"366832a5-05dd-47e7-9434-91ad1d86f859","badge":{"display":"Best Colleges in America","ordinal":257,"total":1644,"vanityURL":"best-colleges"},"content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"University of Kentucky","type":"College","url":"university-of-kentucky"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.9079},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":17850},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"1000-1250"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Sophomore","body":"The University of Kentucky is one of the best universities I've ever been to!  The campus is beautiful and everyone is so welcoming.  I felt at home the first time I visited and automatically I knew UK was the school I wanted to attend.  There's a whole week of activities in August before classes start specifically for incoming freshman to get them acclimated to the university and show them everything UK has to offer.  There are numerous tutoring services and most professors are flexible with their office hours to find a time that works for the student.  Almost everyday there's a different activity happening on campus, from goat yoga and Pinterest parties for stress relief, to live music and food to spend time with friends, to tailgates before sports games to support our Wildcats with the most spirit.  It's clear that the university strives to create the best environment for students' success and well-being.  I'm so glad I picked the University of Kentucky!","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2018-05-14T15:04:16.447793Z","guid":"a3f7d5a6-28dc-47e6-99cb-be3142f79a96","rating":5},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":3.66}],"photos":{"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-84.509177,38.032393,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-84.509177,38.032393,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.6611256926217557,"count":3429},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Lexington, KY"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/university-of-kentucky/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"95009e06-caa3-4ad2-801a-a1251d4ff41a","badge":{"display":"Best Colleges in America","ordinal":247,"total":1644,"vanityURL":"best-colleges"},"content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"University of the Pacific","type":"College","url":"university-of-the-pacific"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.6599},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":33794},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"1030-1300"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Sophomore","body":"I like that the classes are generally small, even for freshmen GE classes. All of the professors I've had so far except one, are very helpful, and you are able to establish a more personal relationship with your professors due to the small class sizes. All of your professors will know your name, and they really care about helping you individually, how you are doing, and care about making sure you succeed, especially in SIS (department of International Studies). Another pro is that since its a small school, everybody knows everybody for the most part, and everybody is very friendly. For this reason, its also easy to make and find friends, and you'll see the usual students you see around the usual times you see them when you go to the cafeteria, the lair, the gym, or the library.\nThe Freshmen dorms, the walls are VERY thin, you literally could hear everything so it could get annoying if your floor or neighbors are loud and you want to sleep, study, or just want some peace and quiet.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2018-06-02T18:05:05.687909Z","guid":"2b702cec-ed70-418f-b294-d8d325c942f7","rating":4},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":3.66}],"photos":{"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-121.307296,37.980624,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-121.307296,37.980624,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.5813544415127527,"count":1137},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Stockton, CA"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/university-of-the-pacific/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"d5a8a9d2-33cc-48bb-9c90-4647317d5075","badge":{"display":"Best Colleges in America","ordinal":167,"total":1644,"vanityURL":"best-colleges"},"content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":true,"isPremium":true,"name":"Colorado State University","type":"College","url":"colorado-state-university"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.7796},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":16232},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"1020-1250"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Alum","body":"Colorado State University met all my expectations for the college I had always imagined going to for my bachelors degree. Unfortunately for me, at the time I had no clue what I wanted out of life and very little passion for the degree I had chosen to study there which was Journalism. I had no direction, no motivation, and no confidence which quickly led to my demise. Finally, over three years later, I now have realized my path and it has absolutely nothing to do with CSU or politics. I am sure it's a great school with tons to offer if you apply yourself, but to be honest I got very little out of my education there and feel like I may have waisted a lot of time and money during my 7 year stint at Colorado State University.

It's a small campus which makes getting around to classes super easy. It also means that everyone knows everyone else, and everyone on campus, staff, faculty, and students are friendly! The buildings are nice and classrooms are comfortable. Fontbonne recently added a new parking lot which helped a lot. Fontbonne also offers a lot of activities and fun events. The only thing I would change is the cost of parking passes. FBU is a private University so tuition is crazy expensive and so are parking passes. I feel like since we already pay a ton in tuition, parking passes should be cheaper, if not free!
