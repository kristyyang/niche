It is completely possible to challenge yourself academically here. In the science department, the professors are very highly qualified and teach the material very well. The staff here are all incredibly helpful and approachable. Rosemont is a small community where people all around campus know each other. People here genuinely want you to succeed. For undergraduate science students, research opportunities are incredibly accessible which is not common at large universities. I am only a freshman and already know the chair of my department well and plan to join her research team sophomore year. There are also many hospitals and medical facilities in the area where students can get volunteer hours. One thing about this school that is a positive aspect for me, but not everyone, is the lack of a large party scene.

Regardless, most of the professors do care about you as long as you're willing to level with them. You will have at least one whose class you hate, and at least 1-3 that you will absolutely love. If you are an illustration or fashion major, I would highly recommend this school. Otherwise, this school still has a great location, great connections, and great facilities. No matter what, you will feel salty leaving this school with a huge debt to pay off, but if you put it in the work you'll be able to learn a lot from the experience.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2018-03-13T21:18:42.969853Z","guid":"2d05df6e-f09b-44c5-8f56-b5c9741a9918","rating":4},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":2.66}],"photos":{"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-75.1738,39.9573,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-75.1738,39.9573,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.696629213483146,"count":178},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Philadelphia, PA"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/moore-college-of-art--and--design/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"12494d4c-19f8-49ef-b1d6-f28067c92e53","content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":true,"isPremium":false,"name":"Principia College","type":"College","url":"principia-college"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.9091},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":14499},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"970-1240"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Sophomore","body":"I grew up attending public schools and knew I wanted to attend a small liberal arts college.

The school has purchased all parking anywhere near the school and parking permits are needed everywhere. I tried to buy a parking permit but there were no more available. So I was forced to walk a mile to classes, and even still had to pay at parking meters. I didn't mind the walk, but sometimes could not find parking. Another thing I didn't appreciate is that there are no places where I could pump my breast milk, since I am a breastfeeding momma.

The campus offers a calm and friendly scene while promoting cultural and international affairs.  The current economic crisis has impacted the students, making them more knowledgeable in politics and economics, while raising new activists who speak up for those who do not have the needed courage.   The curriculums are exquisite for those who want to learn more about social studies and humanities while majoring in medicine, communications, entrepreneurship, and others.  I highly recommend the public University for those who want to learn about Caribbean studies, natural sciences, and linguistics.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2018-05-14T18:16:14.612966Z","guid":"1088835f-b98c-484e-97c2-8e0f61d0a4c0","rating":4},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade"}],"photos":{"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-66.045875,18.403027,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-66.045875,18.403027,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.5181159420289854,"count":552},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1"},{"label":"TaglineFact2"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/university-of-puerto-rico---rio-piedras/#scatterplot"}}]}
