The administration has been intact for some 40 years, therefore it is very difficult to get things such as food quality, dorm maintenance, and events to change for the better. Although this year was a very academically rigorous year, it did lack in other areas. In the aforementioned areas, students had to organize a sit in protest in order to have our voices and concerns addressed. Academically speaking, Hampton University is not lacking at all, well, at least in my experience.

Other than being an HBCU my experience at Bethune Cookman University was personal knowing my dad attended the university. The greatest asset BCU provides is the connection between everyone. We are definitely a family! From our café having an expanded menu, our love for musicality, school spirit, great hospitality from our RA’s, exceptional professors, accessible clubs and organizations, and the importance of serving others has not only made my experience remarkable but confirmed my decision on being a part of wildcat nation.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2018-04-02T20:11:03.204287Z","guid":"2266bbe2-a1bd-47f2-b7b2-8045d55b1c4a","rating":5},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":2.33}],"photos":{"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-81.031429,29.210193,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-81.031429,29.210193,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.450179211469534,"count":1395},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Daytona Beach, FL"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/bethune-cookman-university/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"4fa61b7f-bd1a-40eb-9843-098177afbda2","badge":{"display":"Best Colleges in America","ordinal":91,"total":1644,"vanityURL":"best-colleges"},"content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"University of Tulsa","type":"College","url":"university-of-tulsa"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.4},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":27264},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"1100-1390"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Graduate Student","body":"TU's college of law is fully geared toward the students success.

I love a good amount of the professors. They love what they are doing. There is not very much to do in Fairbanks. Having a car is vital if you want to get around. The buses will work in a pinch but they can be unreliable. If you want to have fun while you are here, get into winter sports.

There are lots of opportunities to get involved on campus outside of class. Intramurals happen year-round and are competitive and fun. Olivet puts on all-school parties/events during syllabus week and around holidays with free food and games. Olivet really caters to freshmen to make sure they have a great experience and feel like they belong. There are always plenty of jobs on and off campus as there is a pretty large community around campus. Every room comes with a Tempur-Pedic bed, making it impossible to get out of bed in the morning. High ceilings for bunking beds to create more room. After freshman year, you have an option to live off-campus in an apartment.  All rent is included in the room and board fees. All laundry is free on and off campus.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2018-05-17T15:27:58.911548Z","guid":"86e16a4d-1045-4c28-ac50-c3abc4ebc221","rating":5},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":3}],"photos":{"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-87.873654,41.155489,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-87.873654,41.155489,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.691693290734824,"count":1252},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Bourbonnais, IL"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/olivet-nazarene-university/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"115796b4-a9ea-457d-8f42-15755f0b306f","badge":{"display":"Best Colleges in America","ordinal":297,"total":1644,"vanityURL":"best-colleges"},"content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"Seattle Pacific University","type":"College","url":"seattle-pacific-university"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.8728},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":29174},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"990-1230"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Junior","body":"I really like the small school atmosphere of the place.

Although it is a commuter college, there are many ways to get involved in the school such as sports, clubs, and work! Indiana University Northwest is committed to its students and faculty. Students have many opportunities to work with professors and coordinators on large projects that teaches students how to think critically.
