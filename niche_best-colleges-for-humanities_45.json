Its a close knit school and very friendly csmpus. Academics are very good with small class sizes.  My daughter, who is African American, has made friends of all sorts and is involved in a lot. Sure, it does not have the big school sports scene but the college was top ranked in division two in severals sports. Security seems tight so far and there's a real emphasis on community service. If you want a school where the student will not get lost in a crowd and will get a very good foundation, Rockhurst is an under the radar gem with well respected academics as with most Jesuit colleges. Its not a commuter school even though its in an urban area.

I injured my knee and my coach and trainers have been so supportive. I will be back on the field next year! There isn’t a contained campus but I was able to live in the dorms a block away from the academic building which was nice. Next year I will have to live further away which isn’t as convenient. I would recommend everyone have a car. Grocery shopping isn’t within walking distance and neither is the fields for sports. There is a Starbucks in the bookstore! It would be nice if the cafeteria was open more hours for athletes schedules. I can walk to a church I like on Sundays. I would recommend Point University! Soon more buildings will be up as they have proposed, that will be nice.

While on campus, many of the staff members will get to know you by name, not as a number. To me, it is really important to recognize students and call them by name, as it makes you feel important.

The environment is quiet,friendly and secure but there is not a lot to do around campus.If you're someone who's used to partying a lot and hoping to enjoy college life as they show in the movies, then you might wanna consider other options.

It's a great campus and a supportive community, for the most part. Majority of the buildings on campus are very old, but it seems as though some of the housing buildings are the only true indication of the campus' age. Overall the campus is a safe place, but I would like to see better management of the school's more personal cases (such as Title IX cases) and how they protect the survivors after the dust settles. I would also like to suggest starting incoming freshmen out with advisors in their fields of study, if a major has been decided upon. It would make figuring out the requirements for their majors less confusing, than to be switched around so often and risking being able to graduate on time due to lack of credits required.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2018-05-31T19:15:46.749877Z","guid":"24c0b829-00b2-4318-a915-34137ffea789","rating":4},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":2}],"photos":{"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-80.020864,36.926648,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-80.020864,36.926648,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.3839285714285716,"count":336},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Ferrum, VA"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/ferrum-college/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"271075b3-07a0-450b-b4f3-78eb1fc7c03a","badge":{"display":"Best Colleges in America","ordinal":38,"total":1644,"vanityURL":"best-colleges"},"content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":true,"isPremium":false,"name":"Haverford College","type":"College","url":"haverford-college"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.214},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":21144},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"1320-1520"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Sophomore","body":"Haverford is an top-notch school academically with a very welcoming social environment for the most part.

You are expected to be involved to go above and beyond what you thought you were capable and are demanded more of.
