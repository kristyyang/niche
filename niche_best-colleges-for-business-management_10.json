SHU has representation from every state in the US and 70 countries. While based in Catholicism, SHU has almost a 50% diversity rate and welcomes people of any faith or belief system. Seton Hall athletics is one of the best parts of campus life. With 14 D1 sports teams there is always a game to watch and cheer on. The men's basketball team plays at the Prudential Center in Newark, NJ and they play in the Big East Conference. Going to basketball games is a highlight of the school year!\nOverall, social life on campus is awesome. There is always stuff to do on campus during the week and the weekends. Greek life is available on campus but will not make or break your experience. Like any school, it all depends on your willingness to put yourself out there - and SHU provides more than enough opportunities to do so. \nAlso, the FOOD is good! There are so many options and they change everyday.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2018-06-04T15:47:01.313883Z","guid":"67c0457c-4298-460b-8f22-c636e1cfaae0","rating":5},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":3.33}],"photos":{"default":{"crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/10c17ac338d092c6f9efeb8f4647806e6133a5e2.jpg","MobileHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/724f3858e89a297148ff496d8377ac95ea1db212.jpg"},"licenseName":"UNLICENSED"},"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-74.248753,40.742859,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-74.248753,40.742859,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.6006984866123397,"count":1718},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"South Orange, NJ"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/seton-hall-university/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"bdac122e-a35a-4b98-81df-b60b0070f01d","badge":{"display":"Best Colleges for Business in America","ordinal":242,"total":1020,"vanityURL":"best-colleges-for-business"},"content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"University of Scranton","type":"College","url":"university-of-scranton"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.7455},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":33701},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"1030-1220"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Niche User","body":"The University of Scranton is a private, non-profit, co-educational, Catholic and Jesuit research university, located in the historic Hill Section of Scranton, Pennsylvania, United States. It was founded in 1888 by William O'Hara, the first Bishop of Scranton, as St. Thomas College.[2] In 1938, the College was elevated to university status and took the name The University of Scranton.[3] The institution was operated by the Diocese of Scranton from its founding until 1897. While the Diocese of Scranton retained ownership of the University, it was administered by the Lasallian Christian Brothers from 1888 to 1942.[4] In 1942, the Society of Jesus took ownership and control of the University.[5] During the 1960s, the University became an independent institution under a lay Board of Trustees. The University of Scranton is one of 28 member institutions of the Association of Jesuit Colleges and Universities and is served by the Scranton Jesuit Community.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2018-05-30T14:39:25.448236Z","guid":"4c470faf-319f-45ef-827a-dd7c99a08494","rating":5},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":3.66}],"photos":{"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-75.658031,41.40715,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-75.658031,41.40715,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.614991482112436,"count":587},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Scranton, PA"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/university-of-scranton/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"4419c2e8-24f5-43f2-aff5-fa70b1063be4","badge":{"display":"Best Colleges for Business in America","ordinal":243,"total":1020,"vanityURL":"best-colleges-for-business"},"content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"Saint Mary's College - Indiana","type":"College","url":"saint-marys-college---indiana"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.8165},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":25991},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"980-1160"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Sophomore","body":"I recently just transferred here, and so far its been great!

In my opinion, Winthrop is a smaller Clemson. Furthermore, the student ratio is 15:1. Another reason is the convivial atmosphere. Winthrop's faculties are organized, easy to find, and productive. For example, the student center has over four different restaurants and the workers are nice. The staff occupying these places such as the recreation center, bookstore, and admissions office are welcoming, helpful, and friendly.

It's a small campus which makes getting around to classes super easy. It also means that everyone knows everyone else, and everyone on campus, staff, faculty, and students are friendly! The buildings are nice and classrooms are comfortable. Fontbonne recently added a new parking lot which helped a lot. Fontbonne also offers a lot of activities and fun events.

NNU also puts on weekly, fun and exciting events for students to connect deeper with one another. \n\nI would highly recommend NNU to anyone!","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2017-05-07T21:52:33.442459Z","guid":"36e51e85-f831-4576-ba70-a2a902dd9b40","rating":5},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":3.33}],"photos":{"default":{"crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/c2b5c84fc1b186143eec1e4182d5b6c29c42e2a1.jpg","MobileHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/cc8f89e695b62d60a203c95abd6e047b3d38eaaa.jpg"},"licenseName":"UNLICENSED"},"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-116.564792,43.563181,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-116.564792,43.563181,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.960294117647059,"count":680},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Nampa, ID"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/northwest-nazarene-university/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"f1beaf3e-6d1e-4f1c-9095-edc88fcee003","badge":{"display":"Best Colleges for Business in America","ordinal":256,"total":1020,"vanityURL":"best-colleges-for-business"},"content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"Pace University","type":"College","url":"pace-university"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.8368},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":31040},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"940-1160"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Freshman","body":"I really like it here at Pace University, there are so many opportunities available to students. The location is a definite plus, as most New York attractions are just a short walk or subway ride away. The academics are exceptional and it is especially advantageous for Business majors to be located in the heart of Wall Street. Aside from that, there are many campus activities and clubs for students to join, and there is always free food available at one event or the other! The faculty are very helpful and they are invested in seeing students succeed, which can really help boost student morale. In addition to this, the university really pushes for real world experience, like internships, and the career services department is a great resource for students to utilize in their search for such experiences.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2018-04-19T04:46:05.82642Z","guid":"93484419-e007-4bae-9406-73c69997f6ac","rating":5},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":3}],"photos":{"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-74.004719,40.711014,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-74.004719,40.711014,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.5303896103896104,"count":1925},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"New York, NY"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/pace-university/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"533f2386-5857-40b0-89d4-1c7dab149e94","badge":{"display":"Best Colleges for Business in America","ordinal":257,"total":1020,"vanityURL":"best-colleges-for-business"},"content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"California Baptist University","type":"College","url":"california-baptist-university"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.6399},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":25875},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"850-1100"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Junior","body":"California Baptist University has provided me and most other people I know a space for spiritual growth and a natural urge for academic curiosity.

It is a conservative campus and I am a conservative and I am a political science major looking for a challenge. Although professors are usually Christian and conservative,  they put on their Marxist and liberal thinking caps and made their students think about our own views; it was a challenge after all!

Overall, the University provides an ideal situation for those who are not aiming for a large campus or large school. Buildings are no more than 10 minutes away from one another and the chances of bumping into someone you know is very high. Students tend to be interactive when walking to classes and it is just a healthy environment for students who are wanting to get to know others in their major and in the dorms and all over campus.

It’s definitely a you-get-what-you-put-into-it. You will encounter caring and passionate professors and a community. Every time  I visit the campus, it seems more diverse and of course, that’s inspiring. I was a business major but the liberal arts aspects - learning to think deeply and to constantly question the answer with a critical view - is what this school is about. This school opens you up to making connections in material and in the real world. I went straight to NYC for a decade, two weeks after graduating from SMC. I will say that St Mary’s is a bubble; the school isn’t so much about teaching street smarts, but you can easily learn all things academic here, if you choose. Getting involved is key, too. And the alum connections are fantastic.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2018-01-31T03:03:06.941108Z","guid":"5686601b-d54d-469e-9454-6c70f11964ef","rating":5},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":3}],"photos":{"default":{"crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/68230b16c524283b20c97f5553a65f9f64cebca3.jpg","MobileHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/ee1db27e1d81d98d86958480706360176cc0b1f0.jpg"},"licenseName":"UNLICENSED"},"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-122.106795,37.83997,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-122.106795,37.83997,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.528263103802672,"count":973},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Moraga, CA"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/saint-marys-college-of-california/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"c22feca2-515f-4ae6-84a0-fe2af91f6c4b","badge":{"display":"Best Colleges for Business in America","ordinal":266,"total":1020,"vanityURL":"best-colleges-for-business"},"content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":true,"isPremium":true,"name":"Quinnipiac University","type":"College","url":"quinnipiac-university"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.69},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":37439},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"980-1190"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Sophomore","body":"One thing I always loved about Quinnipiac University is the beauty of its campus! It is such a relaxing environment and you never get bored of looking at that view. Quinnipiac was a very convenient choice for me because I was planning on being a commuter and the campus is close to home. In my second year here, I can say with certainty that everyone here is so friendly and always willing to help you. The professors are amazing and they will do everything they can to make sure you are understanding the concepts and succeeding academically. Another interesting thing about Quinnipiac is that it has many clubs and organizations available. In this way, each student can definitely find something that matches their hobbies and interests. And lastly, I am glad I chose Quinnipiac because it offers such an interesting major, which is Behavioral Neuroscience. I recently declared it and I can't wait to explore it further more in the months to come!","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2017-10-02T17:40:43.034339Z","guid":"3bd64d3d-094c-49df-942d-ca0a22242104","rating":5},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":3.33}],"photos":{"default":{"crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/c961c711b4b64bfd61847d72217c707792e082b6.jpg","MobileHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/0aeb2577dea0abc6367c8101d8e600c38c3a97f5.jpg"},"licenseName":"UNLICENSED"},"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-72.895542,41.419527,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-72.895542,41.419527,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.507514450867052,"count":1730},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Hamden, CT"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/quinnipiac-university/#scatterplot"}}]}
