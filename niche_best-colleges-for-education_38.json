The academics are optimal and require professionalism and the programs expect high quality, to their best effort out of the students. The community is very open and willing to help anybody. Lyndon gives the opportunity for students to be an athlete while having their main focus on school then sports after. There is many activities to do on campus from student life scheduling opportunities.

I will be a junior Fall 2018. It is the most diverse campus I've stepped foot on. All of my professors are great and actually cares about each individual student. The falculty is wonderful. There are so many opportunities that Huston-Tillotson University offers their students. If I could change anything, it would probably be the size of the dorms. They're very small rooms shared by 2 people. The temperature is almost never right, either too hot or too cold. But other than that, I believe there is nothing else I would change about my HBCU. I love it here and can't wait to give back.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2018-05-29T17:39:46.534573Z","guid":"4c85e3b6-282f-4118-8a85-08c4742aeaf0","rating":4},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":2}],"photos":{"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-97.721698,30.264672,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-97.721698,30.264672,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.4952380952380953,"count":420},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Austin, TX"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/huston-tillotson-university/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"2f4db4c0-cf93-49af-b39b-084316855e0e","content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"Dickinson State University","type":"College","url":"dickinson-state-university"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.9171},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":11286},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"850-1200"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Freshman","body":"This is actually a very small university with about 4000 students including online. The people you meet and the faculty are what makes this school achieve any greatness. They have awesome programs that help the poor and disabled students. If you can get into the Theodore Roosevelt Honors Leadership Program -DO IT! They will give you 3000 a year for four years! The school is realitively affordable, and works tirelessly to provide a safe environment and community.
