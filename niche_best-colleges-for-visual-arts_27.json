Personally I LOVE small class sizes. I'm a communications major with a minor is business management and law and ethics. I get minimal homework and have straight As on the deans list just for participating. I came to Marymount a 2.8 GPA student and now have a 3.6. I love all my professors and really made strong relationships with them. Being in New York has endless possibilities. Comm classes are easy and class options are great. If you want to be a comm major, COME TO MARYMOUNT! Corey Liberman is the gem of the school and the best professor a student could ask for.  It's not right for everyone because it's a small school and it's a city campus. The school is very cliquey but If you're outgoing you'll have no problems making friends. last thing is if you want party life you need a fake ID but can still have fun without one just not as much.

That being said, there are plenty of groups and organizations for everyone to feel involved and welcomed somewhere. \n\nProfessors genuinely care about students as individuals and many will make efforts to get to know you. Office hours are abundant and the professors are always willing to go over difficult material with students. Class sizes vary from 5 -20 students with few exceptions.\n\nThere are 5 dining areas on campus: one main dining hall and four smaller \"cafes\".

While diversity of the student population leaves something to be desired, Davidson is slowly improving.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2018-05-02T04:56:40.035205Z","guid":"a1640b05-25eb-482b-bc41-64af8fe060b1","rating":5},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":4.33}],"photos":{"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-80.845236,35.500006,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-80.845236,35.500006,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.8776978417266186,"count":278},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Davidson, NC"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/davidson-college/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"6914a222-c39a-473e-bcba-9b4f18457381","content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"Bloomfield College","type":"College","url":"bloomfield-college"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.6158},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":18718},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"770-950"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Freshman","body":"At first, I was a bit nervous coming all the way to Bloomfield from Camden.

The athletics are less than satisfactory however; because the university is so goal oriented towards educating students.

And, \"no,\" this review was not written by the school, but rather by a very impressed parent with very high standards.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2017-12-08T22:15:18.867032Z","guid":"1ac67ac8-8e8e-4310-b46e-9902cb1c9acb","rating":5},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":2.66}],"photos":{"default":{"crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/3a44ffa739b1c9de9e500455db541b4b244afdb2.jpg","MobileHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/e2ac7b6888efe5e2557a0dd028adf61ea21c308a.jpg"},"licenseName":"UNLICENSED"},"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-73.718316,41.031054,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-73.718316,41.031054,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.414004914004914,"count":814},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Purchase, NY"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/manhattanville-college/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"b34d9c6d-4b93-4da7-a020-6c878b093ccf","content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"Eastern Oregon University","type":"College","url":"eastern-oregon-university"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.9703},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":14973},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"830-1040"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Junior","body":"It is a small, quaint college.

The only thing I would want differently is that the school would have a football team, so we could have a marching band!","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2018-03-02T01:31:06.440547Z","guid":"0b2de3a9-3172-4142-a89d-06b126c7845c","rating":5},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":3.33}],"photos":{"default":{"crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/f89f48931df54cba9e526a93bdeab17384a1de16.jpg","MobileHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/400648e82ea85beba6d2c85f4c13659283156ee1.jpg"},"licenseName":"UNLICENSED"},"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-88.858524,35.676896,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-88.858524,35.676896,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.8061889250814334,"count":614},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Jackson, TN"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/union-university/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"feb8814f-9ea8-4eb1-a17c-05cc7f167b53","content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"Berea College","type":"College","url":"berea-college"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.328},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":2862},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"1000-1220"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Sophomore","body":"There has been a lot of opportunities come to me just from being college.  However, one of the best things about Berea is that students have the option to apply to study abroad.  Also, since I am in the music department (music minor), I get to see amazing professionals perform in front of my very eyes! I am so blessed by this and encouraged by these talented people every day to improve at the piano and singing.  I suppose one thing that I would like to see change here at Berea is everyone taking advantage of what they have.  Berea College has a lot to offer, and it would do my heart well if people could really understand how blessed they are.  Other than that, I have enjoyed being a student here and being a part of this community very much.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2018-01-10T19:34:35.293381Z","guid":"cf4b04f6-8efc-4646-a21f-5ed689c85cfb","rating":5},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":3.33}],"photos":{"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-84.289332,37.573334,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-84.289332,37.573334,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.2128146453089244,"count":437},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Berea, KY"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/berea-college/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"bd08d6d0-56d9-427e-9b27-40d6a06c017f","content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":true,"isPremium":true,"name":"Meredith College","type":"College","url":"meredith-college"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.6079},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":25597},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"920-1123"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Freshman","body":"Their welcoming environment and supportive community is perfect for helping me grow and flourish as an artist, honing and perfecting my skills to the highest possible quality.

The teachers I've met are kind and welcoming, and based on the classroom size they make sure you're not a face lost in the crowd; they want to have a personal relationship with you and make sure that you succeed in the career you want to aspire for.
