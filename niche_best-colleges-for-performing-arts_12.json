Must students there work while attending classes.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2018-02-23T05:17:33.902169Z","guid":"4c80399b-2b32-4927-8165-98a2f71ff7d1","rating":5},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":3}],"photos":{"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-71.038653,42.314541,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-71.038653,42.314541,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.3898148148148146,"count":1080},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Boston, MA"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/university-of-massachusetts---boston/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"84e95c64-dae6-433c-bd0e-58a67326ea19","content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":true,"isPremium":true,"name":"Kean University","type":"College","url":"kean-university"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.744},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":16164},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"830-1010"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Junior","body":"I am a first semester transfer student and so far i have really enjoyed my time here . Cannot beat the small class sizes and professor attention. Coming from Rutgers university i really appreciate that. Not as cutthroat as rutgers or other schools. I also actually like that each professor takes attendance and counts it as ten percent or more, of your grade. This encourages class attendance and pushes their students to do well. It is very possible to get a 4.0 if you show up to class and put in the effort, which for some classes requires less work than others.  I gave 4/5 because of the parking situation although they are trying to improve this situation by adding across the street parking. Parking is available but you may need to walk a bit or take the shuttle from other parts of campus. I also received 150$ cougar dollars because i was taking a saturday course which is awesome and very helpful for a broke college students!","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2017-10-08T21:38:46.586276Z","guid":"d6dc4cb1-4607-4bec-83c2-53169838cc8f","rating":4},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":2.66}],"photos":{"default":{"crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/859a4d9d0796621f891ab53ccda6c6fd903ed3a4.jpg","MobileHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/f07fa8da1eafb01ef2100eaac2340260ff021fcc.jpg"},"licenseName":"UNLICENSED"},"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-74.234668,40.679429,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-74.234668,40.679429,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.5614320585842147,"count":1229},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Union, NJ"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/kean-university/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"ffe91bed-0e98-41b2-8906-d20c215ff84b","content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"Cleveland State University","type":"College","url":"cleveland-state-university"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.8745},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":15555},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"890-1160"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Freshman","body":"I love the class sizes because you're able to build more personal relationships with your professors and get one on one attention if needed.

Do. Make a Difference. That is the motto of my current college, St. Cloud State University. Here, the professors genuinely enjoy the field that they were teaching and want their students to succeed in it, too. Within the first month of the 2016-2017 academic school year, there have been a number of different events for students to attend in which they can meet other students, enjoy free activities, and have an involvement on campus. As recently reported on the news, my community has recently undergone a traumatic occurrence at the local mall ten minutes away. Eight people were stabbed, none of which were students at the university, and the assailant was killed on site. Since this, the community has really come together to work through this difficult time. Within the past few days, the school has offered many opportunities for gatherings in which students and faculty could find some light in this time of darkness. The school genuinely cares. I would recommend this school to anyone looking for an affordable, amazing college experience. St. Cloud State University is a school that I would choose time and time again.

I enjoyed analyzing the characteristics of students with learning disabilities and the various approaches and methods used to foster ideal learning environments in the classroom. I had the opportunity to learn from professors who exemplify what they teach, and benefited from hands on experience to implement what I have learned. My professors and the entire college are so understanding, thoughtful, and caring. They want to help you succeed and work with you. They even called me in Florida to make sure I was okay and offer extended deadlines after Hurricane Irma. This is also the cheapest, quickest way to get my degree and really learn my stuff so I can be the most educated, experienced, and effective educator I can be.

Class sizes are relatively small the professor to student ratio is about 14:1. Small classes allow students to get he individual help that they might need or want. The educational benefits of YSU are amazing for a same state university. \nAlthough, there are somethings I would like to see change. There are not a lot of students that live on campus, there are only three dorm buildings in total. It almost feels like a commuter school in the sense that there are a lot of students that just go to class and then drive home. Weekends are very quiet and there aren't a lot of parties going on mostly because of the lack of students on campus. But, there is some change happening! YSU is building new apartment building the students can stay in. There are three apartment complexes around campus, University Edge, University Courtyards and they are build The Enclave.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2018-01-24T01:32:35.918307Z","guid":"78d2a013-3d7d-4c4b-9ed7-008f4de5ba5f","rating":4},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":2.66}],"photos":{"default":{"crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/ec6d071a1123c50daa4893e11be6a754c68ade5e.jpg","MobileHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/54a7fa7d83aa7f5def609bf299c699913f1ec09f.jpg"},"licenseName":"UNLICENSED"},"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-80.646515,41.105583,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-80.646515,41.105583,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.4008264462809916,"count":1210},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Youngstown, OH"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/youngstown-state-university/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"cae448eb-a4c6-4e01-afd9-c2e8e8afb88b","content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":true,"isPremium":false,"name":"University of Minnesota Duluth","type":"College","url":"university-of-minnesota-duluth"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.7655},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":15664},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"970-1210"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Freshman","body":"At the University of Minnesota - Duluth, everyone is very welcoming!

The only thing I would change is to have more police officers present at night near the library for people who walk back to their dorms alone.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2018-01-31T18:17:00.628444Z","guid":"068da44f-58a8-49a6-8ad9-9189f7508c82","rating":5},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":3}],"photos":{"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-92.45931,35.078196,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-92.45931,35.078196,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.661257606490872,"count":1479},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Conway, AR"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/university-of-central-arkansas/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"83fdeea4-e9d4-42c3-b96a-5fe852f06a3a","content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"Marquette University","type":"College","url":"marquette-university"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.8434},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":33502},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"1040-1270"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Niche User","body":"My college visit was an amazing experience! Everyone was very helpful and caring. All of my questions were answered and I am in love with the school. The location is perfect with having a urban lifestyle with suburban people. The campus is located only 1 mile away from Lake Michigan for summer fun and there are also numerous activities that can be done during the summer months, such as going to their D1 basketball team. Everyone has great school spirit and safety is tremendous since they have an almost 24 hour limo service that will ensure that you make it back to your dorm after a cheer-filled game or long night of studying in their wonderful library.    I recommend everyone looking into this college when they are applying.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2018-01-01T19:42:26.362584Z","guid":"9c3f07e7-6513-490c-b660-968f4077529f","rating":5},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":4}],"photos":{"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-87.928121,43.038766,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-87.928121,43.038766,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.5583377730420884,"count":1877},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Milwaukee, WI"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/marquette-university/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"afcf58a6-20f6-4e29-b277-eff4aaf6d24a","content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":true,"isPremium":false,"name":"Western Carolina University","type":"College","url":"western-carolina-university"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.4069},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":13646},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"910-1120"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Freshman","body":"The breath-snatching views of North Carolina's finest mountains are the first thing you wake up to in the morning, starting off every day with a view of what the real world looks like. Brown cafeteria is the hotspot destination due to its fresh food, beautiful architecture, and brand new everything. Afternoons and evenings can be spent enjoying membership in the many clubs and organizations on campus that truly make WCU thrive. Academically, WCU exists as only one of two colleges to offer a minor in leadership -a highly recommended 18-credit program for all. The School of Stage & Screen is one of the nation's top programs for anything theatre, and members of the school will stress this (however, the school's undertakings speak for itself). The Honors College just celebrated its 20th anniversary, and continues to stand out among higher ed institutions for its dedication to research and involvement. WCU is perhaps the most welcoming mountain college in the world!","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2018-01-04T19:50:29.312871Z","guid":"9cfb3272-33d8-4a4a-a4dc-f845cf9821d0","rating":5},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":3.33}],"photos":{"default":{"crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/042f4d2b4fc144d372a5847733babbde23659d22.jpg","MobileHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/05f55d6520b619418abc4f791d37380e37e15780.jpg"},"licenseName":"UNLICENSED"},"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-83.125447,35.28149,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-83.125447,35.28149,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.693548387096774,"count":1302},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Cullowhee, NC"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/western-carolina-university/#scatterplot"}}]}
