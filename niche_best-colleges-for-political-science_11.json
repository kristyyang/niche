The people here are unique, accepting and fun to be around! The professors truly care about helping you, and always there to talk to you and help you in any way, even when it's not their office hours. The food options on campus and around the town of Boone are amazing. Most things are locally grown and harvested, with plenty of Vegan/Vegetarian and gluten free/allergy free options. The atmosphere on campus and through out the whole community is one of adventure and excitement. The students really enjoy getting outside and getting active. The Blue Ridge Parkway has some of the best views in the United States, but I may be a little biased!

In addition to memories, the staff had a profound impact on me and how I carry myself to this day. Whether it be an intro class or a more fine-tuned 400-level class, each professor that has given a lecture to me has granted me the opportunity of hearing new insight and viewing the world in a fresh perspective. \n\nI resided in Ellicott Complex, which served as shelter for my first-year experience.

Professors care and work with you.  Many repeatedly encourage students to visit offices.  Very open. Running trail by cornfields,  wetlands to explore, two lakes, a cemetery, woods, and school is only 2-10 minutes from Walmart/The Mall/etc (Many job opps aside from work study).  Mass held in the basilica on Sunday. Professors are also VERY FRIENDLY monks that live on campus.  Don't feel pressured if not religious, no requirements.\n\nMiscellaneous:\nAthletics huge here.

My campus has a block party in Denver since it's right across the street where music and food is provided, along with tables and tents promoting all the clubs and organizations available on campus. These events continue throughout the year and make it fun and exciting to try new things.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2016-08-30T21:31:58Z","guid":"f92e489b-57f9-4d0d-aef6-fe4da407dbaf","rating":4},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":3.66}],"photos":{"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-104.999181,39.74603,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-104.999181,39.74603,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.545918367346939,"count":1568},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Denver, CO"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/university-of-colorado---denver/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"7cdaccaa-4888-4f76-9352-28998c237e6c","content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"Wittenberg University","type":"College","url":"wittenberg-university"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.7832},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":25325},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"1040-1240"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Freshman","body":"I really love this University! I wouldn’t go anywhere else. This is a very fun campus that also is very educationally involved. A lot of students drop their first year, due to academics. But if you stay, you are given so many opportunities here. The job placement rate is extremely high! The athletics here don’t disappoint us either. I would recommend this campus to people who like to work hard but love to have fun.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2018-05-09T15:11:16.542546Z","guid":"8f0c0c3d-1ca9-4642-b691-34b0450a3aaf","rating":5},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":3.33}],"photos":{"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-83.814082,39.937463,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-83.814082,39.937463,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.6795977011494254,"count":696},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Springfield, OH"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/wittenberg-university/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"c22feca2-515f-4ae6-84a0-fe2af91f6c4b","content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":true,"isPremium":true,"name":"Quinnipiac University","type":"College","url":"quinnipiac-university"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.69},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":37439},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"980-1190"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Sophomore","body":"One thing I always loved about Quinnipiac University is the beauty of its campus! It is such a relaxing environment and you never get bored of looking at that view. Quinnipiac was a very convenient choice for me because I was planning on being a commuter and the campus is close to home. In my second year here, I can say with certainty that everyone here is so friendly and always willing to help you. The professors are amazing and they will do everything they can to make sure you are understanding the concepts and succeeding academically. Another interesting thing about Quinnipiac is that it has many clubs and organizations available. In this way, each student can definitely find something that matches their hobbies and interests. And lastly, I am glad I chose Quinnipiac because it offers such an interesting major, which is Behavioral Neuroscience. I recently declared it and I can't wait to explore it further more in the months to come!","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2017-10-02T17:40:43.034339Z","guid":"3bd64d3d-094c-49df-942d-ca0a22242104","rating":5},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":3.33}],"photos":{"default":{"crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/c961c711b4b64bfd61847d72217c707792e082b6.jpg","MobileHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/0aeb2577dea0abc6367c8101d8e600c38c3a97f5.jpg"},"licenseName":"UNLICENSED"},"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-72.895542,41.419527,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-72.895542,41.419527,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.507514450867052,"count":1730},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Hamden, CT"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/quinnipiac-university/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"46ba506a-4c6e-4ecd-9873-7af476e7788e","content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"Rutgers University - Newark","type":"College","url":"rutgers-university---newark"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.6531},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":10771},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"910-1100"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Sophomore","body":"Rutgers University is a great college for students looking for diversity, great education, and an overall amazing college experience. Throughout my year and a half at Rutgers, Newark I’ve enjoyed the diversity of my peers, the amazing professors, and the curriculum taught on campus. Overall, I love attending Rutger University, everyone on campus from students to professors make my college experience as enjoyable as it can be. Rutgers University is dedicated to bettering their students and making them feel comfortable. Their exciting events held on campus to encourage students to have some fun here and there and take a break from the stress school can cause.
