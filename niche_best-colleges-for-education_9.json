The welcoming vibe doesn't end when you leave the campus, though. Even in my online classes, I can feel the warmth of professors and classmates that care about me.

I have had wonderful professors and the campus and surrounding area is beautiful with lots to do.  There is a wide range of student diversity and lots of career choices and activities to get involved with.  However, the dorms could use some major updating!  When compared to dorms at other colleges that friends attend, Lee's housing/dorms and below par.  My parents like that this college seems to be safe and isn't known to be a big party scene place.  The campus food is just normal college food, nothing special.  I have made some great friends, while at Lee, from other states and countries.  I am glad that chose Lee University but wish that the tuition was a little more affordable to reduce the amount of loans that I will have once I graduate.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2018-05-23T16:31:42.823318Z","guid":"1e45edfc-8e71-4671-aae2-cce41af75a38","rating":5},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":3}],"photos":{"default":{"crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/9169e20c314d8846e6dc72a471c7d12547bdf516.jpg","MobileHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/dc6e23d18b183d95c912d4e01bcd64dc796472b8.jpg"},"licenseName":"UNLICENSED"},"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-84.870018,35.166166,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-84.870018,35.166166,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.7564549895324495,"count":1433},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Cleveland, TN"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/lee-university/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"cae448eb-a4c6-4e01-afd9-c2e8e8afb88b","badge":{"display":"Best Colleges for Education in America","ordinal":215,"total":756,"vanityURL":"best-colleges-for-education"},"content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":true,"isPremium":false,"name":"University of Minnesota Duluth","type":"College","url":"university-of-minnesota-duluth"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.7655},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":15664},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"970-1210"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Freshman","body":"At the University of Minnesota - Duluth, everyone is very welcoming!

The thing that I have found frustrating is that some student advisors are not helpful at all and haven't necessarily steered me in the right direction.

Another pro is that since its a small school, everybody knows everybody for the most part, and everybody is very friendly. For this reason, its also easy to make and find friends, and you'll see the usual students you see around the usual times you see them when you go to the cafeteria, the lair, the gym, or the library.\nThe Freshmen dorms, the walls are VERY thin, you literally could hear everything so it could get annoying if your floor or neighbors are loud and you want to sleep, study, or just want some peace and quiet.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2018-06-02T18:05:05.687909Z","guid":"2b702cec-ed70-418f-b294-d8d325c942f7","rating":4},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":3.66}],"photos":{"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-121.307296,37.980624,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-121.307296,37.980624,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.5813544415127527,"count":1137},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Stockton, CA"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/university-of-the-pacific/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"e418d93d-fc7f-4b07-b6fa-de2a6acdb946","badge":{"display":"Best Colleges for Education in America","ordinal":221,"total":756,"vanityURL":"best-colleges-for-education"},"content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"Northern Illinois University","type":"College","url":"northern-illinois-university"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.5184},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":19782},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"900-1120"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Freshman","body":"I'm currently a Music Education major.

If youre not a partier, thats cool too, there is always SO much going on campus youre sure to have fun without drinking. The city itself is a neat, they recently received a 10 million dollar grant to renovate downtown. Huge economy boost. Syracuse's Destiny mall is a half hour away and SUNY Cortland sponsors trips to go there so if you or your friends dont have a car, you’re good. Ithaca is 25 minutes away and is a very cool town, theres trails to hike and its great if you just want to get away from Cortland for the day","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2018-02-08T20:55:20.899402Z","guid":"7edfedbc-29a7-45b9-82ee-3edf1f1d12d4","rating":4},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":2.66}],"photos":{"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-76.197909,42.590158,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-76.197909,42.590158,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.55484693877551,"count":784},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Cortland, NY"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/suny-cortland/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"49001607-bdee-4b32-a883-764faec11548","badge":{"display":"Best Colleges for Education in America","ordinal":228,"total":756,"vanityURL":"best-colleges-for-education"},"content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":true,"isPremium":false,"name":"SUNY New Paltz","type":"College","url":"suny-new-paltz"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.4294},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":14605},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"1010-1200"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Sophomore","body":"I've loved every minute of being a student here. I feel like it really is possible to do whatever makes you happy without being judged. I'm not the typical sorority girl at all, but I am in a sorority here. I also do theatre, and these don't conflict at all! The sojourner truth library is pretty much my second home at this point considering how much time I spend there. The campus is incredibly beautiful and I find myself amazed at it every day.The classrooms are well kept and the professors are all incredible. The work load is rigorous but definitely manageable. The food is not always the best, but after your freshman year when you change your meal plan it gets significantly better. The night life isn't dead as some other posts said, you just have to know of what's going on! There's always either a frat party or a house show going on! On that note, you could also probably get into p&gs bar using a Pokémon card.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2017-12-24T06:19:45.813179Z","guid":"e8c3ad47-85d9-41c9-811e-51da017d5f4f","rating":5},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":3}],"photos":{"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-74.088727,41.737205,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-74.088727,41.737205,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.6121970289288505,"count":1279},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"New Paltz, NY"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/suny-new-paltz/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"4fee8a81-f443-4769-9bcf-6c7f1e8579b9","badge":{"display":"Best Colleges for Education in America","ordinal":229,"total":756,"vanityURL":"best-colleges-for-education"},"content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"Saint Martin's University","type":"College","url":"saint-martins-university"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.9531},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":21605},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"895-1150"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Alum","body":"SMU gives many scholarships.
