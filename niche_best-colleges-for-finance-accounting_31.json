They have a variety of clubs and organizations that help and assist students involve themselves in activities and internships!  Our staff members involve themselves as much as possible in order for students to find their right major. We are a big family , regardless of how small we are. Also, I will never get tired of saying this... Everyone is nice. Texas Wesleyan is a diverse, fun and successful University. We have late night activities, for example, bonfires, cookouts, \"Naked but Real\", (students come out to share there art pieces including poems, songs etc.) sand volleyball, free shirts, free meals on occasions and tea!

Although the teachers may also be strict they try their best to make lectures, labs & etc fun. UVI is also filled with opportunities. UVI has work studies & they have so much programs that can help students be the best at what they want to be. My only complaint is that they don't have much activities for students.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2018-01-29T15:21:45.534153Z","guid":"d196d0a4-fb64-41f7-a88a-3165d552ca91","rating":4},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade"}],"photos":{"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-64.972866,18.344193,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-64.972866,18.344193,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.368995633187773,"count":458},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Charlotte Amalie, VI"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/university-of-the-virgin-islands/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"7b358a5b-c886-44ea-9bb4-e600eb8af12f","content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"Andrews University","type":"College","url":"andrews-university"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.4042},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":22012},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"930-1270"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Freshman","body":"I have only been to Andrews for a year so far and I absolutely love it here! I have not visited many other colleges before so I am not going to say that this is the best one, however I am going to say that it is a great school. The atmosphere is nice, the campus is beautiful, and there are many things to do on campus. The facilities are all very nice, modern, and clean, and there is almost always something to do on campus. I was actually faced with the opportunity to transfer to another school that would be closer to home, but I just couldn't bring myself to doing it because this school did not compare to Andrews. \nAnother thing about Andrews is that it is very diverse--that is one of the major things that I enjoy the most. I have many friends from the united states, Brazil, Rwanda, Kenya, China, Russia and many other people. This school is absolutely great!","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2017-01-12T02:16:56.877115Z","guid":"d4e828a4-f18e-4101-9726-84384b3bdb1c","rating":5},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":3.33}],"photos":{"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-86.355149,41.963266,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-86.355149,41.963266,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.3194748358862145,"count":457},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Berrien Springs, MI"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/andrews-university/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"d0f99d70-e991-434a-a22b-d01ba983143d","content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"Chaminade University of Honolulu","type":"College","url":"chaminade-university-of-honolulu"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.9133},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":18660},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"870-1060"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Sophomore","body":"Chaminade University of Honolulu has small class, so you can get your questions answered.
