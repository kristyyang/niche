UCSC is also very close to the ocean, making it a great location for those who love to frequent the beach.  Aside from location, I have had great experiences academically with this school.  All of my professors have been extremely kind and genuinely interested in the wellbeing and learning process of their students.  Finally, UCSC is a school that is extremely accepting of people from all different backgrounds, sexual orientations, and cultures and strives to make all students feel welcome.

Even as a commuter, \"welcome week\" was the perfect break-me-out-of-my-shell experience I needed to feel comfortable in going to college here, at UMBC. And it didn't stop there! Every semester the school creates a new way to include its students from all walks of life. There are many organizations that are eager to gain new recruits; there are always emails and chalk drawings that invite people to join the UMBC community or show your Retriever Pride; and there are so many safe, private places to study or just relax without feeling like you're in the middle of nowhere.\nNot to mention you are a short bus-ride away from plenty of off-campus attractions, if you ever feel the need to escape campus life (many of these excursions are even organized by  the Student Events Board). \nThis is the perfect small campus, with a big college feel.

I had no direction, no motivation, and no confidence which quickly led to my demise. Finally, over three years later, I now have realized my path and it has absolutely nothing to do with CSU or politics. I am sure it's a great school with tons to offer if you apply yourself, but to be honest I got very little out of my education there and feel like I may have waisted a lot of time and money during my 7 year stint at Colorado State University.

Many classes are discussion-based, making them very engaging. Campus is small & it only takes about 5 minutes to walk to class from most dorms. Lexington is a wonderful place to be, although pretty unsafe, which leads me to say that the safety on campus could improve, but that will likely happen soon as a result of an attack that occurred earlier this year. Dining locations on campus currently have unusual hours & sometimes students find that they want food when dining locations are closed, but Lexington as a whole has several nearby restaurants students can order from with their own money. Also, many cheaper housing options were closed down for next year so students will live in the brand-new dorms, which makes it harder for students to find affordable housing. Overall, though, I'd recommend this university to anyone who wants to go to a smaller school and/or live in a bigger city, and especially to artists because Lexington is a very artistic city.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2017-07-27T01:57:05.316293Z","guid":"4c908b63-69b0-4011-af13-ff14c0f24b5f","rating":5},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":3.33}],"photos":{"default":{"crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/8f36cce8c68337eb4666ce7eb7df61d7c92fc0bc.jpg","MobileHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/60571fb9bf154b85b95af6b752884503de2a182d.jpg"},"licenseName":"UNLICENSED"},"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-84.493883,38.053236,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-84.493883,38.053236,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.7111111111111112,"count":270},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Lexington, KY"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/transylvania-university/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"641d33dd-e6a1-453a-a16b-ddde53dbe00c","content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"University of Vermont","type":"College","url":"university-of-vermont"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.6894},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":17816},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"1100-1300"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Sophomore","body":"UVM is an excellent college.

There are so many opportunities to study abroad, whether it is during interim, the summer, or a semester.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2018-05-30T17:00:06.095684Z","guid":"d6ac7aa0-680e-4ff7-988a-7e92944f91ca","rating":5},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":3.66}],"photos":{"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-81.934572,34.957914,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-81.934572,34.957914,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.7582089552238807,"count":335},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Spartanburg, SC"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/wofford-college/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"2b800762-3b08-4808-b2c8-39888ccbd792","content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":true,"isPremium":false,"name":"Yeshiva University","type":"College","url":"yeshiva-university"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.5075},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":30968},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"1090-1360"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Graduate Student","body":"Cool university with experienced teachers, which are always ready to help their students in any situation.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2018-01-31T08:35:43.426771Z","guid":"6d94bbe8-3dc7-4f2b-b1fd-2ef8164a23c4","rating":5},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":4}],"photos":{"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-73.928541,40.8508,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-73.928541,40.8508,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.5703125,"count":256},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"New York, NY"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/yeshiva-university/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"9cc014a9-3692-4d88-977d-119e2d1cd45d","content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"Louisiana State University","type":"College","url":"louisiana-state-university"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.7639},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":15095},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"1010-1250"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Junior","body":"LSU has been the greatest experience of my life.

However,  I have been pleasantly surprised over and over again here. The professors are extremely qualified in their fields and the small class size makes it super easy to get a more personal and engaging learning experience. The student body is diverse not only in their ethnic background but also socioeconomically, politically and their interest. I am a member of the swimming and track team along with balancing a double major and a radio show. The passion among the students here, especially the studnet-atheletes is contagious, and it wasn't long before I found myself passionate not only about my course but also my studies.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2017-02-15T23:50:07.468826Z","guid":"708322dd-dd11-441e-b17c-925f2d025d4c","rating":5},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":3.33}],"photos":{"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-75.455654,40.19405,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-75.455654,40.19405,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.548463356973995,"count":423},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Collegeville, PA"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/ursinus-college/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"f1dc8d0e-2693-406c-a2bf-b626777a7809","content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"University of Arizona","type":"College","url":"university-of-arizona"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.7862},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":16466},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"983-1230"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Junior","body":"The University of Arizona is an amazing opportunity that a lot of people can overlook. This institution has world-class professors and equipment in fields such as engineering, astrology, optics, and more. The strong athletic programs at the U fo A also bolster the school spirit and makes it easy to get fired up at sporting events with your schoolmate. As a student, you also have the best opportunity to mingle and network with industry professionals throughout the school year. Companies consistently send representative directly to the school for seminars and job fairs with the sole purpose of finding a college student to potentially employ. Having the chance to land an internship or even get a job offer at the U of A can often be a simple as showing up to a school event! To summarize, the University of Arizona is an amazing opportunity for anyone looking to get a world-class education in an environment where employers often come directly to you.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2018-03-01T03:25:26.123698Z","guid":"092f1096-7bb8-4ba8-852f-05209f1ef07f","rating":4},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":3.66}],"photos":{"default":{"author":"iagoarchangel","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/50d9d513c48381c6ba4939908c60bbd3ac3a4631.jpg","MobileHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/0c9c05adf4b9e9ce85277fdbe92468b57d06a2e7.jpg","Thumbnail":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/375760a6d8ec09f2b2b89cb9f9f2d14e6e577f2e"},"licenseName":"CC BY-SA","licenseUrl":"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/","sourceUrl":"https://www.flickr.com/photos/iagoarchangel/8608390310/"},"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-110.950769,32.232071,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-110.950769,32.232071,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.7181506849315067,"count":5840},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Tucson, AZ"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/university-of-arizona/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"83fdeea4-e9d4-42c3-b96a-5fe852f06a3a","content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"Marquette University","type":"College","url":"marquette-university"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.8434},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":33502},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"1040-1270"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Niche User","body":"My college visit was an amazing experience! Everyone was very helpful and caring. All of my questions were answered and I am in love with the school. The location is perfect with having a urban lifestyle with suburban people. The campus is located only 1 mile away from Lake Michigan for summer fun and there are also numerous activities that can be done during the summer months, such as going to their D1 basketball team. Everyone has great school spirit and safety is tremendous since they have an almost 24 hour limo service that will ensure that you make it back to your dorm after a cheer-filled game or long night of studying in their wonderful library.    I recommend everyone looking into this college when they are applying.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2018-01-01T19:42:26.362584Z","guid":"9c3f07e7-6513-490c-b660-968f4077529f","rating":5},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":4}],"photos":{"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-87.928121,43.038766,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-87.928121,43.038766,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.5583377730420884,"count":1877},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Milwaukee, WI"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/marquette-university/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"249cb36e-7275-4cec-b8c6-6984b50eb8ce","content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"Coe College","type":"College","url":"coe-college"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.4995},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":21870},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"1020-1270"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Junior","body":"I absolutely love Coe!
