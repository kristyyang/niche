Students, alumnus, and even parents were all there with the same positive energy and enthusiasm. After becoming a student, I was able to fully experience what the university has to offer. The staff and administration work tirelessly to ensure the wellbeing of all their students academically, professionally and even emotionally. The curriculum and field based experiences are all set to better aid students in beginning, continuing, or changing their career.  Resources that are offered, such as the career center, help in this process as well.

I think many people assume because Mount is an expensive college, the students will be stuck up snobs. This is completely untrue. I have found the complete opposite to be true really.

Everyone I've interacted with have been exceptionally kind to one another. As funny as it is to say, the one thing that sticks out in my mind is the extreme lengths students go to to hold doors for others. The professors are always available and are able to relate well with students. Course material is difficult, but the atmosphere is full of resources and encouragement. I love being a Raider!","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2017-12-29T18:48:39.480277Z","guid":"73da08d2-0c06-4b75-a6f3-dd0533a62108","rating":5},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":3}],"photos":{"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-81.108624,40.905093,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-81.108624,40.905093,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.4296228150873964,"count":1087},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Alliance, OH"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/university-of-mount-union/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"3315f2a8-58f3-4321-b9c1-43b60a7099c7","content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"Purdue University Northwest - North Central","type":"College","url":"purdue-university-northwest---north-central"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.4992},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":6942},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"870-1050"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Junior","body":"It's a small campus, manicured and non intimidating. I have completed one full school year there so far, my reviews are a bit mixed. When I transferred I didn't find the classes to be challenging. The professors I've had have been well versed in their courses, personable and seem to sincerely enjoy teaching in a smaller classroom setting. There are numerous support programs for students that are all free, including counseling and tutoring. Since it's a commuter campus there are an extraordinarily large amount of sitting spots throughout campus for students to study and relax. Overall, I look forward to completing my undergrad program there.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2017-08-03T17:14:34.915027Z","guid":"bea16659-45f8-428b-a6ae-82c86492bcf1","rating":4},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":2.66}],"photos":{"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-86.89523,41.583788,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-86.89523,41.583788,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.4205128205128204,"count":390},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Westville, IN"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/purdue-university-northwest---north-central/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"3f492c07-a790-434c-b628-46a735bcc8e1","content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"Indiana University - Kokomo","type":"College","url":"indiana-university---kokomo"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.6913},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":8718},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"830-1030"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Freshman","body":"Overall, my experience at Indiana University Kokomo has been a learning experience. I feel welcomed on campus, but not included. It is admirable to see how the instructors and professors reach out to students to let them know they are available to help. Nonetheless, when walking from building to building and up and down the halls of the many buildings on campus I am once again reminded I'm here for an education. The environment makes one feel like it is not for socializing, perhaps small talk, but foremost to succeed in everything. I've considered transferring to another four year institution, but then I'm reminded if I want the best environment to study it would IUK. Where else could I find a campus where I feel safe whether I come really early,  have the opportunity to talk one on one with my professor and grow a relationship to have great recommendations, and many opportunities due to the number of \nstudents on campus.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2017-12-28T23:48:21.73246Z","guid":"d3471b18-e997-4eb7-8d6a-b49197034d7f","rating":4},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":2.66}],"photos":{"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-86.132096,40.459913,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-86.132096,40.459913,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.6496350364963503,"count":411},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Kokomo, IN"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/indiana-university---kokomo/#scatterplot"}}]}
