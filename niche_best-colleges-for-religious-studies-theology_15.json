They contact you within a short period of time to welcome you into the prospective Trojan family. I was invited to tour the campus as soon as I could, at my convenience. My Admissions Representative was extremely nice and informative. Every question or concern was answered. I was highly concerned over what UMO could offer me financially due to having a family that cannot easily support me. The Admissions Representative promised to try to get as much help for me as possible so I would be able to attend. Within a week of applying, I was accepted with a financial package! I toured the campus and it was absolutely beautiful!

Its a close knit school and very friendly csmpus. Academics are very good with small class sizes.  My daughter, who is African American, has made friends of all sorts and is involved in a lot. Sure, it does not have the big school sports scene but the college was top ranked in division two in severals sports. Security seems tight so far and there's a real emphasis on community service. If you want a school where the student will not get lost in a crowd and will get a very good foundation, Rockhurst is an under the radar gem with well respected academics as with most Jesuit colleges. Its not a commuter school even though its in an urban area. Campus is beautiful and not urban looking at all.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2017-08-26T05:03:14.500932Z","guid":"d2dcfbca-2735-4506-a1cb-af03240d0215","rating":5},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":3.66}],"photos":{"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-94.571249,39.030843,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-94.571249,39.030843,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.589080459770115,"count":348},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Kansas City, MO"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/rockhurst-university/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"4988fc1d-e175-4852-ae02-48c3b9607acb","content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":true,"isPremium":true,"name":"Belmont Abbey College","type":"College","url":"belmont-abbey-college"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.9737},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":23247},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"880-1090"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Freshman","body":"Belmont Abbey felt like home from the first time I set foot on campus my junior year of high school. It's a very Catholic school that adheres to the church teachings. Even though it is a Catholic campus, Belmont Abbey is very welcoming to everyone. It's really easy to make friends on such a small campus and you get back what you put in. There are ways to socialize and meet new people almost every night but if you don't go you'll never make friends. Many of the professors are amazing and care not only about your academics but your whole life. Everyone here is apart of a massive family and it's amazing. If you're wondering about the food on campus it's not the worst, it's proabably to the better end of food you'll find on a college campus. If there is one thing I recommend it's bringing a car if possible, it can be a little tedious being stuck on campus. Overall Belmont Abbey has been an amazing experience for me and I am loving every minute of it!","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2017-09-23T13:28:54.576685Z","guid":"7125b179-954a-415d-adce-b23eeb12cfd8","rating":5},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":2.66}],"photos":{"default":{"crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/da940c30620ec5341642315c3d3a55dacaf0fe17.jpg","MobileHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/ad0c73b165cb69af8cf4996c4cd103ff3b81e03e.jpg"},"licenseName":"UNLICENSED"},"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-81.041847,35.261276,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-81.041847,35.261276,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.8313953488372094,"count":172},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Belmont, NC"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/belmont-abbey-college/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"249cb36e-7275-4cec-b8c6-6984b50eb8ce","content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"Coe College","type":"College","url":"coe-college"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.4995},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":21870},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"1020-1270"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Junior","body":"I absolutely love Coe!

Before Beloit, she was only interested in taking classes as a means of getting to the next step.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2018-04-13T17:42:03.953566Z","guid":"46400989-a430-4d5b-93db-8bd2836b3b34","rating":5},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":3.33}],"photos":{"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-89.03147,42.50363,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-89.03147,42.50363,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.5596153846153844,"count":520},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Beloit, WI"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/beloit-college/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"1e404941-54e0-4e2f-9dbd-6d41b064bc96","content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"Morningside College","type":"College","url":"morningside-college"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.5693},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":21304},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"880-1120"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Niche User","body":"The college visit on their senior day was amazing!

Houghton is a tremendous place to meet people with whom you will relate professionally and personally for years to come.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2017-08-18T03:02:42.717132Z","guid":"3bdf7248-a925-45eb-b4f6-91817da4fd5d","rating":5},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":3}],"photos":{"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-78.156882,42.426841,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-78.156882,42.426841,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.6750700280112043,"count":357},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Houghton, NY"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/houghton-college/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"be87d8ff-7241-44bd-8302-e74a24797053","content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"Saint Joseph's College of Maine","type":"College","url":"saint-josephs-college-of-maine"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.7808},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":24875},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"810-1020"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Sophomore","body":"Although the campus is extremely small, it has its perks! The campus is beautiful and the view of  Sebago Lake is stunning. The short walk across campus makes the Maine winter months much easier, as well as helping us late risers get to classes on time. The sports teams all excel, but we could use more spectators at the games! Our academics are wonderful because our professors really get to know their students. The academic accommodations office is amazing at getting students the extra assistance they need in order to achieve greatness.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2018-05-30T03:22:32.481941Z","guid":"7c68d7b9-7b9a-4dbf-bda4-1f3a3ab74f84","rating":4},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":2.66}],"photos":{"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-70.483486,43.82651,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-70.483486,43.82651,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.2610619469026547,"count":226},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Standish, ME"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/saint-josephs-college-of-maine/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"4e3513a8-2577-4121-a918-6179240c68fe","content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"William Jewell College","type":"College","url":"william-jewell-college"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.5108},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":22782},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"980-1285"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Sophomore","body":"William Jewell College is my home. It is a community of students who want to critically think together to achieve scholarship and higher learning. I am a varsity athlete, involved in Greek life, the Pryor Leadership Program and other organizations on campus. This place has changed me for the better and taught me that college is more than parties and fraternities, but actually getting to know individuals around you to grow with. I already have internships lined up thanks to my excellent accounting professors. Love this place, please give it a shot after your first year.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2018-05-26T16:57:03.839268Z","guid":"2c508000-a23f-48d4-9fd0-939eb2070002","rating":5},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":3}],"photos":{"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-94.41207,39.247848,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-94.41207,39.247848,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.465045592705167,"count":329},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Liberty, MO"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/william-jewell-college/#scatterplot"}}]}
