Though the classes are much more challenging than I visioned, they are definitely worth the challenge because I am most assured that they will prepare me for my future responsibilities in the healthcare field.

The academics are really what make this school stand out from the rest.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2018-04-21T21:14:21.086788Z","guid":"ce74647e-4687-4340-ab9c-f90a1308f3bc","rating":5},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":2.66}],"photos":{"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-98.49077,45.482833,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-98.49077,45.482833,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.935251798561151,"count":139},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Aberdeen, SD"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/presentation-college/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"5898e94d-dfe7-41e9-b32a-bc649f5d2db1","content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"Kentucky Christian University","type":"College","url":"kentucky-christian-university"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.388},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":20290},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"810-1040"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Senior","body":"Kentucky Christian University has served me by being a place where I can grow spiritually, socially, and academically.

It is completely possible to challenge yourself academically here. In the science department, the professors are very highly qualified and teach the material very well. The staff here are all incredibly helpful and approachable. Rosemont is a small community where people all around campus know each other. People here genuinely want you to succeed. For undergraduate science students, research opportunities are incredibly accessible which is not common at large universities. I am only a freshman and already know the chair of my department well and plan to join her research team sophomore year. There are also many hospitals and medical facilities in the area where students can get volunteer hours. One thing about this school that is a positive aspect for me, but not everyone, is the lack of a large party scene. Overall, I would recommend Rosemont College to students who want to go to college to learn in a tight knit community.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2016-11-04T03:34:46.742052Z","guid":"7e742024-8989-4d49-bbd8-0ef73ea5d79b","rating":5},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":2}],"photos":{"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-75.329898,40.034771,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-75.329898,40.034771,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.161290322580645,"count":124},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Rosemont, PA"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/rosemont-college/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"9641eb37-8c80-41a9-8f9f-6520b000d08e","content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"Silver Lake College of the Holy Family","type":"College","url":"silver-lake-college-of-the-holy-family"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.5489},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":19989},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"893-998"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Freshman","body":"Being the first one in the family has been a very challenging situation for me.

The school has purchased all parking anywhere near the school and parking permits are needed everywhere. I tried to buy a parking permit but there were no more available. So I was forced to walk a mile to classes, and even still had to pay at parking meters. I didn't mind the walk, but sometimes could not find parking. Another thing I didn't appreciate is that there are no places where I could pump my breast milk, since I am a breastfeeding momma.

As far as academics my classes are small, personal, and most of my teachers are beyond great.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2018-04-02T21:55:59.407644Z","guid":"82779b0d-b2cc-4f6b-bd37-94a1b428e898","rating":5},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":3}],"photos":{"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-85.950191,31.800128,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-85.950191,31.800128,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.6317626527050613,"count":1719},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Troy, AL"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/troy-university/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"04b96d74-4243-448d-b842-0c4e6a1dfe97","content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"California State University - Dominguez Hills","type":"College","url":"california-state-university---dominguez-hills"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.4791},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":3297},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"760-940"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Senior","body":"Dominguez Hills has paved the road for my physical therapy career.

The professors actually care about their jobs and their students. Cleveland State is located in downtown Cleveland so there are many different attractions including restaurants, stores , museums, bars , parks you name it!  Another thing I really love about CSU is the advisory services as a first generation freshman I felt very supported as far as preparation as well as financial help. The party scene is not really great but otherwise all around great school .","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2018-01-04T18:59:54.477988Z","guid":"8f555611-b493-47ca-b05b-b59ce9d9f426","rating":4},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":3}],"photos":{"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-81.673052,41.502918,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-81.673052,41.502918,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.5335384615384613,"count":1625},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Cleveland, OH"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/cleveland-state-university/#scatterplot"}}]}
