There were at least 3 emails about guys running from police or something, but the Columbia College Police Department keeps us safe. As for the party scene, you're gonna have to go to University of South Carolina or Five Points. Bring a friend if you're going to Five Points, though.

Class sizes are normally small enough that professors can talk to and interact with students on a one-on-one basis to answer questions, to provide assistance, to facilitate conversation, and to even assist with opportunities. With more than seventy individual majors and the opportunities to earn multiple majors, students definitely have not only variety but choice to maximize the opportunities afforded to them to achieve their dreams. The Office of Undergraduate Research has been instrumental in allowing students to travel, to present research, and network, and students are often more than prepared to attend graduate schools and to fill the vacant job and/or leadership positions available after college.

The courses were exactly what I was looking for and we even got to work with real clients in the Burlington area. This brings me to my second point, job placement and connections. I know the reason I decided to go to college was to broaden my opportunity for employment. There are so many opportunities to network, get internships, or gain experience that will help you when looking for jobs post-graduation. My final point is the campus. Visiting Campus is a MUST!

Saint Leo also is very good with keeping up with students throughout the year and making sure they stay on track. The staff is always very helpful and kind. If I could change anything it would be that the school would have a football team.

Most teachers in that area did seem to care, but oftentimes I found they weren't able to teach the material quite as well as teachers in other areas. It would either be extremely difficult, with teachers going completely over my head, or very, very easy, with the teacher practically going back to basic high school math. It'd be nice to see some more focus on that area and to see it improve some.\nBut overall, this college has a very welcoming and warm environment and I'd recommend it to anyone looking for a good start to college.

The campus life was always buzzing with free lunch socials, carnivals in the campus park, guest speakers, and other activities to allow students to become more engaged as well as prepare for future plans. I never encountered a problem regarding a safety issue or complained about a professor’s approach to a topic. I would highly reccomend ULM to anyone and everyone considering a 4-year university!","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2018-05-23T00:40:20.803639Z","guid":"352b9855-a5e8-4a9d-9925-a2d98d9f81e9","rating":5},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":3}],"photos":{"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-92.073855,32.527957,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-92.073855,32.527957,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.5638629283489096,"count":642},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Monroe, LA"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/university-of-louisiana---monroe/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"a209079b-4865-4370-bbab-ed182457f1c2","badge":{"display":"Best Colleges in America","ordinal":774,"total":1644,"vanityURL":"best-colleges"},"content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"Merrimack College","type":"College","url":"merrimack-college"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.8191},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":33003},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"930-1120"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Senior","body":"Merrimack College is a small community where you see the same helpful and friendly faces everyday around campus. Merrimack actually allows students to voice their opinions and is constantly improving. Merrimack is where I have made close relationships with professors who have written me wonderful letters of recommendations, which helped me get into law school. I have also met wonderful life long friends here. Merrimack college has provided me with exceptional academic preparation for the real world and stresses the importance of internships and jobs. Merrimack will set you up with a paid internship to help further your career, as most jobs want experience upon hiring. Merrimack also allows you to join a variety of club and meet a diverse set of people.

The university was built in the 1850's and is one of the oldest in the West Coast college systems!\n\nSJSU is VERY WELL CONTAINED I.e. Campus housing; academic, social and athletic activities; campus police/policing; MANY food choices. There is definitely not a need or reason for  FROSH (freshmen) to leave campus. \n\nWe love the university is DIVERSE ethnically, academically and socially.  SJSU is centrally located in the heart of San Jose. It's surrounded by a lot of great culture and beautiful old architecture.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2017-10-02T00:07:17.300014Z","guid":"1826660a-ddd3-40d9-ad4b-d561d111425c","rating":5},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":2.66}],"photos":{"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-121.881214,37.335201,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-121.881214,37.335201,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.5340785169029445,"count":3668},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"San Jose, CA"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/san-jose-state-university/#scatterplot"}}]}
