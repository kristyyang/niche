Here are they:\n1. My first choice is chemical engineering and I always adored to conduct researches in laboratories. Therefore, when I applied to colleges first of all I looked if they have a good undergraduate research opportunities. In MIT with the help UROP I could start researching even from freshman class.\n2. Its pass no record style of educating freshmen. There is no grading in the first semester. Instead, one gets \"Pass\" or \"Fail\" in his or her transcript. It allows students not to stress too much on grades, but explore the university and majors.\n3. Of course it is the best university in the field of chemical engineering. Top notch professors, smart peers and the best laboratories makes MIT unique.\n4. It's financially available for all international students. MIT's need blind policy makes it affordable for all who want to attend it.\n\nI hope it helps!","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2017-12-28T19:46:12.988166Z","guid":"6a2f1b8a-1afe-4ef8-944b-b2dd08d2ab87","rating":5},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":4.33}],"photos":{"default":{"author":"justinjensen","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/9e4d828e5f5cfe5eac16bdee876a58919082288f.jpg","MobileHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/3dbd39d4c1401beb7773c38566cc4d728d7db4ed.jpg","Thumbnail":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/557facfa37e7e3a49d452635d811fd839d0145b2"},"licenseName":"CC BY ","licenseUrl":"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/2.0/","sourceUrl":"https://www.flickr.com/photos/justinjensen/4979561102/in/album-72157623671307590/"},"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-71.092115,42.360095,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-71.092115,42.360095,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":4.078859060402684,"count":596},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Cambridge, MA"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/massachusetts-institute-of-technology/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"e3c7da9f-a6d3-4951-bfbb-6049c2ac56e2","badge":{"display":"Best Colleges for Computer Science in America","ordinal":2,"total":494,"vanityURL":"best-colleges-for-computer-science"},"content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"Stanford University","type":"College","url":"stanford-university"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.0481},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":16695},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"1380-1580"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Freshman","body":"Stanford is a beautiful, welcoming place where everyone is welcome!

While people are smart, the atmosphere is close-knit and not cutthroat, which I've come to realize is hugely important when I hear my friends at other top universities talk about the pressure and competition they suffer through. The academics aren't easy- especially the STEM programs, which are structured to be some of the most rigorous in the country, but that's why we have such a good reputation and ease with post-graduation placements. Compared to other colleges, there's a lot of freedom with social life/partying and distribution requirements. Overall, the campus is beautiful and quality of life (dorms/food/area) very high.

I've only been at Brown for one year, but I'm so glad I made the choice to come here when I was deciding between colleges last April.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2017-05-21T07:19:46.102135Z","guid":"2c103ebe-9493-4742-913d-b10ad951dcfb","rating":5},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":4.33}],"photos":{"default":{"author":"dlthurston","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/d1d76b930c48859e02f63f748a3945367e775298.jpg","MobileHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/ef12b3502047d88f9539208ca30d639cd9ed151d.jpg","Thumbnail":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/d0d1aee0c80f61350d0b6fbca66add980d876fd0"},"licenseName":"CC BY ","licenseUrl":"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/2.0/","sourceUrl":"https://www.flickr.com/photos/dlthurston/3967124267/"},"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-71.404467,41.827605,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-71.404467,41.827605,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.745997865528282,"count":937},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Providence, RI"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/brown-university/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"b6a1648c-7760-4bb0-a11f-fe8696c9c50b","badge":{"display":"Best Colleges for Computer Science in America","ordinal":13,"total":494,"vanityURL":"best-colleges-for-computer-science"},"content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"Columbia University","type":"College","url":"columbia-university"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.0683},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":22973},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"1410-1590"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Niche User","body":"I visited Columbia at the end of March with a group and loved the vibe of the campus.

The University can only continue to improve with that kind of input.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2018-05-20T16:55:44.706241Z","guid":"dddea4bf-6d90-443f-812d-ceb0e91f286c","rating":4},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":4.33}],"photos":{"default":{"crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/db874f98bb98e6e34adf46775253ffde676c803d.jpg","MobileHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/53174af6f3382dc22834849ba86fd5778e50263e.jpg"},"licenseName":"UNLICENSED"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.7078152753108347,"count":1126},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Chicago, IL"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/university-of-chicago/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"de47f4f1-92dd-4632-8a9f-986370be041a","badge":{"display":"Best Colleges for Computer Science in America","ordinal":20,"total":494,"vanityURL":"best-colleges-for-computer-science"},"content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"University of Michigan - Ann Arbor","type":"College","url":"university-of-michigan---ann-arbor"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.2859},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":16107},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"1310-1500"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Alum","body":"The University of Michigan's motto is \"Leaders and Best\" and that's exactly what this school provides and produces.
