Overall, this college is very good for anyone seeking a thorough education in their major with many opportunities to land a job where they desire.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2017-12-28T19:41:09.717732Z","guid":"d58376d2-05d8-46f4-9abe-7e861cb47aba","rating":4},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":3}],"photos":{"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-77.791057,42.258745,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-77.791057,42.258745,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.5403225806451615,"count":372},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Alfred, NY"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/suny-alfred-state-college/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"d955a136-6936-4e62-ba06-42c34956b4db","content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":true,"isPremium":false,"name":"Colorado State University - Pueblo","type":"College","url":"colorado-state-university---pueblo"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.9638},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":12887},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"870-1060"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Freshman","body":"I have met so many people and made a lot of new friends, including my roommate. These people weren't just people I sat next to in class, they come from so many different backgrounds, but we all shared the same ambitions. Each of my instructors try to get to know their students in not only a learning stance, but personally too. On that note I enjoyed each class of mine, and they all consisted of a decent amount of learners who for the most part, were all there to earn a higher education. Two things that I would like changed is the amount of attention that is needed between the Advisors and Financial Aid. They both are major aspects to my learning, but I found that they both don’t know anything about each other so there was a lot of back and forth between offices I had to do. But all together I have had some great experiences from CSU-P that I would never change, and I am happy to say I go to Colorado State University- Pueblo!","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2017-12-23T00:25:28.09519Z","guid":"da2ed516-601c-4fbe-b9eb-8f17648eb7a7","rating":4},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":2.66}],"photos":{"default":{"crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/c0998035ba0f9e574aaa0e21797a153c60b1bd3f.jpg","MobileHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/b39a9348f40ac50a6f7d3308eac23b2e3ff5b4e9.jpg"},"licenseName":"UNLICENSED"},"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-104.579846,38.309219,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-104.579846,38.309219,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.5217864923747277,"count":918},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Pueblo, CO"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/colorado-state-university---pueblo/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"516e33a8-95ea-4eda-904c-bacb50f7a9f3","content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":true,"isPremium":true,"name":"Florida Institute of Technology","type":"College","url":"florida-institute-of-technology"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.6133},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":31582},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"1060-1260"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Niche User","body":"FIT is a diverse school based right on the Florida Space Coast that offers a world-class education in a variety of STEM fields from Mechanical Engineering to the Biological Sciences.

AUM provide many opportunities to get involved on campus so that your voice can be heard. One of my favorite features that AUM is the learning resources.  They have many useful resources that can be used to get help outside of classes. If I had to change anything about Auburn University at Montgomery, I would change the food options and tuition fees. The food here is good, but also could be better.  As far as tuition, I think they should provide more scholarships for students who pay out of pocket. When choosing a college,   it is important to feel like you have made the best decision. At AUM, my decision, I believe hascollegbeen fulfilled. Overall, my experience at AUM has been non-complaint and decent. I am very excited to see where AUM take me in the near future!","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2018-04-30T21:05:39.579125Z","guid":"13b75947-7d59-4d3a-ae27-bd5fc0ee8ba5","rating":5},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":2.66}],"photos":{"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-86.177351,32.369939,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-86.177351,32.369939,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.567140600315956,"count":633},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Montgomery, AL"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/auburn-university---montgomery/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"c5cb784d-182a-49bc-8594-5ee15b80be90","content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"Clark Atlanta University","type":"College","url":"clark-atlanta-university"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.7184},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":27725},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"820-970"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Niche User","body":"I recently toured this college and absolutely loved it!

They are very considerate, and will be more than happy to help you in any way they can!","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2018-03-01T17:54:28.80516Z","guid":"c82bd938-dbc5-45ab-a646-c59aeaf083e6","rating":4},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":2.66}],"photos":{"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-93.060313,34.127792,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-93.060313,34.127792,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.4322033898305087,"count":708},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Arkadelphia, AR"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/henderson-state-university/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"03fe5f00-c275-4ce9-96b9-70dae13c88c9","content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":true,"isPremium":false,"name":"Utica College","type":"College","url":"utica-college"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.8195},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":24153},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"830-1050"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Graduate Student","body":"I have recently completed the MBA program at Utica College and I have had such an amazing and fulfilling experience!
