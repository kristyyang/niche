Just like the city of Miami, the school  is bubbling with a variety of different people with different backgrounds. The athletics teams at this school are great too, with our football team's ever-increasing ranking. We have had several celebrities come to the University of Miami, parading around campus, throwing up the \"U\" at sports games, and notably even filming a music video here! The University of Miami had everything I was looking for in a campus and choosing to go there it is one of the best decisions I've ever made.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2018-03-15T04:37:08.695438Z","guid":"74a18d4c-c9cc-4f0f-9d98-a0a8f17b2599","rating":5},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":4.33}],"photos":{"default":{"author":"chadcooperphotos","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/d499a5e27b3de6e0b67e9b70d0de6b3d28d91180.jpg","MobileHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/af7760f23fceb2fc19c4d7f1685a9a816e93f937.jpg","Thumbnail":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/ad3f68ac748ec758433b297c4cbdb275e3426664"},"licenseName":"CC BY ","licenseUrl":"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/2.0/","sourceUrl":"https://www.flickr.com/photos/chadcooperphotos/8541098302/in/album-72157632949229237/"},"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-80.27645,25.720406,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-80.27645,25.720406,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.782017378163959,"count":2647},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Coral Gables, FL"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/university-of-miami/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"d69617b0-6f48-4074-8122-362496298b21","content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"University of Nebraska at Omaha","type":"College","url":"university-of-nebraska-at-omaha"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.8648},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":11223},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"930-1210"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Sophomore","body":"UNO's location is perfect!

All around, it's my dream University.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2018-03-28T19:01:53.950799Z","guid":"053f6b46-001a-463c-918a-bb2b3715a877","rating":5},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":3.66}],"photos":{"default":{"author":"30791749@N07","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/fb90d2b3ad935c89ade7379fbae247b55fda1dd6.jpg","MobileHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/bcfdc0f48a7c27526977a21dfa677e69b4844f1c.jpg","Thumbnail":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/68d3568efbd5aaba40447846736fa48571b1d802"},"licenseName":"CC BY ","licenseUrl":"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/2.0/","sourceUrl":"https://www.flickr.com/photos/30791749@N07/11540284636/"},"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-97.361537,32.709568,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-97.361537,32.709568,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.85,"count":1460},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Fort Worth, TX"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/texas-christian-university/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"8ccaa673-b878-4654-a1cb-d11c55174936","content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"Northwestern University","type":"College","url":"northwestern-university"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.1066},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":29326},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"1400-1560"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Alum","body":"I attended Northwestern because of the music program and the professor I would be working with. My professor was amazing, and so was the music program as a whole. I was able to pursue a double major with an outside field, and while it was difficult and busy, the administration helped me every quarter by allowing me to take extra classes to finish on time. The campus is beautiful, but there is always construction. It is not a huge party school, but there are parties and lots of other ways to have fun. I loved the proximity to Chicago and the public transit system. Overall, I liked the student body. There was a general hard work ethic, and though my majors weren't particularly competitive, I know there were some that were fairly cut-throat. The mental health services can be improved upon, but I felt that NU was a very accepting, diverse, and progressive school overall.

Our school is known for its high recommendations for any science majors and math majors. I am a Zoology major and my best part of the university is the class where I go out of school with my class to field trip and identify different invertebrate animals near our shores. It was fun and a good leg work out too! Also, the local areas for food is quite amazing. When needing to eat besides campus food, there is a wide variety of different ethnic food here. What I like to see a change in Humboldt is to give a more housing chances for students that are from far away. More housing in the campus for everyone to be. It is tough to find an apartment or house near the school and have the housing costs to be low, for future students coming from different parts of California or an out of state transfer, they should have the opportunity to have a low-cost housing and a secure home to be in.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2018-06-04T07:47:55.941084Z","guid":"69c3f499-369e-44c2-b940-7c35a6e57796","rating":4},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":3}],"photos":{"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-124.0814,40.8741,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-124.0814,40.8741,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.5448863636363637,"count":1760},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Arcata, CA"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/humboldt-state-university/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"2beca607-a07e-40a3-b6ae-c23b64decb5d","content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"Harvard University","type":"College","url":"harvard-university"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.054},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":16205},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"1430-1600"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Alum","body":"Harvard University offers the most incredible experience for its students.

I cannot begin to tell you the opportunities available here nor what you will learn from working and studying alongside people from all over the world.

Because social -- and often intellectual -- life centers around student organizations, I've had the chance to meet people who share my passions. In lieu of Greek life, student organizations host parties that foster a sense of community that centers around something deeper than hazing or a few Greek letters. The professors are caring and encourage you to think for yourself. Another thing I want to emphasize is the effect of Jesuit values. I was hesitant about them coming in because I'm not religious, but Georgetown doesn't shove religion down your throat. Rather, the school makes a concerted and largely successful effort to instill Jesuit values into all aspects of the community, such as the values of empathy, care, and intellectual risk-taking.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2018-05-30T01:34:22.337211Z","guid":"978b0f5f-2601-433d-8a81-599a051a623f","rating":5},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":4.33}],"photos":{"default":{"author":"bootbearwdc","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/12abac16c83fda20334b5c577c5b4ec014e75704.jpg","MobileHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/120f5736f8423c08516a76bf1a3fd36cc3ebf457.jpg","Thumbnail":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/47a9f5b83376225e5d4b4f612ef47b38724d2850"},"licenseName":"CC BY ","licenseUrl":"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/2.0/","sourceUrl":"https://www.flickr.com/photos/bootbearwdc/57647301/"},"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-77.073463,38.908809,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-77.073463,38.908809,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.7115559599636034,"count":1099},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Washington, DC"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/georgetown-university/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"556c6afe-6763-4a0a-8194-b0eb4cac7519","content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"Lindenwood University","type":"College","url":"lindenwood-university"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.5469},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":22183},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"920-1130"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Junior","body":"I love Lindenwood because I have made an experience out of my time here.

Its campus is BEAUTIFUL; we have lush gardens and there are so many birds here, from towhees to even the occasional hawk. The opportunities here to get involved are almost overwhelming. We have this program called DukeEngage where students go to all parts of the world to work with communities through research and volunteer work. I will actually be going to Costa Rica this summer to help in rainforest restoratuon and conservation through this  program!But what I truly love most about this school is its students. The atmosphere here is not competitive but collaborative. I came to Duke feeling insecure about my qualifications compared to those of the other incoming freshman. But never once did I feel belittled or patronized. Students here want each other to succeed, we want to see each other grow and challenge ourselves to improve. Here at Duke, 'Southern Hospitality' is the real deal!","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2018-05-27T14:32:04.566007Z","guid":"8d7d7a19-d735-4b3a-bb8b-956045868832","rating":5},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":4.33}],"photos":{"default":{"crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/060a39c7091618b17ac4912d09653a075e5db302.jpg","MobileHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/221469f6158d96ba17f4d7425a31e5441d828291.jpg","Thumbnail":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/5566f81b753102ab38f93c2f1fc03d9386348966"},"licenseName":"UNLICENSED"},"mapbox_header":{"crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-78.94226,36.00159,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-78.94226,36.00159,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"UNLICENSED"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.827220077220077,"count":1036},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Durham, NC"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/duke-university/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"f81ccefb-aaf6-4ceb-be7a-7797d1698e57","content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"Brown University","type":"College","url":"brown-university"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.0931},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":25264},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"1370-1570"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Sophomore","body":"Brown University is an amazing place to go for undergrad. There's simply nowhere else that I'd rather spend four years learning and growing as a person. The open curriculum allows for lots of exploration and risk-taking in the classroom, and this culture bleeds into student life as well. The environment here is very relaxed and collaborative, and the students here are kind, accepting, and fun. And coming from a SoCal kid, the weather isn't even that bad! I've only been at Brown for one year, but I'm so glad I made the choice to come here when I was deciding between colleges last April.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2017-05-21T07:19:46.102135Z","guid":"2c103ebe-9493-4742-913d-b10ad951dcfb","rating":5},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":4.33}],"photos":{"default":{"author":"dlthurston","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/d1d76b930c48859e02f63f748a3945367e775298.jpg","MobileHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/ef12b3502047d88f9539208ca30d639cd9ed151d.jpg","Thumbnail":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/d0d1aee0c80f61350d0b6fbca66add980d876fd0"},"licenseName":"CC BY ","licenseUrl":"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/2.0/","sourceUrl":"https://www.flickr.com/photos/dlthurston/3967124267/"},"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-71.404467,41.827605,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-71.404467,41.827605,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.745997865528282,"count":937},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Providence, RI"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/brown-university/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"fbf152a7-a7f6-4afb-9fd7-143864f74928","content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"Tulane University","type":"College","url":"tulane-university"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.255},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":32515},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"1240-1410"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Freshman","body":"I love Tulane!

Additonally, many of the teachers and remainder of the faculty are friendly and supportive for all students to succeed.
