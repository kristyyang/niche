They also had a \"bar\" which consisted of virgin drinks. Rock the rec consisted of key logging, silent disco, glow in the dark dodgeball and rock climbing. We played capture the flag until 2am and last but not least, we had a huge rave paint party with an awesome DJ until close to midnight. \n\nClass wise, the classes aren't huge unlike UA or Auburn which is great for one on one time.

First off, the atmosphere at the University of North Alabama is unlike any other! Seeing as how the school is placed in a quaint little town like Florence, Alabama, everyone is so friendly and you feel right at home. Unlike bigger schools, UNA's professors are able to give students more one on one attention by offering smaller classes, and students feel free to engage more, thus building their success! There are many organizations on campus that adhere to everyone's interests. From being a dancer as a Lionette in the Pride of Dixie Marching Band, to joining the Student Public Relations organization, there are many opportunities for students to gain crucial experience that will build their resumes. I adore UNA, and wouldn't change a thing about it.

Ask questions, be honest and don't give up. College is tough but we are not alone, there will always be someone to help you along the way but we must make an effort and try. The number one rule in College is communication. From the experiences I've had in college you learn what it's like to become an adult it may soumd strange to say that but it's true.

The academic programs are cutting edge and highly regarded, like the computer science programs and the education programs. We are one of the few, if not the only, universities with a fully functioning laboratory school. This school is also very affordable for both in-state and out-of-state students, thanks to the Bearcat Advantage scholarship which covers the difference of in-state tuition for out-of-state students. Another great thing about this university is that laptops and textbooks are included in tuition. Aside from the academic and campus culture, the community culture is also amazing. This small town community provides you with warmth and comfort as everyone is treated like family. If you don't mind being in a relatively small and semi-rural town, I highly recommend Northwest because the environment is simply encouraging. Everyone here wants you to truly do your best.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2018-03-20T21:55:45.786594Z","guid":"49b76707-ff7c-4ec4-8dfc-8838f7eac8d9","rating":5},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":3.33}],"photos":{"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-94.884341,40.352706,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-94.884341,40.352706,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.6966966966966965,"count":999},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Maryville, MO"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/northwest-missouri-state-university/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"f98b224b-a6ba-4689-96ad-1ac05d172d46","content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"Northeastern State University","type":"College","url":"northeastern-state-university"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.9375},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":8365},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"873-1095"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Junior","body":"The advisors are extremely helpful, particularly in helping me transfer from  another University!

Shuttles that run every 20 minutes, so getting from main campus to downtown is not that hard. The problem is that sometimes drivers are late, they leave early, and some shuttles are too small to hold everyone. Security wise, there are emergency telephones around campus, and campus police drives around occasionally. I had a fantastic stay in the hotel-like freshman dorm, Clearview Hall. Too bad sleeping in the same room as your roommate is the only option. When I became a sophomore, I was upset with the rundown housing in Courtyard South/One. I will be moving to Courtyard North next semester and it is way better! I am not a big fan of the foods, but some days are better than others. The cafe is buffet style with a salad bar, pizza, hibachi, \"main event\", and desserts; they server different things for breakfast, lunch, and dinner.

Months wasted because of this.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2017-08-04T15:18:24.675345Z","guid":"32fe0c7e-8f4c-4012-88aa-7522da8ff774","rating":4},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":3}],"photos":{"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-90.068506,30.028539,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-90.068506,30.028539,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.542372881355932,"count":649},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"New Orleans, LA"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/university-of-new-orleans/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"25d74dcf-0b51-4f40-9510-cc1869e40b87","content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"Nicholls State University","type":"College","url":"nicholls-state-university"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.8266},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":10169},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"945-1134"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Senior","body":"Nicholls State Univeristy is a great univeristy if you’re looking for an amazing college experience. The teachers and administration provide the students with the tools necessary to succeed. The teachers know most of the students by name ( 20:1). My college experience has been fun. Nicholls provides over 100 clubs that you can join. If there’s not a club that you like, you can CREATE your own. (Bass fishing team, now ranked nationally) \nGreek life is very unique at Nicholls. The Greek students focus on being successful in the classroom and helping out the community. \nNicholls State University is definitely growing in popularity. The  Nicholls football team has had two great season (back-to-back) almost upsetting the Georgia Bulldogs(26-26) and losing to Texas A&M on a close battle game that A&M took in the 4th qtr.

Do you have a job/grad school lined up?\n\nParticipating in various events over the two years has helped me improve my presentation and event management skills. The call campaigns every semester which required calling students from 10-15 different countries helped me improve my customer service, sales and marketing skills. The team environment at the admissions office as well as the class room helped me learn how to work in a team environment. The College of Business has helped me become an international citizen.
