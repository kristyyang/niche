I personally love this class size because it allows me to create more meaningful and authentic relationships with my professor in a setting where I can have more one-on-one instruction if needed. With the encouragement and help of professors and my advisor on campus, I have been introduced to the opportunity to travel and teach in England for the summer.

Professors here really do care about your learning and success, and are always there if you need something. You do not feel like just another number at this school. Advisors also do their best to ensure your success, and are available for extra resources. Campus is also beautiful!

Some people do not feel comfortable at these big schools and can sometimes get overwhelmed by the number of students that attend here. It is easy to find a group of friends, but you should evaluate if you easily are overwhelmed and determine the importance of small classes. I was surprised at how much I liked the large classes, as I was always a class participator in class. The further you get in your major, the smaller the classes are which is always nice. In the past, whenever I told people I attended Penn State, the reaction was always a positive one. People always seemed to hold a high respect level for Penn State, which helped me build my sense of pride in my school.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2018-02-26T04:32:36.99796Z","guid":"3098f32d-d544-492c-840f-01acc6dff1d2","rating":5},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":3}],"photos":{"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-76.031567,40.984157,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-76.031567,40.984157,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.7340823970037453,"count":267},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Hazleton, PA"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/penn-state-hazleton/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"7dc03130-954f-43ac-a9e4-1b613ef63ebe","content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"Bloomsburg University of Pennsylvania","type":"College","url":"bloomsburg-university-of-pennsylvania"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.7756},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":16027},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"870-1070"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Sophomore","body":"Bloomsburg University of Pennsylvania is a great school.

It is in a small town that does not contain much so you'd have to go to Kingsport or Bristol to find the nice restaurants and shopping. We have some fast food and lots of hiking if you are into outdoor stuff. There are also lots of fun things to do on campus, and many trips that you can take with the student activities board!","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2018-02-19T06:25:05.087042Z","guid":"fae1f8ab-7dd7-4aeb-8638-fadd62245f03","rating":4},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":2.66}],"photos":{"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-82.558728,36.971468,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-82.558728,36.971468,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.427906976744186,"count":215},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Wise, VA"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/the-university-of-virginias-college-at-wise/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"8dc5069d-4c07-44bb-8a9c-87cf178842ad","content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"Friends University","type":"College","url":"friends-university"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.5501},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":19644},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"850-1010"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Freshman","body":"If a person wants to grow in their spiritual path and journey with God while achieving the highest academics imaginable then friends is outstanding! As a student athlete the hours for athletics and academics are very manageable and yield to very well rounded individuals. Friends offers a beautiful campus with the number one dorms in the state of Kansas. The facilities are up to date and are maintained fairly well. This tight knit university encompasses the community, faith, and family all in one small campus. Highly recommended!","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2017-03-23T02:04:18.910475Z","guid":"369b934b-2cbd-405a-bceb-3602c7590d7b","rating":5},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":3}],"photos":{"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-97.366666,37.678495,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-97.366666,37.678495,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.893536121673004,"count":263},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Wichita, KS"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/friends-university/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"8a8c50fd-2a3b-45ea-9e86-c0d7e60bf252","content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":true,"isPremium":true,"name":"Southern Utah University","type":"College","url":"southern-utah-university"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.7228},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":14024},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"890-1150"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Senior","body":"I love this school! I transferred from a different school and what a difference it's been. The professors really try to get to know you and they know your name by week two. They care very much about your education and you as a person. You can really connect with these professors. They make the lessons fun and interactive. The town is a great college town. There is so much to do outside here.
