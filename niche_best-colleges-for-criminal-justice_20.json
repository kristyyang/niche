Plus, it's right in downtown! I am part of a honor society for STEM majors and they provided the opportunity for me to do scientific research, and I am in my freshmen year! (also getting a stipend for it).  The university is also down the block from the world's largest medical center (hint hint pre-med and pre-nursing students)!  As for the social life, one can say that students do somewhat lack  is school spirit because it is a commute school so once students are done with classes, they leave.

First off, the atmosphere at the University of North Alabama is unlike any other! Seeing as how the school is placed in a quaint little town like Florence, Alabama, everyone is so friendly and you feel right at home. Unlike bigger schools, UNA's professors are able to give students more one on one attention by offering smaller classes, and students feel free to engage more, thus building their success! There are many organizations on campus that adhere to everyone's interests. From being a dancer as a Lionette in the Pride of Dixie Marching Band, to joining the Student Public Relations organization, there are many opportunities for students to gain crucial experience that will build their resumes. I adore UNA, and wouldn't change a thing about it.

The professors are helpful, some classmates become your friends, and your advisors become your motivation to push harder in your classes. Throughout the days, months, and years I've gone to college. People learn to become adults because they have to keep up with their assignments, they have to learn to communicate with others around them especially their professors. Ask questions, be honest and don't give up. College is tough but we are not alone, there will always be someone to help you along the way but we must make an effort and try. The number one rule in College is communication. From the experiences I've had in college you learn what it's like to become an adult it may soumd strange to say that but it's true. You are responsible for what happens next. I'll tell you one thing your tears, frustration, discouragement that you feel will eventually lead you to your strength and to your accomplishments in life.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2018-05-30T19:00:09.443743Z","guid":"37a6fa02-290b-4011-9a71-1674345449d3","rating":5},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":2.33}],"photos":{"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-97.882342,27.524852,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-97.882342,27.524852,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.479041916167665,"count":1002},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Kingsville, TX"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/texas-a-and-m-university---kingsville/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"f98b224b-a6ba-4689-96ad-1ac05d172d46","content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"Northeastern State University","type":"College","url":"northeastern-state-university"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.9375},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":8365},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"873-1095"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Junior","body":"The advisors are extremely helpful, particularly in helping me transfer from  another University!

Shuttles that run every 20 minutes, so getting from main campus to downtown is not that hard. The problem is that sometimes drivers are late, they leave early, and some shuttles are too small to hold everyone. Security wise, there are emergency telephones around campus, and campus police drives around occasionally. I had a fantastic stay in the hotel-like freshman dorm, Clearview Hall. Too bad sleeping in the same room as your roommate is the only option. When I became a sophomore, I was upset with the rundown housing in Courtyard South/One. I will be moving to Courtyard North next semester and it is way better! I am not a big fan of the foods, but some days are better than others. The cafe is buffet style with a salad bar, pizza, hibachi, \"main event\", and desserts; they server different things for breakfast, lunch, and dinner.

Overall,  if you are looking for a fun and yet academically focused school, Armstrong State is the place to be!","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2017-07-01T17:23:57.323617Z","guid":"409b391d-f087-4d0b-87c5-3274fcf5a3ea","rating":4},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":2.66}],"photos":{"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-81.160409,31.978109,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-81.160409,31.978109,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.545536519386835,"count":1109},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Savannah, GA"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/georgia-southern-university---armstrong/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"a13c42b0-586d-4007-9bde-0b82d4c8934e","content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":true,"isPremium":false,"name":"University of North Carolina at Pembroke","type":"College","url":"university-of-north-carolina-at-pembroke"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.7356},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":10566},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"840-1010"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Sophomore","body":"The experience at UNCP is phenomenal! There are numerous resources on campus and off campus for in-state and out of state students, to be successful. They help you in ALL categories that college students need help in such as, housing, job/money opportunities, tutoring, centers to help with assignments, food banks, plenty of fun activities, & shuttle buses for traveling off campus to local stores. Only thing I would like to see improved, to some point, is just more parking areas. Overall, this university is a well-rounded, filled with diversity & outstanding professors that actually help you.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2017-12-30T06:06:13.531219Z","guid":"042cb5a0-fa54-4e96-bfff-1313b9958c80","rating":5},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":2.33}],"photos":{"default":{"crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/8047b16335b962efd33fcc13695d1460bfb56e37.jpg","MobileHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/bc20a950eb330adbc6eba91c00ab9f6930bf6548.jpg"},"licenseName":"UNLICENSED"},"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-79.201895,34.687231,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-79.201895,34.687231,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.4536082474226806,"count":970},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Pembroke, NC"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/university-of-north-carolina-at-pembroke/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"9bb50435-ca9f-41e5-b2a1-01e53da77435","content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"Alabama A&M University","type":"College","url":"alabama-a-and-m-university"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.8738},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":15547},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"750-940"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Junior","body":"Alabama A&M University is the best HBCU in Alabama!
