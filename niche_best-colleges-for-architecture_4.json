I joined a sorority my first year and through that I have gained friends who encouraged me to get involved on campus in areas that I'm interested in and in organizations that they thought I would like. Because of the wonderful people at LaTech, I've been a member of leadership team at my church, the Student Government Association, Bulldogs for Life, AED PreMed Society, and many honor societies. The friends I've made here see the potential in me and push me to apply for leadership positions on campus. I'm pre-med and as I've gotten older, I've grown close to other students in my major and they are a HUGE support system for me because we share notes, advice, and prepare for things like interviews together. I can't think of much that I would change. I would like for the Pre-Med/Pre-Dent Advisory Committee interviews to be offered in the fall quarter instead of just once a year in the spring quarter.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2018-03-09T02:06:08.705378Z","guid":"8602bb74-934b-4133-9934-2dada4efdc51","rating":5},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":3.66}],"photos":{"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-92.64964,32.525518,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-92.64964,32.525518,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.6758241758241756,"count":910},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Ruston, LA"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/louisiana-tech-university/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"b212d30a-2d53-42db-b405-ed141a637592","content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":true,"isPremium":false,"name":"Arizona State University","type":"College","url":"arizona-state-university"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.825},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":13007},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"1020-1280"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Junior","body":"My experience at ASU was an experience like no other. My course and professors all inspired me to find my passion. I changed my major after the first semester; which allowed me to explore the different career paths before I chose my current career goal. ASU truly opened my eyes to a lot of wonderful opportunities. I am taking my experiences working alongside my peers in the school newspaper \"State Press\" and student outreach \"Programming and Activities Board\" to learn valuable work ethics for future career skills. As a medical studies major, I still find it important to surround myself with other activities and involvements that are not related to my major. Therefore, the school paper gives me sense of the journalism world and the PAB allows me to explore skills in marketing and event planning. Overall, my experience at ASU change my life and improved my skills that pertains to social, professional, and personal life skills.

But on the real— campus is absolutely beautiful, especially to a girl from flat Texas like me! Fayetteville is utterly charming, and has something for everyone. With thousands of international students and its central location, the diversity is special and so treasured on this campus. I am never worried about making friends of different backgrounds, or finding my niche with those who share my cultural background because it happens so naturally. There are also plenty of religious groups to get plugged into on and around campus. My only complaint is the Hill, but it is worth it to live in Pomfret Hall with bigger bathrooms, a nice common area, and the dining hall which comes in handy on days of inclement weather. I truly love being a Razorback, and am so grateful to call Northwest Arkansas my second home.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2017-12-31T08:20:55.505021Z","guid":"743e04d5-da12-4e79-b8a9-e1fbbec69371","rating":5},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":4}],"photos":{"default":{"author":"mtnorton","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/5469a0f272cd5651b2fcfac357f368e9aedfee1b.jpg","MobileHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/c40b369d23ffb3ef5ca2388827b771cfcb22ef59.jpg","Thumbnail":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/a2ba338f9c416b38ba6a2ee45506047d4f0176e7"},"licenseName":"CC BY ","licenseUrl":"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/2.0/","sourceUrl":"https://www.flickr.com/photos/mtnorton/7212584262/"},"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-94.178214,36.06153,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-94.178214,36.06153,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.787639710716634,"count":3042},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Fayetteville, AR"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/university-of-arkansas/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"4662e8d2-30af-481f-b32d-bde25f1108f8","content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":true,"isPremium":false,"name":"University of Texas - Arlington","type":"College","url":"university-of-texas---arlington"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.6982},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":11952},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"950-1190"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Sophomore","body":"I am a single mother of 2 girls (9&7) and I am finally finishing my degree in want I want to do.

To summarize, the University of Arizona is an amazing opportunity for anyone looking to get a world-class education in an environment where employers often come directly to you.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2018-03-01T03:25:26.123698Z","guid":"092f1096-7bb8-4ba8-852f-05209f1ef07f","rating":4},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":3.66}],"photos":{"default":{"author":"iagoarchangel","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/50d9d513c48381c6ba4939908c60bbd3ac3a4631.jpg","MobileHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/0c9c05adf4b9e9ce85277fdbe92468b57d06a2e7.jpg","Thumbnail":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/375760a6d8ec09f2b2b89cb9f9f2d14e6e577f2e"},"licenseName":"CC BY-SA","licenseUrl":"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/","sourceUrl":"https://www.flickr.com/photos/iagoarchangel/8608390310/"},"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-110.950769,32.232071,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-110.950769,32.232071,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.7181506849315067,"count":5840},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Tucson, AZ"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/university-of-arizona/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"fbbf2e6d-bad9-49b6-b8ac-4dfb5d3b10fc","content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"New York Institute of Technology","type":"College","url":"new-york-institute-of-technology"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.7255},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":23647},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"950-1180"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Freshman","body":"I have attended New York Institute of Technology for the past 6 months.

My favorite part of this university is all the learning opportunities it brings. In class, the learning style is so different from anything I had ever seen because we are taught to learn from other people's experiences and by engaging in conversations. Here, we aspire to be very politically and socially aware of different issues going around the world. There are organizations directed to many communities and they are really welcoming. Outside the classroom, those organizations could potentially become your family. The great thing about The New School is that it is very respectful of individuality. If you are a very \"on you own\" person that is respected but if you love being with people and socializing all the time you can find your space too. Also, the facilities are great and it is all located in the heart of New York City making it an amazing campus.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2018-04-04T23:31:36.327016Z","guid":"d81779b6-c8b7-413c-92b0-9fd0004f4d60","rating":5},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":3.66}],"photos":{"default":{"crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/20ff6502e17c54b03c03f44404216637012986ae.jpg","MobileHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/b73cd1410a49caf8011dcafe12dbd53f726eee3e.jpg"},"licenseName":"UNLICENSED"},"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-73.994636,40.735275,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-73.994636,40.735275,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.5483271375464684,"count":538},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"New York, NY"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/the-new-school/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"bdfbfaf3-f957-4b03-8c05-b600a3938e27","content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"Portland State University","type":"College","url":"portland-state-university"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.8942},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":14481},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"930-1160"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Freshman","body":"Portland State is a inviting environment in which one of the university's main goal is to have everyone feel accepted.

There’s a home for everyone at the University of Louisiana at Lafayette!","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2018-05-09T04:14:20.901973Z","guid":"1ded70e4-c554-4ec6-8bb2-7cac61331b2c","rating":4},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":3.66}],"photos":{"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-92.01941,30.215283,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-92.01941,30.215283,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.6619607843137256,"count":1275},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Lafayette, LA"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/university-of-louisiana---lafayette/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"c52d86cf-9ed3-461c-9aba-b7f10673c5cc","content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"University of North Texas","type":"College","url":"university-of-north-texas"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.7179},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":10424},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"980-1200"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Junior","body":"I have now attended UNT for almost 3 years now. What drew to the school was   its affordability, as well as, the diversity. The campus includes a broad range of students, but even though many are from different backgrounds, the campus has the ability of bringing everyone together. While living on campus, I have never felt more safe, safety is a top priority for the school and I am proud to call myself an eagle. The resources available on school are simply amazing, so you should never feel behind on anything course related. For the future, I am considering on continuing with a graduate academic career in the near future at UNT.

UIC is clearly diverse, but not inclusive. I have heard stories of qualified students of color being passed over for white students.\nThe are a plethora of scholarship opportunities to assist low-income and first generation students. I took out loans the first two years, but received a full-ride the last two years.\nAbout 90% of my profess were intellectually stimulating and very friendly. They welcome students during office hours and actually want to see you succeed. The advisors are the BEST! They are very supportive. The business career center is a great asset of UIC. The advisors help students find internships and full-time jobs after graduation.\nOverall, I would rate UIC a 8.2/10. They are definitely lacking in the social aspect and should coordinate more vibrant events.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2018-04-26T17:56:19.949051Z","guid":"98e81e06-7ce2-4632-a8e7-b9e4a199bc1d","rating":4},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":3.66}],"photos":{"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-87.651145,41.872651,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-87.651145,41.872651,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.5712780898876404,"count":2848},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Chicago, IL"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/university-of-illinois-at-chicago/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"114ecb3a-6ca2-470b-8221-65f1bf0dfbd9","content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"University of Nevada - Las Vegas","type":"College","url":"university-of-nevada---las-vegas"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.8278},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":11432},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"900-1130"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Junior","body":"I am about to start in my third year at UNIV and so far my experience in and outside of the classroom have been amazing! I live to be active in athletics and I fell in love with the intramural programs they offer including: Flag football, dodge ball and basketball. It allows for sociability and an overall increase in personal well-being. \nNot only did I enjoy my time in the gym,  but also in the classroom and on campus. Everyone I have come across on campus has been friendly. I think this is because we  all have a mutual understanding of respect and purpose in being privileged to attend this University. \nWith the diversity, growth and changes being implemented, I look forward to seeing my already great experience become even greater.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2018-05-18T21:21:05.206137Z","guid":"91836a75-ef94-4b84-a842-ff9d17e087d6","rating":5},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":3}],"photos":{"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-115.141153,36.106994,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-115.141153,36.106994,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.5882820784729588,"count":3772},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Las Vegas, NV"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/university-of-nevada---las-vegas/#scatterplot"}}]}
