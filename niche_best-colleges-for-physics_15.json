In the heart of Farmville, it's a nice scenic location with much to do outside of studying on campus, such as many state parks. The family and tradition one finds at Longwood is unmatched at other colleges.

The people are so friendly and collaborative, and the residential college system gives you an automatic support system and built-in friends/family. While people are smart, the atmosphere is close-knit and not cutthroat, which I've come to realize is hugely important when I hear my friends at other top universities talk about the pressure and competition they suffer through. The academics aren't easy- especially the STEM programs, which are structured to be some of the most rigorous in the country, but that's why we have such a good reputation and ease with post-graduation placements. Compared to other colleges, there's a lot of freedom with social life/partying and distribution requirements. Overall, the campus is beautiful and quality of life (dorms/food/area) very high.

Some downsides are the food (which isn't great) and some of the extra things that come with it being a small school. For example, registering for certain majors can be extremely difficult because of limited class options and there are less options for housing, food, and activities than on a larger campus.

The food here is good, but also could be better.  As far as tuition, I think they should provide more scholarships for students who pay out of pocket.

Basically, it's pretty cool.\n\nThe students are also pretty awesome. I never did anything with greek life and met my friends mostly through nerdy clubs (games club, anime, video games, etc), so my friend group is contrastingly diverse (though quite extensive) relative to the other reviewers.\n\nThe Comp Sci program (my area) here is also definitely growing, so I'm excited to see what happens. You could say I have no regrets!","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2018-01-21T16:06:46.138705Z","guid":"710ac511-1a21-4d45-a45b-51fb12d51661","rating":5},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":4.33}],"photos":{"default":{"author":"pong","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/9e162d4cb0c16141d2f1d69630e7180e0572a5d7.jpg","MobileHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/8f6662204500ae489fe0a410ffa26a762f599c11.jpg","Thumbnail":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/a8b1ddd79a6d0e3be00780f27f0a3986d118d1ac"},"licenseName":"CC BY ","licenseUrl":"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/2.0/","sourceUrl":"https://www.flickr.com/photos/pong/2387630265/"},"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-77.538702,37.577625,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-77.538702,37.577625,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.892597968069666,"count":689},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"University of Richmond, VA"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/university-of-richmond/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"cdc01707-8be3-4736-a753-0f82ad571a10","content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":true,"isPremium":false,"name":"Siena College","type":"College","url":"siena-college"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.7261},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":26816},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"1020-1220"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Freshman","body":"Best school ever. I have only spent one year at Siena so far, but I could not have imagined the transition from high school to college to have gone any smoother. The school itself is such a great size, with tons of incredible resources.

I felt very at home at Stetson, and greatly appreciate the time that I spent there.\nOver the past few years, there have been a few administrative decisions that have been questionable, such as unusual aesthetic additions and a large enrollment increase without sufficient housing opportunities.
