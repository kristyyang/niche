The academic programs are wonderful and the teachers want to see  you succeed. There are many ob opportunities available on campus. Since this is a Christian school, most of the events and functions reflect that. The students themselves are not very diverse. The school allows for students to have clubs for the different ethnicities and nationalities on campus. There is no Greek life or big party scene on campus. Most people go home on the weekends or just enjoy trips out of town. I like staying on campus sometimes for the weekends because buildings aren't crowded and everything is really quiet and serene.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2018-05-25T22:52:05.259438Z","guid":"6470abad-8976-4557-a907-82494553f4d7","rating":4},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":3}],"photos":{"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-97.463479,31.066798,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-97.463479,31.066798,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.82521186440678,"count":944},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Belton, TX"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/university-of-mary-hardin-baylor/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"414813f0-dfa1-4600-857e-b2bc99c8098a","content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"La Roche College","type":"College","url":"la-roche-college"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.9227},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":22426},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"810-1020"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Junior","body":"La Roche may seem like a tiny dot on a map to some, but La Roche college has so many things to offer to students and I am proud to be a part of it! The school has many clubs for students to join which range from doing many different things. One great thing that La Roche offers to students which other schools don't is the chance to study abroad. What is special about the study abroad opportunities at La Roche doesn't have you pay extra money for the trip. When paying for tuition, study abroad is included in that which makes it impossible to pass up!","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2018-05-24T01:29:15.82515Z","guid":"70d29b9c-2cc7-415a-960f-ce1f9d45b087","rating":5},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":2.66}],"photos":{"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-80.011977,40.569777,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-80.011977,40.569777,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.3763440860215055,"count":279},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Pittsburgh, PA"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/la-roche-college/#scatterplot"}}]}
