The staff is friendly and professional and always willing to help or find the appropriate office/staff to assist.  The food can be really good but not always.  There are so many activities to be involved in even if your not an athlete!  Overall the town of Fayette is small with few eating, off campus activities but it is centrally located so it is just a short drive to the mall, etc.  Tuition is about 30K per year a little high but they work with students to find scholarships, grants, etc to help lower the cost.  The dorms are old and some outdated but there is construction on campus to update facilities.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2018-04-17T13:20:42.251087Z","guid":"a668d097-dc5f-461e-82fa-c1f9b0807255","rating":4},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":2.66}],"photos":{"default":{"crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/b18305fd0efb3ed01a43a36ad3c31d23e97634a6.jpg","MobileHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/bbd627a06d300c5a261df0b0eca717bcb0765392.jpg"},"licenseName":"UNLICENSED"},"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-92.685,39.1481,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-92.685,39.1481,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.5223880597014925,"count":268},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Fayette, MO"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/central-methodist-university/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"8b779ae4-27a4-4065-a4b5-6af92123bb2e","content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"Southern Connecticut State University","type":"College","url":"southern-connecticut-state-university"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.6352},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":14960},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"830-1030"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Freshman","body":"I have only completed one semester, but within this term I have experienced the enthusiasm that other students and faculty have for this college.

I find that CSULA is very safety-conscious, maintains an excellent campus environment and student life, and hires very impressive and motivated professors who instill knowledge and their own passions into the students they teach. However, if there are two aspects that I would like to see CSULA improve on, they would be the local area and campus food. I would appreciate it if there were interesting activities to participate in in the local area and if there was a much bigger variety of healthy food choices aside from the food trucks and the food court.

When I visited campus for the first time, I knew this was the college I was going to be deciding on. The size of campus is perfect for a student who has always been in a small high school. Campus is very much together; you could walk to all of your classes. There's a shuttle bus that runs every 15-20 minutes that will take you around campus when you're feeling lazy or the weather is bad. The faculty members I've experienced the past 3 years I've been there have been AMAZING. I've met the most knowledgeable individuals at the Psychology Department. They are my favorite and most loved department at ESU! The dorms and housing are constantly improving which makes it hard to pick a hall to live in.

It's not perfect, but no college is. However, being a freshman, my transition from high school to college has been great. Most professors are super helpful and really like to challenge you. Campus safety is a goal that Rhode Island College strives to make their students feel. There is always RIC security driving through campus and many emergency push buttons all over. Which makes you feel very safe. The campus is small and beautiful and gives a home feeling like no other college I looked into. I am a commuter so I can not say what it is like living on campus. However the one downfall the college has is not enough parking spaces...Like ever. The school is mostly a commuter school which is cool, but parking can be horrendous depending on the time you have classes. Even with that one downfall RIC is an amazing school and I absolutely recommend looking into it!","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2016-11-22T23:55:17.202119Z","guid":"05a61093-ff03-43d9-ac63-7124842d7d3a","rating":5},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":2.66}],"photos":{"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-71.466915,41.84266,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-71.466915,41.84266,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.390829694323144,"count":916},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Providence, RI"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/rhode-island-college/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"08e4512d-1b69-4961-b165-881c7fb2b953","content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":true,"isPremium":false,"name":"Indiana University of Pennsylvania","type":"College","url":"indiana-university-of-pennsylvania"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.9154},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":17264},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"840-1050"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Graduate Student","body":"The Indiana University of Pennsylvania (IUP) is a wonderful institution for higher education.

This is a small friendly West Texas Christian University in an extremely nice larger West Texas University town.  It is less diverse than people there understand but the Religious Denomination that runs the school works at being \"Color blind.\"  This school is likely torture for a North Eastern Liberal Black Lesbian!  And likely \"Heaven\" for a Shy Conservative not too over-achieving black or white straight kid.  The Social life is the Religious life or you're going to Texas Tech for parties.  This school started in the 1950's & strictly follows it's founding Religious principles...kindly.  This is about where George Bush had his wild drunken party days.
