The people here are awesome. If you want a place where you can walk across campus and know 10 out of the 20 people that you just walked past, this is the place for you. The professors care about you and your education, and about what you are doing as a student to further your experience in the classroom. Campus is small, and the closest 'big town' is about ten minutes away, but you can always find things to do and people to do them with if you try hard enough. If you don't think a big school is for you, then SAU might be a good option! Our CORE program does a really good job of getting new students hooked up with a student mentor and a group of fellow classmates from the first day on campus. You get to grow with this group and you might find that some of those people will be your good friends.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2017-01-23T21:51:30.56762Z","guid":"7da6c56d-c755-40aa-ab52-6dfe796b878f","rating":4},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":2.66}],"photos":{"default":{"crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/cfbd055fdf88698a3021c1fb1c275238f3a3cd8d.jpg","MobileHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/04ce8326585f3ef8285079f8ba1d89d66e5fc71f.jpg"},"licenseName":"UNLICENSED"},"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-84.551918,42.206233,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-84.551918,42.206233,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.6422764227642275,"count":738},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Spring Arbor, MI"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/spring-arbor-university/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"c45e7144-d7cd-4ee0-a779-641ea23d6215","content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":true,"isPremium":true,"name":"Southwestern Assemblies of God University","type":"College","url":"southwestern-assemblies-of-god-university"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.2347},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":25466},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"800-1030"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Senior","body":"Southwestern Assemblies of God University is the type of place where you just feel right at home and welcomed as soon as you arrive.

Upon reading this, you may seem a bit skeptical seeing as how its an \"Assemblies of God\" campus which in your mind is summed up as \"reserved, strict, and overall an anti-'good time' living.\" However, although the University are somewhat strict and frowns upon most cases of going out partying and drinking and has a curfew during the academic year, the atmosphere on each of the halls I wouldn't describe as anything less than family-like. Living on a small campus may seem to some as a disadvantage, but it enables you to become familiar with almost everyone on the campus which can have several benefits.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2017-08-13T23:14:44.135853Z","guid":"c23abd0c-7514-4861-aa73-4c8c0ccf947e","rating":4},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":3}],"photos":{"default":{"crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/3450c186f2426028217f0b432a634602c173e950.jpg","MobileHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/56c01a9ba1a806b7680647697b1d21f332479944.jpg"},"licenseName":"UNLICENSED"},"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-96.85315,32.405477,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-96.85315,32.405477,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.9687092568448503,"count":767},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Waxahachie, TX"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/southwestern-assemblies-of-god-university/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"0c1bbdd2-6245-43ce-bb41-aa3e3273feb7","content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"Texas Wesleyan University","type":"College","url":"texas-wesleyan-university"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.4116},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":19804},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"925-1070"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Junior","body":"Texas Wesleyan is an outstanding private University!

They have a variety of clubs and organizations that help and assist students involve themselves in activities and internships!  Our staff members involve themselves as much as possible in order for students to find their right major. We are a big family , regardless of how small we are. Also, I will never get tired of saying this... Everyone is nice. Texas Wesleyan is a diverse, fun and successful University.

Its a close knit school and very friendly csmpus. Academics are very good with small class sizes.  My daughter, who is African American, has made friends of all sorts and is involved in a lot. Sure, it does not have the big school sports scene but the college was top ranked in division two in severals sports. Security seems tight so far and there's a real emphasis on community service. If you want a school where the student will not get lost in a crowd and will get a very good foundation, Rockhurst is an under the radar gem with well respected academics as with most Jesuit colleges. Its not a commuter school even though its in an urban area.

While i dont live on campus, there are many activities and events that you can attend, as well as organizations. I love Siena, as i am double majoring in Early Education and Child Development. As a double major, communicating with the teachers and advisors is a key part to it. Overall, I feel that Siena is the best choice for me, and have had great experiences with all teachers. While on campus, many of the staff members will get to know you by name, not as a number. To me, it is really important to recognize students and call them by name, as it makes you feel important. There is always a Campus Safety Guard around for emergencies, and they are very quick responders.

It's a great campus and a supportive community, for the most part. Majority of the buildings on campus are very old, but it seems as though some of the housing buildings are the only true indication of the campus' age. Overall the campus is a safe place, but I would like to see better management of the school's more personal cases (such as Title IX cases) and how they protect the survivors after the dust settles. I would also like to suggest starting incoming freshmen out with advisors in their fields of study, if a major has been decided upon. It would make figuring out the requirements for their majors less confusing, than to be switched around so often and risking being able to graduate on time due to lack of credits required.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2018-05-31T19:15:46.749877Z","guid":"24c0b829-00b2-4318-a915-34137ffea789","rating":4},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":2}],"photos":{"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-80.020864,36.926648,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-80.020864,36.926648,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.3839285714285716,"count":336},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Ferrum, VA"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/ferrum-college/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"348ffb9b-df94-4eab-9fc7-46478c965b17","content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"Mars Hill University","type":"College","url":"mars-hill-university"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.5674},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":17170},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"840-1040"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Junior","body":"Personally I love mars Hill.
