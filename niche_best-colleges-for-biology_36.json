One of the biggest things that I think Cabrini needs to change is the size of the campus. Yes I understand that it is easier said than done.

The professors are friendly and helpful.  There are an abundant amount of resources on campus, as well as, many places to get food.  There are a lot of things to keep a student busy on campus.  The gym is a great place to burn energy; there is even a pool, hot tub, and sauna!  California University even has a movie theater that shows all the latest movies, not to mention the great popcorn!","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2018-01-30T01:47:38.108637Z","guid":"04e7f390-e86c-467f-917e-4b12be55989b","rating":5},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":2.33}],"photos":{"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-79.884477,40.066473,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-79.884477,40.066473,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.3453453453453452,"count":1332},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"California, PA"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/california-university-of-pennsylvania/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"d78fac94-90d1-4be7-9adb-85d2dc2c7e21","content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"Medaille College","type":"College","url":"medaille-college"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.6923},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":14205},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"780-990"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Senior","body":"I loved the fact that the class sizes were small.

Busy college town, nice food, nightlife, neat places.The professors are helpful and engaging and actually want you to succeed. Class sizes are small which adds to the quality of education. Cafeteria food is okay, but not great. The campus is quite small so it's easy to get from building to building, and you'll become familiar with nearly every face you meet. If you're looking for a college where everyone's pleasant and generally minds their own business, and has sports and study places and little clubs for everyone, this is it. The campus looks welcoming and feels safe. There are always several nighttime security on duty, and a quick phone call will get you a ride to your car or dorm any time.I attended as a post secondary high school student, and was accepted and fit quite comfortably in among the students, easy pace and class sizes. I likely will be attending Bethany for my college career and recommend it.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2016-10-27T05:27:39.129799Z","guid":"98aca6e3-1d50-47c7-9466-2acb1eab2425","rating":4},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":3}],"photos":{"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-93.990744,44.166485,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-93.990744,44.166485,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.6417910447761193,"count":201},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Mankato, MN"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/bethany-lutheran-college/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"aa9ab826-7609-4f37-8dc3-6d50f44688de","content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":true,"isPremium":false,"name":"Kettering College","type":"College","url":"kettering-college"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.9921},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":20057},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"950-1210"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Junior","body":"Kettering offers smaller classroom sizes and it gives you that enables you to get to know your classmates. It also help with your learning experience as teachers are better able to give you individual attention. The lectures always make themselves available outside office hours. Additionally, they do everything in their power to ensure that you understand the information and succeed.

I selected this school because (a) I grew up in Christian Science and like the religion, and (b) I am NOT into partying. At all. Some people party here (quietly), but most do not. I'm currently a Sophomore and love it here. I play on the soccer team and have two different jobs, and keep very busy. I didn't think I'd attend a college with only 500 students, since my high school had 1200 students, but I feel very comfortable here. Sometimes it gets  super-quiet here on weekends, but I've always been able to find someone to hang out with.
