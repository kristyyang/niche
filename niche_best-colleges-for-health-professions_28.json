From the beginning of my relationship with AU, I have felt special and valued. The Admissions Department is superb - campus visits run smoothly, student ambassadors are friendly and helpful, Admissions Counselors are great and ready to answer any and every question. Campus life is great - first year residences are not too different from any other university BUT the free laundry is a major bonus! Also, free mini fridge/microwave units are available in every room. Printing services are more than adequate - 500 free pages per year (I only used about 200 this year!). Dining services are adequate and they're always looking to improve. Professors are superb - open door policy makes visiting offices much more inviting and professors are so accessible. Classes are informative, relevant, and challenging. Professors will work with you in any way to help you understand information and better yourself as a student.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2017-05-30T20:17:16.312907Z","guid":"e5fd8217-d842-49e2-925d-31e4d3fb8067","rating":5},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":4}],"photos":{"default":{"crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/26b4893272f51e5d291d182138739f8efee4f49f.jpg","MobileHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/210e95dc27dd5bc3c2747890c9feba4ecb98fc85.jpg"},"licenseName":"UNLICENSED"},"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-96.738507,43.525939,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-96.738507,43.525939,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.7058823529411766,"count":391},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Sioux Falls, SD"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/augustana-university/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"fc2c6888-3641-4b6f-a1cf-8f3e7cf5811d","content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"Becker College","type":"College","url":"becker-college"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.6534},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":30485},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"920-1130"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Freshman","body":"I am a freshman, but I've been on campus a few times these past months.

While i dont live on campus, there are many activities and events that you can attend, as well as organizations. I love Siena, as i am double majoring in Early Education and Child Development. As a double major, communicating with the teachers and advisors is a key part to it. Overall, I feel that Siena is the best choice for me, and have had great experiences with all teachers. While on campus, many of the staff members will get to know you by name, not as a number. To me, it is really important to recognize students and call them by name, as it makes you feel important. There is always a Campus Safety Guard around for emergencies, and they are very quick responders. The campus is well diverse, but all students are welcoming and accepting of each other.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2018-04-27T01:09:36.640892Z","guid":"f5eb111c-ee6c-47f4-b1bf-ef96ce0c7c89","rating":4},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":2.66}],"photos":{"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-84.015144,41.905952,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-84.015144,41.905952,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.4545454545454546,"count":440},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Adrian, MI"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/siena-heights-university/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"727f8d62-8aae-48e7-91a8-7a28a9dd3b04","content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"Dakota State University","type":"College","url":"dakota-state-university"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.8263},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":15375},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"860-1165"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Freshman","body":"This college is most famous for it's Cyber Security degree.

This is one of the most technologically integrated universities. The professors are really friendly and among the best at what they do. There are a lots of major to choose from. The environment is quiet,friendly and secure but there is not a lot to do around campus.If you're someone who's used to partying a lot and hoping to enjoy college life as they show in the movies, then you might wanna consider other options.  The food is fresh and healthy but it's almost the same thing everyday and not so tasty.

It's a great campus and a supportive community, for the most part. Majority of the buildings on campus are very old, but it seems as though some of the housing buildings are the only true indication of the campus' age. Overall the campus is a safe place, but I would like to see better management of the school's more personal cases (such as Title IX cases) and how they protect the survivors after the dust settles. I would also like to suggest starting incoming freshmen out with advisors in their fields of study, if a major has been decided upon. It would make figuring out the requirements for their majors less confusing, than to be switched around so often and risking being able to graduate on time due to lack of credits required.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2018-05-31T19:15:46.749877Z","guid":"24c0b829-00b2-4318-a915-34137ffea789","rating":4},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":2}],"photos":{"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-80.020864,36.926648,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-80.020864,36.926648,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.3839285714285716,"count":336},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Ferrum, VA"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/ferrum-college/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"348ffb9b-df94-4eab-9fc7-46478c965b17","content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"Mars Hill University","type":"College","url":"mars-hill-university"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.5674},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":17170},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"840-1040"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Junior","body":"Personally I love mars Hill.

It was also nice that there were only two buildings where classes were held so I never had to worry about getting lost when I was a freshman.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2018-02-07T03:00:07.114041Z","guid":"003f6b1c-aeda-401b-be69-ec2d4622a89f","rating":4},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":2.33}],"photos":{"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-78.856569,42.92895,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-78.856569,42.92895,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.60857908847185,"count":373},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Buffalo, NY"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/medaille-college/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"ae0a31d3-30b9-430e-89d6-a6014384114d","content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"Our Lady of the Lake University","type":"College","url":"our-lady-of-the-lake-university"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.5473},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":18754},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"830-1010"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Junior","body":"Such a wonderful school!
