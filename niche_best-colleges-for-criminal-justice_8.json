During this time, I acquired my Bachelor of Arts in Social Work while receiving a  minor in Psychological Science. One thing I noticed while enrolled at the university is that the teachers were very proactive in ensuring the best learning environment for their students. I found that the professors made themselves available to students who needed extra time outside of classroom time to process materials being taught in class. As a young African American Woman, I was further impressed by not only the diversity of the university's  faculty but also their students. Overall, my experience at CCSU was positive. The only thing I would change is for the university to be as considerate to traditional students as they are to non-traditional students as it relates to class availablity.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2018-02-02T15:20:29.113994Z","guid":"ec08d80e-79bf-40e3-b696-0782ce36de86","rating":4},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":2.66}],"photos":{"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-72.770094,41.690258,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-72.770094,41.690258,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.3884156729131174,"count":1174},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"New Britain, CT"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/central-connecticut-state-university/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"d20f3736-fc88-4774-804c-6bc1a9e51c23","badge":{"display":"Best Colleges for Criminal Justice in America","ordinal":186,"total":484,"vanityURL":"best-colleges-for-criminal-justice"},"content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"St. Joseph's College - New York","type":"College","url":"st-josephs-college---new-york"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.6678},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":16831},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"900-1110"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Alum","body":"Loved the family feel of the school.

Their graduation rate is 98%, so there is excellent academic programs. I'm personally in the nursing program, both in the BSN and ADN. No other school would let me do both. I'm doing both to allow me to get a year of work experience before graduate school. GW encourages their students to further their education to graduate school. Additionally, GW has huge diversity within the campus. We have many students who live across the world just to come here, a lot of them for sports. Another benefit about going to GW is the security/safety. We have an actual police department on campus that consists of about eight to nine officers on call. Overall GW is one of the best colleges to go to whether you are looking to play sports, all about academics, a safe place away from home, or looking for a new environment!","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2018-03-20T14:56:54.553908Z","guid":"27c35606-55e5-4447-951e-ffe981e71af3","rating":5},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":2.66}],"photos":{"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-81.668141,35.24732,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-81.668141,35.24732,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.604685212298682,"count":683},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Boiling Springs, NC"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/gardner-webb-university/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"7d6ee71f-baa4-41c3-91c7-b95a569cefcd","badge":{"display":"Best Colleges for Criminal Justice in America","ordinal":188,"total":484,"vanityURL":"best-colleges-for-criminal-justice"},"content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":true,"isPremium":false,"name":"Mississippi State University","type":"College","url":"mississippi-state-university"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.5567},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":15628},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"960-1260"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Junior","body":"Mississippi State University is such a wonderful college choice, for so many reasons.

I will forever be a huge proponent for MSU, and everything that it has have to offer. MSU has offered me so much just in the two semesters I have been here. I am majoring in Kinesiology, and every single of one the professors in this department are so helpful, and truly want to watch each student succeed. The professors in this department are particularly wonderful in assisting their students to get into grad school.

Everyone I have met so far has been very nice and you make new friends everyday.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2018-03-01T21:23:51.063271Z","guid":"d78ccd1d-8358-449e-898d-91402876ae4b","rating":4},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":3}],"photos":{"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-94.58546,31.58562,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-94.58546,31.58562,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.6658364466583646,"count":2409},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Nacogdoches, TX"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/stephen-f-austin-state-university/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"315dfb5e-8e64-4fc5-bc46-307051537d5a","badge":{"display":"Best Colleges for Criminal Justice in America","ordinal":200,"total":484,"vanityURL":"best-colleges-for-criminal-justice"},"content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"Marywood University","type":"College","url":"marywood-university"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.6832},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":23609},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"940-1120"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Freshman","body":"I love Marywood because of how personal my experience was.

If you like to party, youll love Cortland even more. There is always a reason to go out and drink with your friends and the bar scene is legit. If youre not a partier, thats cool too, there is always SO much going on campus youre sure to have fun without drinking. The city itself is a neat, they recently received a 10 million dollar grant to renovate downtown. Huge economy boost. Syracuse's Destiny mall is a half hour away and SUNY Cortland sponsors trips to go there so if you or your friends dont have a car, you’re good.

They welcome students during office hours and actually want to see you succeed. The advisors are the BEST! They are very supportive. The business career center is a great asset of UIC.

The other students and members of the Mount community including coaches, priests, seminarians, and alumni are very involved in the school and try to make the students feel a part of a larger community. I have enjoyed each moment at the Mount because it has become my home away from home! Seriously, I call it home even when I am away from it! If I had to go through the college selection process again, I would still choose the Mount.

The campus is real beautiful; coming from LA, I've never seen so many trees in one spot. The professors I've had have been great and I've taken away valuable information from their classes and applied that information to my everyday life. One thing I do wish was different would be the amount of students that are accepted. With so many students here, it's very difficult to get into the classes necessary to graduate. There are a lot of impacted majors, but that is because the programs Sac State offers have to be some of the best in the country; so, it's understandable. Other than that, Sac State is a very great school. Everyone here, including the staff, is very friendly and willing to help others out when they're lost or have any questions about anything.

It is such a relaxing environment and you never get bored of looking at that view. Quinnipiac was a very convenient choice for me because I was planning on being a commuter and the campus is close to home. In my second year here, I can say with certainty that everyone here is so friendly and always willing to help you. The professors are amazing and they will do everything they can to make sure you are understanding the concepts and succeeding academically. Another interesting thing about Quinnipiac is that it has many clubs and organizations available. In this way, each student can definitely find something that matches their hobbies and interests. And lastly, I am glad I chose Quinnipiac because it offers such an interesting major, which is Behavioral Neuroscience. I recently declared it and I can't wait to explore it further more in the months to come!","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2017-10-02T17:40:43.034339Z","guid":"3bd64d3d-094c-49df-942d-ca0a22242104","rating":5},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":3.33}],"photos":{"default":{"crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/c961c711b4b64bfd61847d72217c707792e082b6.jpg","MobileHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/0aeb2577dea0abc6367c8101d8e600c38c3a97f5.jpg"},"licenseName":"UNLICENSED"},"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-72.895542,41.419527,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-72.895542,41.419527,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.507514450867052,"count":1730},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Hamden, CT"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/quinnipiac-university/#scatterplot"}}]}
