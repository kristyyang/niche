HPU became part of our life. My son #2 knew that weekend that HPU was on his short list. After being accepted to more prestigious schools, he decided, despite a lot of pressure from family and friends, to take a leap of faith and go to HPU.  He entered in the Fall of 2016 into the honors program. The opportunities he's had thus far have been amazing. HPU delivers on everything and more. In addition, my son #1 decided to transfer to HPU in the Fall of 2016 as well. Two brothers, same school, very different experiences and both having an extraordinary education and experience.\nI read everything on the internet about HPU, much good, some not so good. I was so nervous about whether or not we had made a good decision.  I couldn't be more pleased with HPU and proud that my boys are part of such a warm, loving college community. So...HPU, plan on seeing son #3 in the Fall of 2018!","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2017-04-18T02:34:35.781478Z","guid":"443cf35f-62e7-4d7a-b4b1-b2ed45d6aff9","rating":5},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":3}],"photos":{"default":{"crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/85a927751fee670ec13e8b2bd6635a741d248509.jpg","MobileHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/400c79a2862bc9181d50e3a7f7cfd298f155794c.jpg"},"licenseName":"UNLICENSED"},"mapbox_header":{"crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-79.994545,35.972674,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-79.994545,35.972674,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"UNLICENSED"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.7,"count":1350},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"High Point, NC"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/high-point-university/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"5decf1a0-11be-4c8a-8473-18044525e897","content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"University of Hartford","type":"College","url":"university-of-hartford"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.7193},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":30233},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"920-1160"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Sophomore","body":"Overall, I enjoy my time at University of Hartford and feel that it's worthwhile to attend the school.

Extremely strict rules and regulations where violation for missed class or other minor offense may result in 5 hours punishment usually conducted in a physical manner such as marching.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2018-04-30T04:20:17.92536Z","guid":"6f6ba94d-f985-405c-9e2f-8f3764a7ccd3","rating":4},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":4}],"photos":{"default":{"crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/51e986c81df748188b50ed870393ebecffc7cbb6.jpg","MobileHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/3b21d23561fa817efb6037499fa79c553901ddf5.jpg"},"licenseName":"UNLICENSED"},"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-73.956804,41.390882,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-73.956804,41.390882,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.349090909090909,"count":275},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"West Point, NY"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/united-states-military-academy-at-west-point/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"33bc01be-a427-4f20-af0c-162553a2902f","content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"Alabama State University","type":"College","url":"alabama-state-university"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.459},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":12796},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"730-920"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Junior","body":"My experience here at Alabama State University has been very positive, also the school is very helpful and always helping others when their needs are available.

The campus is a very inviting environment; there are always events going on whether it is sports, diversity, or arts. The professors give off a warm, caring  aroma. No student should be afraid to ask for help from their professor; they are always willing whether it is through office hours or email. MSUM offers many ways to help students succeed; from tutoring to the Wellness Center for physical health. The campus is just the right size, not too small yet not overwhelming as well. As soon as I visited MSUM my senior year of high school, I knew it was home. Though, what I would like to see change is the exclusion from some activities held on campus. For example, they have activities that exclude some students from clubs or learning communities. I wish for more equality in allowing all students to be involved.

I really like this school, but as a local, I can tell you that Fredonia itself is a pretty boring town, however I've noticed that many students from NYC appreciate that.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2018-01-20T08:04:05.042899Z","guid":"dd3407fb-96bb-4744-9704-16e57139c800","rating":4},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":3}],"photos":{"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-79.336109,42.450961,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-79.336109,42.450961,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.5501379944802207,"count":1087},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Fredonia, NY"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/suny-fredonia/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"96157503-b967-490a-ad5e-c0d0d18b2dc1","content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":true,"isPremium":false,"name":"University of Nebraska at Kearney","type":"College","url":"university-of-nebraska-at-kearney"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.8508},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":15520},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"830-1020"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Freshman","body":"My experience at the University of Nebraska at Kearney has been very good.

It is a great school academically and provides all of the opportunities a student could want in terms of good professors, real life experience and a supportive culture. Looking at the social aspect of the school, Butler has a very-tight knit group of student that share similar values (\"The Butler Way\"). Also, it is great to be so close to Broad Ripple and Downtown as this is obviously a big advantage both professionally and socially. Diversity on campus is not great, but I do think it is getting better. All in all, I would 100% recommend Butler if you are still deciding.
