It certainly is a big party school. Im sure there are other colleges that have bigger parties, but I think what makes Tulane such a party school is the frequency of going out. Typically people go out tuesday-saturday and most people come here knowing its a big party school, so everyone is always down to go out. Also greek life is pretty big here too.

I also enjoy how incoming freshman are able o have cars on campus, it's a big help to be able to get home more often. There are a few things that Northern Michigan University could improve on. The parking situation is one of them, although they have added multiple lots to help the problem. Another item that could be better is the dining areas.

If one can look past the isolated feeling at times, it is a great place to learn and make life long friends.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2018-02-26T04:03:01.217363Z","guid":"db1b03f2-bb49-43cc-93c5-a1f2051a3f7b","rating":4},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":3}],"photos":{"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-95.906913,33.243814,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-95.906913,33.243814,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.6611909650924024,"count":974},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Commerce, TX"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/texas-a-and-m-university---commerce/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"709c9868-25cf-40d4-b94e-b2420a0dbbc6","content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"Morehead State University","type":"College","url":"morehead-state-university"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.8556},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":11296},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"840-1060"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Freshman","body":"I really do love this college but there are some downfalls to the way things work. They have a tutoring center but sometimes even the tutors aren't sure how to help you and that can be really frustrating. I live in a form and I have to say, there are some RAs who seem to be a little too into your personal life and it doesn't always feel like there's much privacy. I am unable to go home on weekends so I have spent time looking for things to do on and around campus but there really isn't much to ever do. The problem I have with the food is sometimes you find hair, my hair is very very short so I know a really long hair can't be mine.

It is a conservative campus and I am a conservative and I am a political science major looking for a challenge. Although professors are usually Christian and conservative,  they put on their Marxist and liberal thinking caps and made their students think about our own views; it was a challenge after all!

Campus is very much together; you could walk to all of your classes. There's a shuttle bus that runs every 15-20 minutes that will take you around campus when you're feeling lazy or the weather is bad. The faculty members I've experienced the past 3 years I've been there have been AMAZING. I've met the most knowledgeable individuals at the Psychology Department.

As a first in family minority student, I was reluctant to go to a big school not known to have a diverse student body. However, I’ve noticed the freshman student body is  more diverse than I expected and the school is not as big as I thought. I see many of the people in my hall around campus. The class sizes are small 15-25 students. The city of Oneonta is cute and transportation to the mall and other main spots is easily accessible. The RA’s are always there to help me with anything big or small. The freshman dorms seem to be the newest!

It's not perfect, but no college is. However, being a freshman, my transition from high school to college has been great. Most professors are super helpful and really like to challenge you. Campus safety is a goal that Rhode Island College strives to make their students feel. There is always RIC security driving through campus and many emergency push buttons all over. Which makes you feel very safe. The campus is small and beautiful and gives a home feeling like no other college I looked into. I am a commuter so I can not say what it is like living on campus. However the one downfall the college has is not enough parking spaces...Like ever. The school is mostly a commuter school which is cool, but parking can be horrendous depending on the time you have classes. Even with that one downfall RIC is an amazing school and I absolutely recommend looking into it!","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2016-11-22T23:55:17.202119Z","guid":"05a61093-ff03-43d9-ac63-7124842d7d3a","rating":5},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":2.66}],"photos":{"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-71.466915,41.84266,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-71.466915,41.84266,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.390829694323144,"count":916},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Providence, RI"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/rhode-island-college/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"d7a347a3-2d4a-4312-bff1-c0e26d828872","content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"Georgia College & State University","type":"College","url":"georgia-college--and--state-university"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.8452},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":19717},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"1030-1220"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Freshman","body":"My absolute favourite thing was how everyone was so friendly here! All the staff were very nice and helpful whenever I had any issues, which wasn't often in the first place because everyone was so helpful. Lots of my teachers seemed genuinely invested in how I was doing in their class and at GCSU in general.\nThe only thing I ever had an issue with was the mathematics department. Most teachers in that area did seem to care, but oftentimes I found they weren't able to teach the material quite as well as teachers in other areas. It would either be extremely difficult, with teachers going completely over my head, or very, very easy, with the teacher practically going back to basic high school math. It'd be nice to see some more focus on that area and to see it improve some.\nBut overall, this college has a very welcoming and warm environment and I'd recommend it to anyone looking for a good start to college.

Seton Hall athletics is one of the best parts of campus life. With 14 D1 sports teams there is always a game to watch and cheer on. The men's basketball team plays at the Prudential Center in Newark, NJ and they play in the Big East Conference. Going to basketball games is a highlight of the school year!\nOverall, social life on campus is awesome. There is always stuff to do on campus during the week and the weekends. Greek life is available on campus but will not make or break your experience.

Thank you Tufts!","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2018-05-17T21:26:13.050229Z","guid":"a8967dfd-8347-4e7a-8787-afec94828f47","rating":5},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":4.33}],"photos":{"default":{"author":"ekilby","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/42a86ec557cd8d803719d9a842b7e5cd448f1f9e.jpg","MobileHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/37f5674c56fac367a26a7e05a1e7ea319954b389.jpg","Thumbnail":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/5ef6db35bdb6bc2f7234f67f80905506041872f4"},"licenseName":"CC BY-SA","licenseUrl":"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/","sourceUrl":"https://www.flickr.com/photos/ekilby/14453107003/"},"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-71.120641,42.406004,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-71.120641,42.406004,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.6312785388127855,"count":876},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Medford, MA"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/tufts-university/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"aac5119e-1d55-4ba6-a400-0f0516c04d9b","content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"University of Missouri - St. Louis","type":"College","url":"university-of-missouri---st-louis"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.7062},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":8774},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"940-1080"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Senior","body":"Attending UMSL has been the most educationally enlightening experience of my life, and I have met some of the most creative, interesting and inspiring professors and students.  I believe with the knowledge I am acquiring and the ability to communicate with diverse audiences, I am inspired and motivated to seek higher education in order to create a better quality of life for me and my family. UMSL has opportunities for developing leadership, networking, mentoring and team concepts that can put you on a path to achieve your educational goal. Current statistics of high school dropout rates and lack of accreditation of schools convinces me there is an opportunity for me to become a part of the solution.  My passion is to help the youth.  I re-entered school to gain tools in communications.  I think I will be equipped and on my way to become an author and a public speaker after completing a degree in communications.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2018-04-24T17:56:15.095979Z","guid":"59ebd44e-f549-4ae2-9e17-58b8ce2f8bf5","rating":4},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":3}],"photos":{"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-90.308886,38.711297,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-90.308886,38.711297,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.44284128745838,"count":901},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Saint Louis, MO"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/university-of-missouri---st-louis/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"f093b4d9-45b1-41ba-8de6-4ef44451520c","content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":true,"isPremium":true,"name":"SUNY Geneseo","type":"College","url":"suny-geneseo"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.6685},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":17283},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"1090-1300"}],"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":3.33}],"photos":{"default":{"crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/276e505b360421412485f58936971f299e1974e5.jpg","MobileHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/e73abc6bcb056f4417710f0df3262cfd594254d2.jpg"},"licenseName":"UNLICENSED"},"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-77.821999,42.796864,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-77.821999,42.796864,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.6111744583808436,"count":877},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Geneseo, NY"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/suny-geneseo/#scatterplot"}}]}
