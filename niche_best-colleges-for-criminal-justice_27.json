They were all pretty friendly and helpful. All but the computer professor (of course) have a strong objection to electronics in the classroom, though, which I thought was a bit odd. I understand prohibiting cell phones in class. I do not understand prohibiting tablets or laptops, even if you're using them to take notes. Luckily I have accommodations to take notes electronically--otherwise, I'd be up a certain creek without a paddle. Most high schools use iPads or some other tablet/laptop now, in the classroom, so students coming in are obviously used to that; why prohibit it now? Anyway, the courses I took were great. Their quality was more or less impeccable. Class sizes are GREAT--usually 20-30. As to variety...their catalog says that French and German classes are available, but they're actually not, because they don't have anyone to teach them; as a result, the only available foreign language course is Spanish. I am tired of Spanish being the only language both offered and/or required in all schools, not just college. It's time to break out into other linguistic areas!","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2015-12-29T17:25:23Z","guid":"c3f4f03d-933f-41be-848b-589b4fb4ae81","rating":5},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":2.66}],"photos":{"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-81.970898,34.954585,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-81.970898,34.954585,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.5481927710843375,"count":166},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"2 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Spartanburg, SC"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/spartanburg-methodist-college/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"9a59f82f-2bd2-456f-8826-09b3a98f36e9","content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"Lincoln College","type":"College","url":"lincoln-college"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.6202},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":16123},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"610-810"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Sophomore","body":"I am a returning student enrolled in Lincoln College & my experience there has been great.The professors there are phenomenal they are willing to give you one on one help, well organized,& are always reasonable with students and other professors.

Also, the professors I have had so far are very well educated and care about student success. The cafeteria food is average and excellent at times. Winter drags on a little too long, but there are many things to do outdoors like skiing, ice-skating, or playing hockey. The summer season is exceptional and makes the winter weather worth it. The only advice I would give is to make the most out of the opportunities given and get involved.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2018-05-04T03:16:51.522787Z","guid":"e1cba19f-94ce-472e-9f59-61e1d49bd48d","rating":4},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":2.66}],"photos":{"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-68.588364,47.250306,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-68.588364,47.250306,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.5567010309278353,"count":97},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Fort Kent, ME"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/university-of-maine-at-fort-kent/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"111b04a0-e779-45f9-9053-b635424f6dc9","content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"Kentucky Wesleyan College","type":"College","url":"kentucky-wesleyan-college"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.5722},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":18265},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"870-1140"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Freshman","body":"I absolutely love attending Kentucky Wesleyan. Since it is a small provate school, class sizes are much smaller and more beneficial. All of the staff, from professors to mainteneance staff, know you and are very friendly. I live on campus, and the dorms are a little better than average. The campus food is also about average. Since the student body measures about 700, it seems as if everyone knows everyone, and cliques are almost nonexistent. Athletes are friends with the students in Greek life, who are friends with the students who participate in performing arts.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2017-12-22T21:30:15.797417Z","guid":"08c5b662-9b06-47d4-a30c-80ef775f4207","rating":5},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":2.66}],"photos":{"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-87.121984,37.744667,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-87.121984,37.744667,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.548611111111111,"count":144},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Owensboro, KY"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/kentucky-wesleyan-college/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"ca833e90-f2dc-4cbb-be3b-c2cd9594dd50","content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"Oklahoma Wesleyan University","type":"College","url":"oklahoma-wesleyan-university"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.728},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":24728},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"830-1100"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Junior","body":"Great christian school!
