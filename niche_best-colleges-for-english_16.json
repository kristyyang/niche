The location is a definite plus, as most New York attractions are just a short walk or subway ride away. The academics are exceptional and it is especially advantageous for Business majors to be located in the heart of Wall Street. Aside from that, there are many campus activities and clubs for students to join, and there is always free food available at one event or the other! The faculty are very helpful and they are invested in seeing students succeed, which can really help boost student morale. In addition to this, the university really pushes for real world experience, like internships, and the career services department is a great resource for students to utilize in their search for such experiences.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2018-04-19T04:46:05.82642Z","guid":"93484419-e007-4bae-9406-73c69997f6ac","rating":5},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":3}],"photos":{"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-74.004719,40.711014,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-74.004719,40.711014,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.5303896103896104,"count":1925},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"New York, NY"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/pace-university/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"e7815197-0633-40dd-b201-c5a0450986b8","content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":true,"isPremium":true,"name":"University of Tampa","type":"College","url":"university-of-tampa"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.483},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":29372},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"990-1160"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Sophomore","body":"Great and knowledgeable professors that are willing to help students.

In my second year here, I can say with certainty that everyone here is so friendly and always willing to help you. The professors are amazing and they will do everything they can to make sure you are understanding the concepts and succeeding academically. Another interesting thing about Quinnipiac is that it has many clubs and organizations available. In this way, each student can definitely find something that matches their hobbies and interests.

Every semester the school creates a new way to include its students from all walks of life. There are many organizations that are eager to gain new recruits; there are always emails and chalk drawings that invite people to join the UMBC community or show your Retriever Pride; and there are so many safe, private places to study or just relax without feeling like you're in the middle of nowhere.\nNot to mention you are a short bus-ride away from plenty of off-campus attractions, if you ever feel the need to escape campus life (many of these excursions are even organized by  the Student Events Board). \nThis is the perfect small campus, with a big college feel.

Although the general student body is fairy homogeneous and middle class, there is an ongoing push for diversity.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2017-03-24T15:54:01.859352Z","guid":"313a2e68-adff-409a-9a57-25995ec324a0","rating":4},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":3.33}],"photos":{"default":{"crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/8964002edde4e219f39ecadcbb1f61cf5ec6548f.jpg","MobileHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/d930c6723039a2632f131c582ba9b21d3af4b9dc.jpg"},"licenseName":"UNLICENSED"},"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-71.508177,42.985066,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-71.508177,42.985066,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.5595238095238093,"count":504},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Manchester, NH"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/saint-anselm-college/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"c2c8b653-06b8-4df0-bd10-ce8d530aa45c","content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"Le Moyne College","type":"College","url":"le-moyne-college"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.6531},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":23361},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"1000-1210"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Senior","body":"Le Moyne College is a small campus and offers small classes that I found very helpful and useful. Larger university classes weren’t for me, so Le Moyne was a perfect fit. The professors here actually get to know you and help you whenever needed, offering office hours and meetings by appointments. Le Moyne’s core curriculum requires all students of all majors to take different liberal arts classes, which I think is helpful for students who were unsure of their major starting out. The Jesuit education provided by Le Moyne is thorough and all around excellent. I also commuted to Le Moyne and I found that my professors were always understanding and accomodating if I were ever in the situation where I wouldn’t be able to attend class, such as weather conditions and other external forces that I wouldn’t be able to control. My experience at Le Moyne has been pleasant since day one, and I’m proud to be a soon-to-be graduate from this college.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2017-11-21T17:09:42.782005Z","guid":"cb2d8c6a-ef7d-4c92-be14-586f42c94485","rating":5},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":3}],"photos":{"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-76.088449,43.047316,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-76.088449,43.047316,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.5357142857142856,"count":532},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Syracuse, NY"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/le-moyne-college/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"c52d86cf-9ed3-461c-9aba-b7f10673c5cc","content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"University of North Texas","type":"College","url":"university-of-north-texas"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.7179},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":10424},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"980-1200"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Junior","body":"I have now attended UNT for almost 3 years now.

The classes are small, allowing for more personalized attention from professors. The campus is very involved, with plenty of groups and activities for all types of people. While being a non-denominational Christian college that requires some religious courses, the faculty and staff do not ostracize or penalize anyone for choosing another path in life. The only downsides to the college are the location (Kansas has little to do, and small town Kansas has less) and the cost. The private school is fairly expensive to attend.

I would never trade this for another \"typical\" school. In terms of academics, everything is accessible through student tutoring sessions, group review sessions (highly advisable). It's challenging (especially if you do the Honors College), but worth your while. THe study abroad programs are EXCELLENT. I did 2 of them myself, and definitely recommend it-- they find a way to finance whatever study abroad you want to do, through their scholarship office. \nI only take 1 star away because I was a commuter and did not enjoy VCU as much as the residential students.

I think I was hoping for a more traditional college experience, but Webster could be a great fit for you.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2018-03-19T00:31:53.007384Z","guid":"c2b71282-36b1-4935-b4be-b8ec0557d925","rating":4},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":3}],"photos":{"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-90.345654,38.589269,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-90.345654,38.589269,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.6701902748414374,"count":946},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Saint Louis, MO"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/webster-university/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"e418d93d-fc7f-4b07-b6fa-de2a6acdb946","content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"Northern Illinois University","type":"College","url":"northern-illinois-university"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.5184},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":19782},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"900-1120"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Freshman","body":"I'm currently a Music Education major. Class sizes are perfect for this major, nothing too big or small so the professors can spend a lot of time working 1 on 1 with students who need more help. Professors are as nice as ever besides a couple. The campus is beautiful and I love my dorm room. I'd like to see less violence, last semester Fall '17, we had to lock the outside doors during the day and night at all times, which was insanely annoying. It's not too much of a problem now.

The campus and facilities are top notch and the University is constantly expanding with the addition of new buildings/facilities. The faculty and staff have been extremely helpful in making sure I am on track and taking the right classes to meet my degree requirements. With Division 1 Baseball, Football, Basketball, and Soccer, as well as a plethora of intramural sports and special interest clubs, there is always something to do on campus.
