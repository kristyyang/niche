Coming to UNM has been an amazing experience because not only have I've met sensational friends but also I've been able to grow as a student. This university has been able to provide helpful resources like CAPS tutoring and awesome organizations to get involved in. I'm currently in the ASUNM Community Experience group, where we've been able to  connect with a diverse amount of people by volunteering and helping out within the university and Albuquerque. Living on campus has also been an incredible experience because of our close net community. Every week there is something to do on campus, especially in the dormitories, like: cuddling a canine, carnivals, free movies and most importantly free food/snacks! Being a part of UNM has given me unforgettable memories, close friends and fun experiences.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2018-04-17T01:21:56.060697Z","guid":"451c1596-1fe1-4cbb-9206-0efc9e28370c","rating":5},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":3}],"photos":{"default":{"crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/24131ce06dea388526bedc6ad307882eb9da3219.jpg","MobileHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/062851d99af8e29d786a585ae1faa1c045b34c54.jpg"},"licenseName":"UNLICENSED"},"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-106.620155,35.083868,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-106.620155,35.083868,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.474596896866444,"count":3287},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Albuquerque, NM"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/university-of-new-mexico/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"50bc7f23-7318-429a-838b-25967d9178a0","content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"California State University - Northridge","type":"College","url":"california-state-university---northridge"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.4824},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":6574},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"800-1030"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Freshman","body":"My overall experience with California State University Northridge has been outstanding.

There is plenty there if you grab it.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2018-05-25T19:01:31.291123Z","guid":"5e5fed39-5d34-462e-9cae-0ed359833037","rating":5},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":2.66}],"photos":{"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-83.624499,42.245751,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-83.624499,42.245751,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.4503844745514463,"count":2731},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Ypsilanti, MI"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/eastern-michigan-university/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"25744055-bf58-4a30-91b3-07c2a15b4f29","content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"California State University - Los Angeles","type":"College","url":"california-state-university---los-angeles"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.637},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":3933},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"780-980"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Freshman","body":"Overall, Cal State LA (CSULA) is a very excellent university to study for either your undergraduate or graduate years. I find that CSULA is very safety-conscious, maintains an excellent campus environment and student life, and hires very impressive and motivated professors who instill knowledge and their own passions into the students they teach. However, if there are two aspects that I would like to see CSULA improve on, they would be the local area and campus food. I would appreciate it if there were interesting activities to participate in in the local area and if there was a much bigger variety of healthy food choices aside from the food trucks and the food court.

Graduates of LU enter their field of study with confidence and experience, being professional in their careers and driven to reach their goals. 10/10!","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2018-05-19T16:22:54.650876Z","guid":"9fe818a9-358f-4412-98d3-a7df6d1a8c04","rating":5},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":3.33}],"photos":{"default":{"crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/3995a6f5e69e8e6fe7d3983b1c651117e87a8feb.jpg","MobileHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/4f889192aaade67e2859453cfd3547836451a37e.jpg"},"licenseName":"UNLICENSED"},"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-79.179688,37.350345,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-79.179688,37.350345,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":4.004973577867578,"count":6434},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Lynchburg, VA"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/liberty-university/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"8cd719a3-9f66-4a61-a1eb-f2a312b02acc","content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"University of Missouri","type":"College","url":"university-of-missouri"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.747},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":16317},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"1020-1290"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Senior","body":"University of Missouri- Columbia is a school that allows such a variety of studies that almost anyone can find a major they will enjoy pursuing. Personally, it was one of only a few schools in Missouri with my emphasis area of Nuclear Medicine Technologist which is a major reason I choose to attend this school. This decision was a great one because Mizzou has helped me grow personally, emotionally, religiously, and in so many other ways.

The campus is real beautiful; coming from LA, I've never seen so many trees in one spot. The professors I've had have been great and I've taken away valuable information from their classes and applied that information to my everyday life. One thing I do wish was different would be the amount of students that are accepted. With so many students here, it's very difficult to get into the classes necessary to graduate. There are a lot of impacted majors, but that is because the programs Sac State offers have to be some of the best in the country; so, it's understandable. Other than that, Sac State is a very great school. Everyone here, including the staff, is very friendly and willing to help others out when they're lost or have any questions about anything. I'm glad to be a hornet!","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2018-02-06T21:45:43.94191Z","guid":"138c54b3-27d1-451c-8e93-d8f26e84bf75","rating":4},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":3}],"photos":{"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-121.42194,38.55745,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-121.42194,38.55745,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.595684803001876,"count":3198},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Sacramento, CA"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/california-state-university---sacramento/#scatterplot"}}]}
