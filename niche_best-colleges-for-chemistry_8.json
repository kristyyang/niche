When I came here, I was incredibly shy, but my professors and peers encouraged me to step out of my comfort zone.

Despite ECU's avid party life and prevalent Greek culture, you can expect to make the best of your experience and get a quality education!","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2018-02-09T14:31:47.300782Z","guid":"3408928a-e9f4-4745-9f24-5719855d0feb","rating":4},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":3.33}],"photos":{"default":{"crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/e72f4e2343ba7c186a4b9e0c97f476da86b95e0b.jpg","MobileHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/ebf486e743c87abc25a5ed790054eb3d5294baad.jpg"},"licenseName":"UNLICENSED"},"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-77.366199,35.606347,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-77.366199,35.606347,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.7252167357708257,"count":2653},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Greenville, NC"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/east-carolina-university/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"88959d7a-13e8-4fba-be19-a0c9c7976a9a","content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"University of Wyoming","type":"College","url":"university-of-wyoming"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.9508},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":13155},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"960-1210"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Sophomore","body":"I love the classes for my major offered by the University.

I couldn't BEAR being anywhere else!","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2018-05-26T18:34:40.488877Z","guid":"f6ddd6de-5030-499c-a5f6-13e33b98c114","rating":5},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":3}],"photos":{"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-93.276821,37.197983,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-93.276821,37.197983,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.6702761234434216,"count":1847},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Springfield, MO"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/missouri-state-university/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"84d212db-1ef1-4f97-8b18-4d5f1f8525f4","content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"Texas Lutheran University","type":"College","url":"texas-lutheran-university"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.4261},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":20694},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"880-1070"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Freshman","body":"TLU have been a blast, I have very good professors who explain things I may have a problem understanding on. I have a great schedule that fits how I work. I've got the chance to become friends with a whole lot of people I would not have met usually. Lots of them comes from places miles away which boggles my mind! I have found my classes very interesting and not too difficult, Just gotta keep up on whats going on! The only major problem I have is the mytlu website we use to access lots of things is a little difficult to navigate through when it comes to finding things such as student employment and some things aren't able to be found online such as some events. Other than That I really am enjoying TLU and blessed I even get the chance to attend this amazing university.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2018-01-31T05:32:35.153213Z","guid":"3e285b69-5a49-4321-bf3f-5fa6ab099c5c","rating":4},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":3}],"photos":{"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-97.984601,29.573274,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-97.984601,29.573274,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.603938730853392,"count":457},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Seguin, TX"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/texas-lutheran-university/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"d9af4a17-36e6-4039-8b42-83022cf18eb0","content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"Bluffton University","type":"College","url":"bluffton-university"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.4953},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":25101},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"840-1140"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Niche User","body":"When I visited Bluffton University I absolutely loved the campus. It was clean, beautiful, and the students and staff were very welcoming. Their admissions advisor Kaitlin Kerr was amazing. She helped me decide on a major that matched my interests and she also told me everything that Bluffton had to offer me. There classrooms were very neat and their classes are small which is what I loved the most. They have tutors available all day if you need them and the professors are always willing to help their students.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2018-04-19T17:08:23.821438Z","guid":"0faf431d-00db-40f3-ae7b-139d3998fce0","rating":5},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":3}],"photos":{"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-83.897678,40.896998,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-83.897678,40.896998,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.5445544554455446,"count":303},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Bluffton, OH"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/bluffton-university/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"2b70a107-42b2-4c9e-af8e-998796402661","content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"Emory & Henry College","type":"College","url":"emory--and--henry-college"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.699},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":21160},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"890-1120"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Niche User","body":"Its a beautiful campus in Southwestern Virginia.

The tuition is a little high, but given it is a private liberal arts college that should be expected. It is definitely worth the money.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2018-04-12T17:55:42.475473Z","guid":"cb039381-7240-4d7c-bc47-12049e2acf68","rating":5},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":3}],"photos":{"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-81.831737,36.772543,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-81.831737,36.772543,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.6744186046511627,"count":215},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Emory, VA"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/emory--and--henry-college/#scatterplot"}}]}
