When I visited the campus for the first time in snowy January 2015 from Phoenix, Arizona, my mind had a culture shock. Despite the weather (which I am now used to), I fell in love with Case and the nursing school because of the commitment to intelligence and hands-on learning. When I was in my second week of college ever, I was in the hospital interacting with patients. I even helped save someone's life before my first semester ended. Case shows so much dedication to its students and professors take the time to work with every individual. I have never regretted my decision coming here, and found so many opportunities-- such as working at the Cleveland Clinic and as a camp counselor-- along the way.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2018-04-10T05:04:44.946485Z","guid":"7f6fc096-dafb-40e1-bf11-ec7010f99fd9","rating":5},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":4.33}],"photos":{"default":{"crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/4b29c2cc89cb00630ed76c78f1742f7cbd955937.jpg","MobileHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/be63111181f595f7fedd66a1263fd5c297237aa6.jpg","Thumbnail":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/399c6e8abeae5ae7a4323a2607a607885e9ed2ca"},"licenseName":"UNLICENSED"},"mapbox_header":{"crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-81.605769,41.500812,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-81.605769,41.500812,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"UNLICENSED"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.536723163841808,"count":1593},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Cleveland, OH"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/case-western-reserve-university/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"ecbc8d55-b1c6-4b90-8c3a-322cf655b115","badge":{"display":"Best Colleges for Computer Science in America","ordinal":52,"total":494,"vanityURL":"best-colleges-for-computer-science"},"content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":true,"isPremium":true,"name":"Worcester Polytechnic Institute","type":"College","url":"worcester-polytechnic-institute"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.4844},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":40666},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"1310-1480"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Sophomore","body":"Very good school for those who are technically inclined and/or interested in engineering.

Find a place that feels like home, because it will become just that.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2018-05-07T20:21:56.171857Z","guid":"4c6fac8a-21e0-47b7-af85-cf5201a28535","rating":5},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":4.33}],"photos":{"default":{"crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/e392de297d5c0217fa9163e34be17ba2dbb7a3c5.jpg","MobileHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/beb6eae11f106ef55eec6ee45c4cf304a6650c00.jpg","Thumbnail":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/3498b09544f1ae199377093a18adba8c7514853e"},"licenseName":"UNLICENSED"},"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-76.709395,37.27195,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-76.709395,37.27195,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.572655690765927,"count":1397},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Williamsburg, VA"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/college-of-william--and--mary/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"a0da9562-a209-49c5-af5d-fd157a9441a3","badge":{"display":"Best Colleges for Computer Science in America","ordinal":64,"total":494,"vanityURL":"best-colleges-for-computer-science"},"content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"Wesleyan University","type":"College","url":"wesleyan-university"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.1785},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":20490},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"1300-1480"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Alum","body":"Wesleyan's professors make the school.

I see lots of different schools and interact with dozens of student populations. Each campus has a different vibe and feel, and conversations in campus coffee shops range from purely academic to purely social. I loved Middlebury for the blend of high caliber academics, a hardworking student body, and a focus on active, healthy lifestyles. Students at Middlebury balance work and play, and a weekend was never without hours in the library or miles of hiking, running or biking. The teachers have high expectations for your work, but they understand there's more to get out of college than acing every exam. As I tour college campuses today, I look for candidates who strike that same balance, who take their work seriously, but they don't take themselves too seriously. That's what Middlebury is about.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2018-02-14T22:01:07.442777Z","guid":"539b0218-3556-4d2a-bd12-0d882aa28acf","rating":5},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":4.33}],"photos":{"default":{"author":"nancieshelburnemuseum","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/c7dab09e874e9dc1c9f67b919a524daca66c766e.jpg","MobileHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/bee6c4ec7223ca60becf94d85b9239006619756a.jpg","Thumbnail":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/c979f1762857254a1de8cca3b00a8cd840a6e2b5"},"licenseName":"CC BY ","licenseUrl":"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/2.0/","sourceUrl":"https://www.flickr.com/photos/nancieshelburnemuseum/7711386868/"},"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-73.176068,44.009117,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-73.176068,44.009117,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.740663900414938,"count":482},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Middlebury, VT"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/middlebury-college/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"94a3b32f-7213-4ea2-bc3a-5aa612b3850c","badge":{"display":"Best Colleges for Computer Science in America","ordinal":67,"total":494,"vanityURL":"best-colleges-for-computer-science"},"content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"University of Richmond","type":"College","url":"university-of-richmond"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.3248},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":22400},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"1220-1420"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Freshman","body":"Everything is pretty awesome here.
