It is a small campus so you most likely know everyone in the classroom. The further in your major you get, the more attention and help you will get from your professor because your class size will be so small. The professors seem intimidating in the basic classes because they are trying to \"weed out\" the student who do not belong in the major, but as you progress they are your greatest helpers. The professors just want to see you succeed. As far as campus involvement, there is a lot to do on campus during the week but less on the weekend because it is generally a commuter campus.

One of my favorite things about Keuka College is that it is a small campus and everyone you see is a familiar face. You are likely to develop a personal bond with most/all of your professors, and your professors know you by name, you're not just a number. If you are struggling in one of your classes, you can go to your professors office hours and get all of the help you need. Your professors set you up for success, not for failure. The campus is small and everything is within walking distance, which is really nice, especially when you're in a hurry. The college tries their best to offer activities for you to keep you busy, and of course, the lake being right in your backyard is a huge benefit!","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2017-01-24T00:22:25.334457Z","guid":"d489e6a2-8177-4803-9690-b53b0aef2c33","rating":4},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":2.66}],"photos":{"default":{"crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/e7eac12490c47bda531ce5c6250459f21c38535f.jpg","MobileHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/63f2c575d68f4a0a999f9dee228836318833513b.jpg"},"licenseName":"UNLICENSED"},"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-77.090518,42.61541,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-77.090518,42.61541,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.309823677581864,"count":397},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Keuka Park, NY"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/keuka-college/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"ffad4faa-e758-4269-bf49-a728cd7e06c7","content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"Claflin University","type":"College","url":"claflin-university"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.4182},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":17241},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"830-950"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Junior","body":"There are many different elements that make Claflin great, but the main one is class sizes and the atmosphere is family-like.

Some days inside the buildings would be hotter than outside.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2018-04-19T23:22:10.198645Z","guid":"54616b70-eef3-4720-8fd1-53991ec05e30","rating":4},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":2.66}],"photos":{"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-80.854368,33.497367,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-80.854368,33.497367,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.3775137111517366,"count":1094},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Orangeburg, SC"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/claflin-university/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"fc5cb7de-5f46-4c11-9e46-2b2b2fdfad06","content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"Cazenovia College","type":"College","url":"cazenovia-college"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.8988},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":17349},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"843-1090"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Niche User","body":"I haven't yet started my college years there yet, but i plan to in the fall of 2018, but when i went for my campus tour, I loved every minute of it.

We had a great season which featured playoff appearances as a team, and individually, I started every game and scored two game winning goals as a freshman. My coach put lots of faith in me. In the classroom, professors were very involved and seemed to care a lot more than typical college professors. I finished with a 3.6 GPA. The campus is beautiful and small.

Upper Iowa also offers an different approach to semesters, offering \"sessions\" so you take your classes in eight weeks. I take two classes each eight weeks, thirty three per school year.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2018-04-05T03:25:00.177235Z","guid":"72b923e0-2fff-427a-b269-c158a1cc66b5","rating":5},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":2.33}],"photos":{"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-91.799663,42.840293,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-91.799663,42.840293,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.6040100250626566,"count":399},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Fayette, IA"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/upper-iowa-university/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"50bc7f23-7318-429a-838b-25967d9178a0","content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"California State University - Northridge","type":"College","url":"california-state-university---northridge"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.4824},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":6574},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"800-1030"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Freshman","body":"My overall experience with California State University Northridge has been outstanding. This school has everything you need and is covered in your tuition. Before college I was looking for a diverse and aesthetically pleasing campus, and this gave me all of this and more. Northridge has one the  best art school in the country. They offer several free tutoring, therapist, doctors, and more. The professors have great credentials and want the best for your learning experience, one just needs to look at their background prior to the class. They do not have the best sport team but this an easy fix to their overall performance. They have a high-tech gym that offer numerous classes, equipment, and facilities. The party scene is great. It is not too much or less but the right amount.

From the green trees that stretch to the rolling hills all summer long to the snow that makes the college look like it's something out of hogwarts. This college is ideal for people who prefer to have a close relationship with both the student body and the professors. Plenty of opportunity is presented for the students to be involved during the school year along with priming the seniors who will graduate jobs and connections for careers. The convenience of a 10 min walk max to whatever you need on campus is great! If you are an introvert who prefers to spend long intimate nights with Netflix, you can do that here. I would highly not recommend it because the thing about this college is that we are family here, you'll be surrounded by quality friends whom you can create the best of memories with if you choose to be involved with them.

The professors in my department have been very helpful and friendly with everything and the professors do care about their students. They do want to help when you have a problem and do care about their students. There is a lot of work, but it actually teaches you and the lectures are very engaging due to the small class sizes.

In classrooms, I am able to understand all the professors without having to worry about misunderstanding them if I were using an interpreter.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2018-05-18T17:03:14.259383Z","guid":"8aa667fd-4128-474e-a2b9-c38ff5474d19","rating":5},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":3}],"photos":{"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-76.993675,38.907371,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-76.993675,38.907371,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.471014492753623,"count":414},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Washington, DC"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/gallaudet-university/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"7882fac4-5ed2-4fd6-bc3b-228bf86d7915","content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"Franklin Pierce University","type":"College","url":"franklin-pierce-university"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.8139},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":29136},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"870-1070"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Freshman","body":"The faculty and students are very welcoming and happy!
