There's acres of college woods too!\nMost on-campus dorms represent a theme so that everyone can feel like they belong. \nThe courses are hard-professors expect you to study out of class, but they have office hours and are willing to stay after class with you.\nCFAR helps you find study plans, discover what kind of learner you are, and figure out how to tackle difficult classes. There's free tutoring if needed\nUNH works with most study abroad programs. It's discovery credit system makes it easy for credits to transfer towards your major. \nFor food It's in the top 1% of USA. There's 3 dining halls as well as shops all around campus. It's unbelievable(trust me on this)\nD1 Aka sports events are crazy. Football/hockey is intense; there's huge tailgate parties\nGreek life and sports teams have their own houses so the parties are good.\nSo many clubs/orgs. It's super easy to stay active and get involved on campus.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2017-09-15T05:02:30.978588Z","guid":"26d4be99-3336-4c13-84de-f9e924cd59ed","rating":5},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":3.66}],"photos":{"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-70.934512,43.134235,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-70.934512,43.134235,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.6387771520514884,"count":2486},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Durham, NH"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/university-of-new-hampshire/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"df484f3c-7077-4333-82f7-ea5dfa247c7c","content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":true,"isPremium":false,"name":"D'Youville College","type":"College","url":"dyouville-college"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.8057},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":20174},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"900-1090"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Junior","body":"Attending this college was the best decision I've ever made. I am very pleased with the quality of my education and the professors. I am enrolled in the Occupational Therapy BS/MS program and I have learned so much in the past 2 years. However, with the new president, there have been a lot of misplaced concern on what needs to be improved. The professors have been teaching without a contract for months which should be our administrations first priority. After that, the parking situation for this college made up of a majority of commuters should be addressed and the improving our existing buildings and facilities. New fields, gyms (for a D3 school), and other unnecessary expenses should be halted and priorities should be checked.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2018-05-29T19:51:14.696528Z","guid":"9a46a6aa-05d8-486a-8b23-58ef5b15707f","rating":4},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":2.66}],"photos":{"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-78.890369,42.902263,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-78.890369,42.902263,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.3380281690140845,"count":355},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Buffalo, NY"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/dyouville-college/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"8dba5571-9c2b-4c81-9db6-14b9cbbdb67b","badge":{"display":"Best Colleges in America","ordinal":610,"total":1644,"vanityURL":"best-colleges"},"content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"SUNY Fredonia","type":"College","url":"suny-fredonia"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.6235},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":16622},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"900-1120"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Sophomore","body":"I like Fredonia for the most part, I live off-campus, and I think the student life seems rather dull, outside looking in. However, the academics are decent and it's a good school. I feel like some facilities could be improved, like Thompson Hall. I believe the latter houses the History, Psychology, and Teaching departments, but the building itself is rather dreary. They recently repainted the walls which is nice! The diversity is also very good, as an LGBT student, it's very accepting here and I appreciate it a lot. As for race and socioeconomic backgrounds, it's diverse in those aspects as well! I really like this school, but as a local, I can tell you that Fredonia itself is a pretty boring town, however I've noticed that many students from NYC appreciate that.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2018-01-20T08:04:05.042899Z","guid":"dd3407fb-96bb-4744-9704-16e57139c800","rating":4},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":3}],"photos":{"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-79.336109,42.450961,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-79.336109,42.450961,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.5501379944802207,"count":1087},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Fredonia, NY"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/suny-fredonia/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"7d5d7efb-e6ab-45ce-8118-b03268d479b9","content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"Tuskegee University","type":"College","url":"tuskegee-university"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.4999},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":28515},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"890-1110"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Sophomore","body":"Its an amazing school!

I am never worried about making friends of different backgrounds, or finding my niche with those who share my cultural background because it happens so naturally. There are also plenty of religious groups to get plugged into on and around campus. My only complaint is the Hill, but it is worth it to live in Pomfret Hall with bigger bathrooms, a nice common area, and the dining hall which comes in handy on days of inclement weather.

The staff are amazing; they'll invite you over to eat and talk and are always available if you have quesions. The campus itself is sort of tucked away in its own little community and has a nice feel to it. If you like the outdoors it's even better because of the 35+ miles of biking and hiking trails.

It is a beautiful school on a gorgeous mountain in rural Emmitsburg, MD. The small student to professor ratio gives each student the opportunity to personally get to know each professor and to build a professional, but personal relationship with each faculty and staff member. The other students and members of the Mount community including coaches, priests, seminarians, and alumni are very involved in the school and try to make the students feel a part of a larger community. I have enjoyed each moment at the Mount because it has become my home away from home! Seriously, I call it home even when I am away from it! If I had to go through the college selection process again, I would still choose the Mount. Even though it is an older school in a country area, the people have made my three years at the Mount feel like I am in the city on a new campus. The community definitely sets the Mount apart from the many schools I toured.

This school opens you up to making connections in material and in the real world. I went straight to NYC for a decade, two weeks after graduating from SMC.

Academia in SJU is guided by deans and advisors of your choosing in your given college but remember, like in any college and a lesson to hold throughout your years: fight for what you want!","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2018-06-03T05:48:06.645741Z","guid":"44f4c2a8-2371-4698-b0b7-0943ac8feee4","rating":4},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":3}],"photos":{"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-73.795301,40.721979,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-73.795301,40.721979,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.606974209952779,"count":2753},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Queens, NY"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/st-johns-university---new-york/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"3237dfac-86c4-4b87-832a-c473806a5f67","badge":{"display":"Best Colleges in America","ordinal":627,"total":1644,"vanityURL":"best-colleges"},"content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":true,"isPremium":false,"name":"Wartburg College","type":"College","url":"wartburg-college"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.6825},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":22416},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"902-1070"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Sophomore","body":"Wartburg is defiantly worth it! I've met the best friends and people along the way. Everybody makes it feel like home and are so welcoming. There are tons of diversity people on campus and we are all involved in helping them fit in and having the best experience in the states as possible. The teachers are all understanding and want to be a parent influence when you're there since our parents aren't there to help us when it's needed.  Overall the education programs are amazing and I can't wait for my Nursing program to start. The food is really good and they have different variety's of food. For example, I am vegetarian so they have vegetarian dishes available everyday 3 times a day. I love Wartburg and I'm glad I chose this school to help me with my education.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2018-06-02T01:20:22.256543Z","guid":"be6adf9b-4bca-4a6a-b710-5bd017fe9fd9","rating":4},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":3}],"photos":{"default":{"crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/39117a22e32d197805f6b3c9e2b155b12dbfccb0.jpg","MobileHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/c79dcc92727238997d763d0a98463e79cfd64a52.jpg"},"licenseName":"UNLICENSED"},"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-92.480933,42.727629,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-92.480933,42.727629,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.4751381215469612,"count":543},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Waverly, IA"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/wartburg-college/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"5a7c4edd-4bc3-4f74-bc35-03477c8e0759","content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":true,"isPremium":false,"name":"Millikin University","type":"College","url":"millikin-university"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.638},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":21935},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"910-1080"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Alum","body":"I would not trade my 4 years at MU for anything! I absolutely loved it there even though Decatur can be a sketchy area, this campus is beautiful and old which makes it rich in history and tradition. The student body is decently diverse. The theatre program is amazing as well as the music program. The faculty truly cares for every student. The small campus gives you the close knit family vibe. The townies can be ratchet though. Another fun fact is that it is haunted! I have sooo many spooky experiences :) best food spots drunk or sober are Burrito Truck, First Wok, Donnie’s & University Dogs.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2018-05-03T03:08:56.228022Z","guid":"4ab869f8-d239-4976-9a29-e5e9502bdcac","rating":5},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":2.66}],"photos":{"default":{"crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/9c685a9c11b680024ad87ce30e6bca36f3f814b1.jpg","MobileHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/7c4cd65515a1aa6b0c2b86d5e87c64df1be75c7b.jpg"},"licenseName":"UNLICENSED"},"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-88.974571,39.842604,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-88.974571,39.842604,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.431654676258993,"count":556},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Decatur, IL"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/millikin-university/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"be55a524-961a-4400-b925-56f2a4723a9e","badge":{"display":"Best Colleges in America","ordinal":597,"total":1644,"vanityURL":"best-colleges"},"content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"Indiana Wesleyan University","type":"College","url":"indiana-wesleyan-university"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.7388},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":19519},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"920-1170"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Alum","body":"I had an excellent experience at this university during my three and a half years there. I had numerous opportunities to explore my passions and excel in my academics. I was employed in several on-campus positions including Residence Life and had wonderful opportunities in the Psychology department. I did find that some restrictions were a bit drastic compared to the way I was raised and there are some aspects of the campus culture that I could have done without; however, my overall experience was made amazing by my participation in the John Wesley Honors College! I would recommend this university to any student looking to pursue excellence and who doesn't mind a slightly conservative environment.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2018-02-19T19:58:45.398024Z","guid":"f170150f-b3f0-46bc-a900-e8e0d9185a1b","rating":4},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":3}],"photos":{"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-85.661991,40.518495,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-85.661991,40.518495,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.879144385026738,"count":935},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Marion, IN"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/indiana-wesleyan-university/#scatterplot"}}]}
