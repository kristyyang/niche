It was a great, Goldilocks type campus that wasn't too small, or too big; but just right. It really made my college experience memorable to have such amazing professors that treated you like an individual. Even though it was memorable, it wasn't always in a good way. My Penn State GA advisor for my major gave me the wrong plan and I ended up having to go back an extra semester for one French III course that I didn't know I had to take. Penn State paid for me to go back, but because I was no longer considered a full-time student, my loans came due as soon as I received my degree. Not always the best choice, but definitely a good choice if you are staying near the Pittsburgh area and want a medium sized campus.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2018-05-30T16:09:10.824134Z","guid":"46f86b70-5bc9-4f00-a2df-52243f1573d2","rating":4},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":2.66}],"photos":{"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-79.827262,40.344474,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-79.827262,40.344474,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.3632075471698113,"count":212},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"McKeesport, PA"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/penn-state-greater-allegheny/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"5fa55757-834a-4b82-bf8d-4254c74304c6","content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"Calumet College of St. Joseph","type":"College","url":"calumet-college-of-st-joseph"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.337786},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":11346},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"780-940"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Niche User","body":"My experience at this school was great.

I chose this program because I am living in Europe, and needed to find a program that didn't require me to be in a 'cyber' classroom during specific times of the day.  The professors were all very accessible and responsive and the coursework was interesting and well delivered.  Additionally, the registrar department was exceptionally helpful and kind.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2017-05-19T12:22:32.540845Z","guid":"4547f917-8f20-45a6-a0f8-c63066be59ba","rating":5},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":1.66}],"photos":{"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-103.186948,32.775496,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-103.186948,32.775496,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.7,"count":30},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Hobbs, NM"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/university-of-the-southwest/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"8143484e-5f25-4591-b346-50513c27dba4","content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"Paine College","type":"College","url":"paine-college"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.2458},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":16530},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"620-830"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Sophomore","body":"Paine College is a small campus.

The academics, though limited, offered amazing career choices. The soccer field where I dreamed of playing was one like none I’ve ever seen. Situated in the mountain with scenic views that in the fall season looked like something out of a painting. \n     In the fall of 2016 my dream became reality as I began my life as an SVC student athlete. Academics and being part of a great woman’s soccer team made my first year all I had hoped It would be. The small campus fits my needs and the surrounding areas offer many opportunities for me to fulfill my wanderlust with hiking, snowboarding, mountain biking and many other adventurous activities.
