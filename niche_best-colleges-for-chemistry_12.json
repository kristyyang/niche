The informational session for the Honors College was so helpful in helping me make my final decision to attend here at Oakland University. Everyone here is so approachable and kind. The classrooms are very nice, not to mention the Oak View Honors dorms! This is a beautiful building and has very nice dorms.

I feel excited to come to school and learn now, after feeling burnt out after my first two years. Additionally, there are so many helpful resources to help better your education including an enormous library and success coaches! My success coach has helped me overcome my fear, nervousness, and pushed me to be a better student.

There's free tutoring if needed\nUNH works with most study abroad programs. It's discovery credit system makes it easy for credits to transfer towards your major. \nFor food It's in the top 1% of USA. There's 3 dining halls as well as shops all around campus.

The food is pretty good at the kitchen, and there's plenty of restaurants scattered about campus.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2018-02-06T16:29:25.942781Z","guid":"de589bea-1847-423b-b574-154384f83106","rating":4},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":3}],"photos":{"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-84.301356,37.740396,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-84.301356,37.740396,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.4942938659058487,"count":1402},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Richmond, KY"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/eastern-kentucky-university/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"5397fb8a-dbb0-4bcd-8a6d-41da2249323d","content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"Minnesota State University, Mankato","type":"College","url":"minnesota-state-university-mankato"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.6249},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":13812},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"886-1106"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Sophomore","body":"I really enjoy all that the school has to offer in terms of extracurriculars.

Also, the beaches can eat up your entire day so maybe study first. \nThe Ugly: Tuition is insane. Highly recommend finding places to donate plasma/blood/etc or do some busking to help with tuition.

It's also a good size to get from one end to the other, unlike some of the \nlarge campuses I'd seen. The grounds are well-lit, clean, and pretty. There are a number of housing options once you decide you're done with dorm life, including many homes for rent in the area. I like that we are taught by the professors and not aides. I appreciate that we don't have to be entered onto a waiting list for entry into specialized studies pertaining to our majors. I do feel that Whitewater athletics should be recognized more statewide, as we have some of the best athletes/teams around! The student enrollment is diverse, allowing interactions with people not only from around the US but the world! And tuition is more affordable than some of the other state universities, yet we get the same (or better) educational offerings. My experience with UWW has been very enjoyable.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2017-11-05T15:32:20.832692Z","guid":"459f27a1-bebe-444b-bd0e-0daa5bb56f06","rating":5},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":3}],"photos":{"default":{"crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/377333c08fe7891f2723cf399dd03a2977a17962.jpg","MobileHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/6b205393e1ddcb9e045bd0682a63f3ff4b421836.jpg"},"licenseName":"UNLICENSED"},"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-88.742368,42.835563,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-88.742368,42.835563,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.535,"count":1200},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Whitewater, WI"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/university-of-wisconsin---whitewater/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"58126fe1-84f7-46c2-b313-1f41fff63229","content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"University of Massachusetts - Lowell","type":"College","url":"university-of-massachusetts---lowell"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.6057},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":18348},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"1070-1260"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Sophomore","body":"It's in a great location in Lowell! There's great places to eat around and on campus. The community is very diverse and everyone is pleasant. You won't feel out of place. There's a great amount of things to do in Lowell for music as well as just walking around. The professors are great and are willing to help those who seek help. The school staff is very helpful as well and very knowledgeable. If one person cannot help you, they will find the right person or department that can. The only downside is the construction that's going on right now, but it is to improve some of the older hallways.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2017-10-17T20:03:18.350952Z","guid":"5da2d139-a376-49d1-aa58-6946e027cac1","rating":5},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":3.33}],"photos":{"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-71.325081,42.65372,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-71.325081,42.65372,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.5735950044603033,"count":1121},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Lowell, MA"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/university-of-massachusetts---lowell/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"08e4512d-1b69-4961-b165-881c7fb2b953","content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":true,"isPremium":false,"name":"Indiana University of Pennsylvania","type":"College","url":"indiana-university-of-pennsylvania"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.9154},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":17264},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"840-1050"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Graduate Student","body":"The Indiana University of Pennsylvania (IUP) is a wonderful institution for higher education.  IUP has a strong network of professors from a variety of backgrounds and experiences, which allows for a multitude of learning opportunities.  The campus is absolutely stunning with its mixture of  up-to-date academic buildings, alongside historic buildings that have been standing since the incorporation of the university.  The university aims to have a very diverse community of faculty and students, which it successfully accomplishes through its various academic programs and events.  The university is nestled in the small city of Indiana, Pennsylvania.  There are plenty of restaurants, shops, and bars along Philadelphia Street to keep students entertained in the evenings and on the weekends.  Overall, I have received a quality education at IUP, and I would certainly recommend the university to others!","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2017-06-14T00:34:38.38611Z","guid":"216f6226-49ec-497e-86db-e5d5160ea815","rating":5},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":2.66}],"photos":{"default":{"crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/7c0a4013a571b3a4a1264b3cb67be13d334effcc.jpg","MobileHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/dbc91e581f5249282986d93e1f6cabd86c38fca7.jpg"},"licenseName":"UNLICENSED"},"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-79.159869,40.615589,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-79.159869,40.615589,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.479651162790698,"count":2408},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Indiana, PA"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/indiana-university-of-pennsylvania/#scatterplot"}}]}
