It's really easy to become very involved in the campus life, both as a commuter and as a resident. I've had good experiences with all of the staff in a variety of offices on campus. The College has also given me lots of opportunity, in terms of research, working on campus, and interacting with peers. In addition, I love the campus itself. We're located in the valley of the Ramapo mountains, with the Reservation right down the road. In the spring and fall particularly, the campus looks absolutely beautiful.

The campus is smaller than most which allows you to really get to know the other students. It starts to feel more like home once you begin to get to know a lot of people and feels more welcome. Everybody for the most part is friendly and the professor are really interesting and you will definitely learn a lot from them. The campus buildings are all close together so you don't have to walk more than ten minutes to class, which is great! There are multiple clubs and organizations to fit any interest and all of them focus on community and building relationships. The only thing I would change is to have more police officers present at night near the library for people who walk back to their dorms alone.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2018-01-31T18:17:00.628444Z","guid":"068da44f-58a8-49a6-8ad9-9189f7508c82","rating":5},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":3}],"photos":{"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-92.45931,35.078196,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-92.45931,35.078196,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.661257606490872,"count":1479},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Conway, AR"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/university-of-central-arkansas/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"df39b882-f7f5-406b-adc4-e84c8ba435c8","content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":true,"isPremium":false,"name":"University of Michigan - Dearborn","type":"College","url":"university-of-michigan---dearborn"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.6471},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":11322},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"1100-1300"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Sophomore","body":"It's got the academic quality of Ann Arbor without having to be bled dry money-wise but because it's designed as a commuter campus, it takes real effort to be involved in student life like clubs or extracurriculars.

I attended undergrad at a much smaller university in a rural area but the transition to graduate school here has been relatively simple.  I love the closed campus and for me with night classes, parking is relatively close to the buildings and easily accessed. The professors I've had so far are stellar. Even though the school is bigger, the MAcc program still has smaller classes and the professors really take the time to get to know you and assist you if you need it. The food options on campus are also awesome. Coming from the smaller university where the only options were a cafeteria and one small restaurant, I love having a Chick-fil-A or Subway I can hit up before class.

There's free tutoring if needed\nUNH works with most study abroad programs. It's discovery credit system makes it easy for credits to transfer towards your major. \nFor food It's in the top 1% of USA. There's 3 dining halls as well as shops all around campus. It's unbelievable(trust me on this)\nD1 Aka sports events are crazy.

I found that the professors made themselves available to students who needed extra time outside of classroom time to process materials being taught in class. As a young African American Woman, I was further impressed by not only the diversity of the university's  faculty but also their students. Overall, my experience at CCSU was positive.

Although the tuition is high, their financial aid packages cover a lot of the costs. The campus is tiny, but it is nice. Some people have noisy neighbors in the dorms, as I did. They would scream karaoke at 3 am. Our school has \"quiet hours\" set in place, but they didn't always listen. The dorms have no air conditioning so my dorm was always hot. This could just be Assumption Hall. The food is always hit or miss. The Cafe sometimes tries to make fancy meals, but they come out bland. Other times they offer hand rolled sushi and it is delicious. The food is definitely overpriced as well. Lastly, the teachers.

I also enjoy how incoming freshman are able o have cars on campus, it's a big help to be able to get home more often. There are a few things that Northern Michigan University could improve on. The parking situation is one of them, although they have added multiple lots to help the problem. Another item that could be better is the dining areas.

There is a YMCA on campus as well, with a student center located inside!\nThe location of Union Station also provides an excellent mean of public transportation instead of having to drive to campus every day. But because this is a commuter campus, if you want to do sports, you have to either do them at the YMCA on campus or go to the Seattle campus. \nThe dormitories are a little small, but they house all the students they can.

It is small but a safe campus that makes you feel at home.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2018-05-24T19:41:51.065033Z","guid":"de6d79e5-f0aa-4234-ac56-eaaa0751d1e7","rating":5},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":3}],"photos":{"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-87.67666,37.966188,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-87.67666,37.966188,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.65807962529274,"count":854},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Evansville, IN"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/university-of-southern-indiana/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"7022462c-523e-4bae-be82-c22da11dae8a","content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"Kent State University","type":"College","url":"kent-state-university"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.8536},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":18180},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"950-1160"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Sophomore","body":"I love Kent State! Having just finished my first year at this amazing university I believe I am able to give a reasonable review. Starting with the pros, Kent State has an amazing resource system. ANYTHING you need, Kent State has or can point you in the right direction of someone who has it or how you can even start it yourself. Kent State has amazing faculty and staff that I believe are truly there to help you. From custodians to our president, I have had nothing but great experiences. Our sports/recreational teams and facilities are top tear or currently being renovated to get there. Kent State is always improving and trying to be the best. Cons, being that it is such a huge university parking can be a hassle and the walking can be tiresome. There is a wide range of people there so of course a few aren't going to be the most pleasant. All in all I truly enjoy Kent State and cannot wait to further my education here!","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2018-06-01T17:49:42.813234Z","guid":"39f3ef2a-d3d1-494b-aa89-597fc41c0276","rating":5},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":3}],"photos":{"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-81.342253,41.146856,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-81.342253,41.146856,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.588814210273644,"count":4166},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Kent, OH"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/kent-state-university/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"4298b6e8-d477-411e-b47d-b47c88ce99fa","content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"California State University - Channel Islands","type":"College","url":"california-state-university---channel-islands"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.7384},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":14461},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"850-1060"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Senior","body":"I am a senior and will be graduating CSUCI in 2018, but I can not leave without giving my honest review about the campus itself. It a great campus, great location and great environment! Most all professors teaching at CI are warm hearted, especially all science professors. I give it 4 stars because I feel that advising and counseling could improve, its what most students complain about. It is a communter school, but there are many students and professors that will have the same interest or have great advice to help you throughout your undergrad.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2017-12-28T22:14:45.022032Z","guid":"25b7f654-c678-4f49-ac3f-098a0b39467c","rating":4},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":2.66}],"photos":{"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-119.04356,34.162949,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-119.04356,34.162949,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.493243243243243,"count":888},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Camarillo, CA"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/california-state-university---channel-islands/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"29847b65-b92f-4a67-84af-078741efc935","content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"University of Montana","type":"College","url":"university-of-montana"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.9243},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":13894},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"950-1200"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Sophomore","body":"The main reason I love going to school here is simply the location and all of the outdoor activities around.

There is also a great music scene with venues like the Wilma, Tophat, Kettlehouse Ampitheater, as well as many others. the campus is beautiful during all four seasons and their are plenty of things to do right here on campus.
