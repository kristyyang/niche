Let me be clear - if you want a huge state school where you can walk into the cafeteria and no one will recognize you, Averett is not for you. But if you want to speak to almost everyone you pass on your way to class, have professors who take time to get to know you and will ask if y'all can catch up after you graduate, have the opportunity to take on leadership roles in your extra curricular activities, and become a part of a FAMILY, Averett should be your number one choice.\n\nThe professors and advisors are phenomenal. If you're wondering just how close of a relationship you make with the staff at Averett - my advisor has a picture of us hanging in her office from my senior pinning, and when going through a hard time in a leadership role, the president wrote me an encouraging handwritten letter. The relationships you make with the staff are exceptional.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2018-02-24T06:03:41.889373Z","guid":"12269862-28ce-48f8-88ec-2ccbae4a7cd1","rating":5},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":2.33}],"photos":{"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-79.413214,36.577273,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-79.413214,36.577273,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.473015873015873,"count":315},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Danville, VA"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/averett-university/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"2acb74fa-6772-4d5e-b8e0-e3db5fb033e1","content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"Bluefield College","type":"College","url":"bluefield-college"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.8481},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":21269},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"790-1010"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Sophomore","body":"I absolutely love Bluefield College.

Another thing I like about it is, they offer a bridge program with the University of Kansas so you can take classes there at a cheaper price than actually going to KU.

I understand prohibiting cell phones in class. I do not understand prohibiting tablets or laptops, even if you're using them to take notes. Luckily I have accommodations to take notes electronically--otherwise, I'd be up a certain creek without a paddle. Most high schools use iPads or some other tablet/laptop now, in the classroom, so students coming in are obviously used to that; why prohibit it now? Anyway, the courses I took were great. Their quality was more or less impeccable. Class sizes are GREAT--usually 20-30. As to variety...their catalog says that French and German classes are available, but they're actually not, because they don't have anyone to teach them; as a result, the only available foreign language course is Spanish. I am tired of Spanish being the only language both offered and/or required in all schools, not just college.

My fellow peers were friendly and made me feel as if we spent the last four years of high school together, although I had just met most of them. I found out that there were so many different resources available to make learning easy and affordable that I did not know of. The staff was very courteous, and gave me a wealth of information. I will refer The University of South Carolina - Lancaster  to any college student as well as rising college students.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2018-05-22T00:48:18.141656Z","guid":"5593fd10-7c40-45d8-94a6-c65d250dda3b","rating":5},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":3.33}],"photos":{"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-80.787268,34.736535,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-80.787268,34.736535,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.9551282051282053,"count":156},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"2 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Lancaster, SC"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/university-of-south-carolina---lancaster/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"5f1ac51e-b8b2-4bc1-bcd3-727e13168e54","content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"Washington Adventist University","type":"College","url":"washington-adventist-university"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.3337},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":19420},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"720-1000"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Freshman","body":"I am a first year transfer nursing student working on bachelors degree.
