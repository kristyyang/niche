The location is one-of-a kind and the education is top-notch.  SNC professors are brilliant and all have professional experience in their field of choice.  Getting internships and job opportunities is extremely easy, especially by networking through the connections the school already has.  Scholarships make this school very affordable.

The professors are invested not only in the students' education, but they care for their students' overall well-being. While there are a lot of areas that could use improvement, my experience has been very good. BMC is a very unique place where students are challenged to grow in wisdom and knowledge, but more importantly to grow in the grace and knowledge of our Lord.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2017-11-22T16:46:09.150237Z","guid":"ada587f3-d526-4b3d-8f8f-8e172d9d2af7","rating":4},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":2.66}],"photos":{"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-89.02924,34.67209,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-89.02924,34.67209,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.775,"count":160},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Blue Mountain, MS"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/blue-mountain-college/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"2d2e6f52-78ae-43b6-92d7-27a9c5ce0367","content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"Williams Baptist College","type":"College","url":"williams-baptist-college"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.6051},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":16615},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"830-1010"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Freshman","body":"Williams Baptist College is a great college.

From the amazing professors who are available to help students one on one to the athletic diversity that makes cheering and supporting so much more fun, Williams has helped me adjust from high school to college with no trouble.

For undergraduate science students, research opportunities are incredibly accessible which is not common at large universities. I am only a freshman and already know the chair of my department well and plan to join her research team sophomore year. There are also many hospitals and medical facilities in the area where students can get volunteer hours. One thing about this school that is a positive aspect for me, but not everyone, is the lack of a large party scene.

Teachers organize movie nights, talent shows, bowling, and much more. Silver Lake College is a small campus, it was what I was looking for. I was looking for a small college because professors sit with you one on one and there are more opportunities for them to help you and that's what Silver Lake professors do. Within the college there are also sports and other school activities. I have recently joined  the cheer team and I really enjoy participating. So Far Silver Lake College has been a great experience for me.

For UTSA being a relitavley new school, it has established itself well in the Alamo city with its engaging Fiesta events such as Best Fest during the spring semester. I love how transparent Roadrunner’s are and how we are always willing to lend a hand to a friend in need. The parking situation can be a bit tedious at times, but besides that, UTSA has been a wonderful college experience so far!","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2018-03-29T00:16:07.126026Z","guid":"a0a82b20-2a48-40d3-9a02-7826063f6b12","rating":4},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":3}],"photos":{"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-98.621386,29.582418,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-98.621386,29.582418,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.6568002041337078,"count":3919},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"San Antonio, TX"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/university-of-texas---san-antonio/#scatterplot"}}]}
