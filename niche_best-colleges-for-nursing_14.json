While working on my associates degree, I was able to take classes that easily transferred over to fulfill my bachelors degree requirements. This was very helpful to me because I didn't want to be put back in the 4 year college track. Saint Xavier also offers many scholarships and makes it very easy to set up a non interest payment plan throughout the year. What I would change about the school is that I would offer a greater variety of courses. I would also enjoy having more lounge space in the hallways since many of the students and myself are commuters. Furthermore, I would recommend the school to invest in finding a way to add more parking space because parking is always filled and very hard to find. Overall, I really enjoy the atmosphere and the small school setting, because the professors, students, and alumni are very welcoming and kind.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2017-10-12T19:26:36.229331Z","guid":"9b6614dd-2dbe-493c-ae0f-33d84487500c","rating":4},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":2.66}],"photos":{"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-87.713507,41.707763,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-87.713507,41.707763,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.5204819277108435,"count":830},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Chicago, IL"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/saint-xavier-university/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"c2c8b653-06b8-4df0-bd10-ce8d530aa45c","content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"Le Moyne College","type":"College","url":"le-moyne-college"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.6531},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":23361},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"1000-1210"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Senior","body":"Le Moyne College is a small campus and offers small classes that I found very helpful and useful. Larger university classes weren’t for me, so Le Moyne was a perfect fit. The professors here actually get to know you and help you whenever needed, offering office hours and meetings by appointments. Le Moyne’s core curriculum requires all students of all majors to take different liberal arts classes, which I think is helpful for students who were unsure of their major starting out. The Jesuit education provided by Le Moyne is thorough and all around excellent. I also commuted to Le Moyne and I found that my professors were always understanding and accomodating if I were ever in the situation where I wouldn’t be able to attend class, such as weather conditions and other external forces that I wouldn’t be able to control. My experience at Le Moyne has been pleasant since day one, and I’m proud to be a soon-to-be graduate from this college.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2017-11-21T17:09:42.782005Z","guid":"cb2d8c6a-ef7d-4c92-be14-586f42c94485","rating":5},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":3}],"photos":{"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-76.088449,43.047316,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-76.088449,43.047316,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.5357142857142856,"count":532},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Syracuse, NY"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/le-moyne-college/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"b21a90df-109d-4ced-ae82-7df91c120f2f","content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"University of West Florida","type":"College","url":"university-of-west-florida"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.4083},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":11175},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"950-1130"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Senior","body":"In my humble opinion based upon my experience, the University of West Florida may not be the best school to attend, but it is one of the best schools to attend within the state of Florida that provides enough of a return on your investment to count. Class sizes are normally small enough that professors can talk to and interact with students on a one-on-one basis to answer questions, to provide assistance, to facilitate conversation, and to even assist with opportunities. With more than seventy individual majors and the opportunities to earn multiple majors, students definitely have not only variety but choice to maximize the opportunities afforded to them to achieve their dreams. The Office of Undergraduate Research has been instrumental in allowing students to travel, to present research, and network, and students are often more than prepared to attend graduate schools and to fill the vacant job and/or leadership positions available after college.

If you are looking to engage in learning and thinking in new ways, put in hard work, and still meet diverse individuals who are goal-oriented but still love to have a good time, then look no further than CUI.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2017-12-29T19:05:25.931001Z","guid":"e22841f4-4ff3-4b37-a84a-3dcf651afd1b","rating":4},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":3}],"photos":{"default":{"crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/5d45d9821ff07bdbeca64e9500947cb765d4ad1d.jpg","MobileHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/5c0ae27c8675dbb6509a26b637f5d0cbfa4b80b6.jpg"},"licenseName":"UNLICENSED"},"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-117.81063,33.6535,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-117.81063,33.6535,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.7743506493506493,"count":616},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Irvine, CA"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/concordia-university-irvine/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"8f83ef77-04b7-4d20-9267-e2739ca2f84f","content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"Stockton University","type":"College","url":"stockton-university"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.7694},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":14367},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"960-1160"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Senior","body":"From day one, as a transfer student Stockton won me over with its incredibly genuine, warm, caring staff. On orientation day the staff made me feel so welcome, everyone was so friendly, and not because they had to be, it was truly genuine! The actual DEAN of my department spent over an hour with me helping to map out my first semester by going over different course selections available for me, helping to make sure I didn't waste time or money picking classes that would not benefit my intended major. The academics are challenging and many employers see Stockton University as a highly credited institution to graduate from. I highly recommend any student looking for a college where they will easily fit in and belong. There are so many activities to keep busy and because Stockton is situated in the heart of South Jersey, its relatively close to anything you could need.

Greek life on this campus to me is one of the best in the country and one of the most wonderful organizations I've had the opportunity to be apart of. It not only provides an inclusiveness towards other organizations and the campus as a whole, but encourages students to work harder in both academia and community service. Along with Greek life this university has also provided many leadership opportunities that I wouldn't have had, had I gone somewhere else. While diversity on this campus tends to be lacking I was able to work with different multicultural organizations to change that aspect.

There are plenty of options all around campus even for people who are vegan or gluten free.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2018-01-04T18:05:31.645922Z","guid":"75dbd13a-b2cb-48d5-9a39-bdfc151c0ea1","rating":5},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":3}],"photos":{"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-73.467342,44.691103,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-73.467342,44.691103,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.526315789473684,"count":665},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Plattsburgh, NY"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/suny-plattsburgh/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"4409efae-4aad-4944-929a-38872dac64a3","content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":true,"isPremium":false,"name":"Hartwick College","type":"College","url":"hartwick-college"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.81},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":25421},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"900-1090"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Freshman","body":"Hartwick is such a great school!

There is a YMCA on campus as well, with a student center located inside!\nThe location of Union Station also provides an excellent mean of public transportation instead of having to drive to campus every day. But because this is a commuter campus, if you want to do sports, you have to either do them at the YMCA on campus or go to the Seattle campus. \nThe dormitories are a little small, but they house all the students they can. Due to the lesser amount of student housing, there is not much partying that happens on campus.

Each class contains information that you can take with you as you build a career and, someday, a family of your own.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2018-05-06T06:00:44.066133Z","guid":"f0b6aa20-86d5-40a8-89c8-9a3ab7fd3489","rating":4},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":3}],"photos":{"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-111.784728,43.815384,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-111.784728,43.815384,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.8261028738788214,"count":5463},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Rexburg, ID"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/brigham-young-university---idaho/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"05d8847c-ce7c-4664-a00c-630a21779358","content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"Penn State Worthington Scranton","type":"College","url":"penn-state-worthington-scranton"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.797},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":12961},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"840-1070"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Sophomore","body":"Penn State Worthington Scranton offers an affordable big degree. By that I mean on your diploma it reads Pennsylvania State University not Penn State Worthington Scranton. We are all one! You obtain a Penn State degree without the horror of enormous financial debt after graduating. My favorite thing about my campus is the great growing diversity of clubs and activities to be involved in. For example Campus Activities Board puts on a karaoke night, stuff a plush, coffee house, game shows, and so much more. This helps to balance academics with relaxing and having fun with fellow students. As well as offering fun activities there are also educational activities that are held on campus such as Chinese New Year Celebration, How to Write a Resume and Interview Like a Pro, etc... overall, Penn State Worthington Scranton provides a wonderful and cultural experience at an affordable cost which in the end yields a stupendous degree!","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2018-03-05T13:51:57.689775Z","guid":"68fa20d1-11eb-40b6-b91f-36d18a317227","rating":5},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":3}],"photos":{"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-75.620583,41.440258,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-75.620583,41.440258,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.234567901234568,"count":81},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Dunmore, PA"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/penn-state-worthington-scranton/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"7ca4892c-7c49-40fd-a8f0-1d6903697f3f","content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"Saint Mary's University of Minnesota","type":"College","url":"saint-marys-university-of-minnesota"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.7924},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":21280},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"900-1110"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Freshman","body":"Saint Mary's is an amazing community to learn in. Everyone will take the time to learn about you and why you are here. All the Professors teach because they are passionate about their students, not because they are looking to benefit themselves. The classes are small and personal, and soon everyone will become a familiar face on campus! Great facilities and housing as well. Winona is a great city with lots of things to do indoors and out.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2018-01-31T00:33:01.521062Z","guid":"0879f4e0-27f1-431a-a3bf-d34ac8c8d6b4","rating":5},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":3}],"photos":{"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-91.696652,44.045322,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-91.696652,44.045322,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.4763092269326683,"count":401},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Winona, MN"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/saint-marys-university-of-minnesota/#scatterplot"}}]}
