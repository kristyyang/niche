After visiting Simpson, Drake, and other private Midwest four year institutions I must say that Creighton's Campus just felt like home.  The professors are all supportive and with a small student to teacher ratio, I feel like an actual person in their classes and can build a relationship with the professors.  The food is excellent, Godfather's Pizza, Chinese, Latin American, Sushi, Burgers, and buffet styled mess halls are a good indication of the different food at Creighton.  The dorms are a little on the dated side, yet they have modern amenities.  The older buildings really gives the place a theme and a warm glow.  Everything is nice and compact seeing that this campus is in the middle of Omaha and all of my classes are within 10-15 minutes of one another.  The advisors are always courteous and listen to the students needs and wants.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2018-05-31T18:36:22.198929Z","guid":"7cb7e8b5-ca43-4732-8bc5-2aa9bae9ad48","rating":4},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":3.66}],"photos":{"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-95.947029,41.265325,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-95.947029,41.265325,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.591194968553459,"count":954},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Omaha, NE"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/creighton-university/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"bbb471e1-f21d-4278-83a4-c97222ee902d","badge":{"display":"Best Colleges for Chemistry in America","ordinal":52,"total":256,"vanityURL":"best-colleges-for-chemistry"},"content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"Macalester College","type":"College","url":"macalester-college"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.371},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":28528},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"1260-1490"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Freshman","body":"Love this place! My favorite thing about this place is that the people and professors really care about you. It goes both ways. If you come here looking for an education you won't just learn more about the subjects you study, you'll learn to think for yourself, and create real-world solutions to the issues that face society today. Mac is a very activism-orientated environment. That means that no matter what they are doing, the people and profs are passionate about their areas. Not for everyone - just for the people who want to change the world.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2017-12-31T07:20:22.264195Z","guid":"05c1bf63-f01f-4f28-a172-b455f36370e8","rating":5},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":4.33}],"photos":{"default":{"author":"mulad ","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/cd64aeb72019cecb4dc9f4c36fcda7a18b2ea11b.jpg","MobileHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/f7af294df292da8c8e91080b14b4269c6ad55a30.jpg","Thumbnail":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/fdd99b9863999e773b670fd38f12c2cf17df4974"},"licenseName":"CC BY ","licenseUrl":"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/2.0/","sourceUrl":"https://www.flickr.com/photos/mulad/3237562307/"},"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-93.169855,44.936709,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-93.169855,44.936709,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.7049608355091386,"count":383},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Saint Paul, MN"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/macalester-college/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"10591a8d-619b-4c83-8026-cf6efcd12d36","badge":{"display":"Best Colleges for Chemistry in America","ordinal":53,"total":256,"vanityURL":"best-colleges-for-chemistry"},"content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":true,"isPremium":false,"name":"Smith College","type":"College","url":"smith-college"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.3723},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":24258},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"1240-1470"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Sophomore","body":"I am a sophomore transfer student at Smith and I have loved my experience so far. The classes are wonderful and the professors are always helpful and caring. I feel challenged but not completely overwhelmed, even while competing as a student-athlete. The food here is good enough for dorm food. As long as you don't expect gourmet meals, you should be fine. Smith tries very hard to cater to vegan/vegetarians/allergies, but they could do more, especially for gluten allergies. Because I am so busy, I am not much of a partier, so it's a positive for me that Smith is not a party school. From what I have heard, the parties are very tame here, which is not for everyone! \nNorthampton is a cute little town that has just enough to keep me from being bored. The only downside is that the stores and restaurants are all quite expensive.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2017-10-25T13:28:31.461474Z","guid":"cb938965-a581-4e64-ad7f-be85365cb890","rating":5},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":4.33}],"photos":{"default":{"author":"redjar","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/c44d3254a840702e801402bd636d49e55441d51d.jpg","MobileHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/73ccf5c0dfdddaa61d9a8f1d81fdd4596457c0b3.jpg","Thumbnail":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/2d22a0ed441c82d8648f042e0ab772eedaccec5a"},"licenseName":"CC BY-SA","licenseUrl":"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/","sourceUrl":"https://www.flickr.com/photos/redjar/112893078/"},"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-72.638094,42.317933,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-72.638094,42.317933,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.6840236686390533,"count":845},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Northampton, MA"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/smith-college/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"c3ea35a9-85d8-473b-a511-4f7d71c3b78e","badge":{"display":"Best Colleges for Chemistry in America","ordinal":54,"total":256,"vanityURL":"best-colleges-for-chemistry"},"content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":true,"isPremium":false,"name":"North Carolina State University","type":"College","url":"north-carolina-state-university"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.4751},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":13066},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"1170-1350"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Junior","body":"One thing that I love about North Carolina State University is the amount of diversity and school pride here on campus.

I think NCSU has one of the best engineering and communication programs here on campus and they also have a lot of resources at our libraries and everywhere else on campus. Their database is incredible and the library has so much information for you to refer to when doing research or completing an essay. This University has a strong reputation of academic success as well competitive students, which is makes our school very exciting. Each student is engaged and passionate about something and NC State encourages that each student pursue those goals.

A lot of opportunities for internships, leadership positions and involvement. A lot of research opportunities and very good professors as well, especially for a public university. Despite the perception, OU is a lot more than just football and greek life. However, I would recommend that after freshman year, you live somewhere within walking distance to campus, because the parking here is absolutely awful and you will absolutely regret commuting to campus and spending nearly 2 hours looking for a parking spot everyday, even with a parking pass that costs hundreds of dollars. Also Dale Hall is a ridiculous building and if you have a class there, get there early because trying to make your way through the crowds in that building can sometimes take a while. The parking situation & Dale Hall is the only thing preventing me from giving this great school 5 stars.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2017-11-06T00:20:34.290457Z","guid":"75f25a4a-6e57-4df8-b0a2-0b3897295b1c","rating":4},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":4}],"photos":{"default":{"crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/6a7d7e2d5c708a009e6b4857db0d69cf2efb39c4.jpg","MobileHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/eeb1688e862a426894b97137be0e4145307a7a24.jpg","Thumbnail":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/0dfb8859200ebd86bfb0acaf4b7740bcc6822455"},"licenseName":"UNLICENSED"},"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-97.445692,35.208152,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-97.445692,35.208152,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.7810136157337366,"count":2644},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Norman, OK"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/university-of-oklahoma/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"9d9a9977-4c96-45c6-8a12-b8be71a34936","badge":{"display":"Best Colleges for Chemistry in America","ordinal":63,"total":256,"vanityURL":"best-colleges-for-chemistry"},"content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"Brigham Young University","type":"College","url":"brigham-young-university"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.5118},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":12864},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"1160-1380"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Freshman","body":"The school is definitely difficult but very rewarding.

All instruments are represented and you won't feel extreme pressure like you would for smaller ensembles.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2018-04-24T20:17:50.936072Z","guid":"0054fe78-eecc-424e-8e10-10103c75dbc3","rating":4},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":4.33}],"photos":{"default":{"crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/cfba010af8f7961d2fa9d333907e9304995d5826.jpg","MobileHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/0556c30bb788fe8071c3cda4085f7416d2f83393.jpg","Thumbnail":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/62d957295f2e31a47657e17bf6d88864e5b215cf"},"licenseName":"UNLICENSED"},"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-76.319037,40.048045,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-76.319037,40.048045,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.6297709923664123,"count":786},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Lancaster, PA"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/franklin--and--marshall-college/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"0b914389-d868-4ecf-970e-60ac8353dde1","badge":{"display":"Best Colleges for Chemistry in America","ordinal":70,"total":256,"vanityURL":"best-colleges-for-chemistry"},"content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":true,"isPremium":false,"name":"University of South Carolina","type":"College","url":"university-of-south-carolina"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.6814},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":19913},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"1120-1300"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Freshman","body":"I am an out of state student attending USC for the first year of pursuing a 4 year degree. In the beginning I was uncomfortable with my transition and unable to feel at home. Through clubs and sports teams I was able to develop new friendships and life skills that made me feel more at home. There are so many opportunities presented to students at USC that all should take advantage of. One of the most important things that is clearly valued here, is academics. My professors so far have been some of the most passionate people I have met. A favorite course I have taken here has been environmental ethics. I took this course as a philosophy requirement and it inspired me to change my major to environmental studies. The professor and the course material inspired me to make a decision that I will not soon regret. I am more than happy to say that I am a student at USC.

This school allowed me to grow as a person both personally and professionally.\nThis school does have its flaws. It really needs to work on protecting its students against sexual violence.
