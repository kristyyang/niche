Everyone (the students, the professors, the athletics coordinations/coaches) is so friendly, and due to Loyola's size, after the first few weeks of school you can't walk across campus without seeing a close friend! Despite the high acceptance rate, the academics are challenging yet interesting, and therefore worthwhile. Loyola's core curriculum, although intimidating at first, is extremely valuable in ensuring every student's education is well rounded (plus it helps to break up the classes for your major, which certainly helps me to stay focused by doing something different). Overall, I love Loyola, and am so happy with my decision to become a Greyhound!","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2017-06-02T01:10:52.911332Z","guid":"c11c3858-c815-4094-83da-db701acdae14","rating":5},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":3.66}],"photos":{"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-76.623417,39.346044,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-76.623417,39.346044,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.5194123819517316,"count":953},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Baltimore, MD"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/loyola-university-maryland/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"1d82d046-ae89-4750-92ef-06f75376f8b3","content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"Mercer University","type":"College","url":"mercer-university"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.6935},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":20692},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"1100-1290"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Senior","body":"Mercer University is a great school overall. The people here made me feel so welcome, and I truly felt like part of a family during my 3 years as a student. Most of the professors are incredible people; I could tell they wanted to see me do well. Because of the small class sizes, it is really easy to build relationships with your professors and get to know other students. For me, this really helped to ensure my success in classes. In addition, there are lots of organizations and volunteer opportunities on campus to help students get involved in the community and feel at home. The campus is absolutely beautiful! However, housing isn't the greatest; some of the dorms are rather old. A few dorms are new or have been renovated recently, so those offer a better living situation. Also, there aren't many food options on campus, and I rarely visited some, as the food was inedible. The meal plans they offer are ridiculous and are not at all worth the money you are asked to spend.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2018-05-16T15:00:30.995265Z","guid":"d47ebb91-ecd3-4e3c-be64-d26c66817072","rating":4},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":3.66}],"photos":{"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-83.651042,32.829731,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-83.651042,32.829731,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.582269503546099,"count":1410},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Macon, GA"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/mercer-university/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"932ef223-8e6f-4518-b89d-4c2071b4b016","content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"Virginia State University","type":"College","url":"virginia-state-university"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.9448},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":15266},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"730-900"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Sophomore","body":"Transferring to Virginia State University has been a blessing.

After visiting Simpson, Drake, and other private Midwest four year institutions I must say that Creighton's Campus just felt like home.  The professors are all supportive and with a small student to teacher ratio, I feel like an actual person in their classes and can build a relationship with the professors.  The food is excellent, Godfather's Pizza, Chinese, Latin American, Sushi, Burgers, and buffet styled mess halls are a good indication of the different food at Creighton.  The dorms are a little on the dated side, yet they have modern amenities.  The older buildings really gives the place a theme and a warm glow.  Everything is nice and compact seeing that this campus is in the middle of Omaha and all of my classes are within 10-15 minutes of one another.

I didn't have any outstanding reason for picking Longwood, but I'm glad I did and I wouldn't pick any other college, go Lancers!","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2016-12-30T16:15:24.644149Z","guid":"2139168f-6755-4d2e-9ef6-63961e2f701b","rating":4},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":3}],"photos":{"default":{"crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/bffb4ff8b5c5f26fba87d4953382e15ae7ed6883.jpg","MobileHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/101440619de72036636c567864ad0f1d238a1af7.jpg"},"licenseName":"UNLICENSED"},"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-78.395789,37.301073,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-78.395789,37.301073,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.512596899224806,"count":1032},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Farmville, VA"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/longwood-university/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"0c0a67b1-b841-4f0d-aa40-c61a7ac8ba0f","content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":true,"isPremium":true,"name":"Biola University","type":"College","url":"biola-university"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.6485},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":32273},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"950-1220"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Freshman","body":"Biola is a great place to learn and become a better leader for Christ.

Being in Providence means there is always something to do or new to try. While it may not be the safest city, campus security helps make PC feel like it is in its own \"bubble\". Even though the food is not the best on campus, do not feel discouraged because the food off campus is always a hit! Dorms are mostly average, some are great while some of the older buildings definitely need renovation. Athletics are a big plus to this school whether you will be playing or in the audience. The school is strongly affiliated with the Catholic faith, however, all of the professors and Dominican Friars will be welcoming of all religious backgrounds. Also, PC may be lacking in diversity but I can tell they are trying to be more inclusive, especially when it comes to clubs and organizations. Overall, a great (and expensive) school.

While the Diocese of Scranton retained ownership of the University, it was administered by the Lasallian Christian Brothers from 1888 to 1942.[4] In 1942, the Society of Jesus took ownership and control of the University.[5] During the 1960s, the University became an independent institution under a lay Board of Trustees.
