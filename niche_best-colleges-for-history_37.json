Queens is a very small campus, it'll take you 5 minutes to walk to the farthest part on campus! The student body closely resembles that of the size of a high school (2,500-3,000) students. Queens is also a liberal arts school so here we focus a lot on the arts and you are required to take some arts courses because of this, but I loved it; it broadened my knowledge and forced me to take courses that I may not have taken otherwise. Because of the size of the school the ratio of professor to student is along the lines of 1:17, which is great because you are NOT known as just a number here, you are an individual that the Professor actually gets to know. It makes your experience better when you know that your Professor cares about you. If you enjoy truly being known on campus, small school/classes then Queens is the perfect fit for you!","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2017-03-27T23:30:42.679889Z","guid":"a05c4c87-4b5d-4d91-9c11-812f8209a19c","rating":4},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":3}],"photos":{"default":{"crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/4fcc168cf25c5c1ce850a03e16eb34c08a05786f.jpg","MobileHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/ddfa9942ddbe15172598d426c373c5f431b04ca4.jpg"},"licenseName":"UNLICENSED"},"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-80.832227,35.188929,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-80.832227,35.188929,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.579520697167756,"count":459},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Charlotte, NC"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/queens-university-of-charlotte/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"28ba6411-175a-45b7-b26f-21c30df06a2e","content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":true,"isPremium":false,"name":"Wesley College","type":"College","url":"wesley-college"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.6},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":16029},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"740-930"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Sophomore","body":"For those who are used to a small environment Wesley is the place to be.

Though it's 15 miles from I-79, Glenville is relatively close to several metro areas. The academics at Glenville are thorough due to the faculty to student ratio; something you won't get at a major university. Glenville also has very nice facilities for academics and athletics. Glenville has plenty of opportunities to participate in extracurricular activities as well. Tuition at Glenville is comparably cheaper than most accredited colleges and universities. The only real negatives about Glenville is parking, dorms and party scene.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2016-12-25T22:00:44.244684Z","guid":"fe6e30d0-cd3c-47be-b919-8fe7e65509d9","rating":4},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":2}],"photos":{"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-80.833597,38.935341,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-80.833597,38.935341,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.4386617100371746,"count":269},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Glenville, WV"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/glenville-state-college/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"87a850b6-8bcd-4b63-b0be-b2bd09e91bd2","content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"Newberry College","type":"College","url":"newberry-college"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.5965},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":18327},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"830-1040"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"College Sophomore","body":"I love Newberry because it is a small school and community where everybody knows each other and it's not at all overwhelming like a bigger school would be.
