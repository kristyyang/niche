It allows for sociability and an overall increase in personal well-being. \nNot only did I enjoy my time in the gym,  but also in the classroom and on campus. Everyone I have come across on campus has been friendly. I think this is because we  all have a mutual understanding of respect and purpose in being privileged to attend this University. \nWith the diversity, growth and changes being implemented, I look forward to seeing my already great experience become even greater.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2018-05-18T21:21:05.206137Z","guid":"91836a75-ef94-4b84-a842-ff9d17e087d6","rating":5},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":3}],"photos":{"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-115.141153,36.106994,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-115.141153,36.106994,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.5882820784729588,"count":3772},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Las Vegas, NV"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/university-of-nevada---las-vegas/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"7d19ae37-bb2c-4ad8-989f-5fd1cd0c45ce","badge":{"display":"Best Colleges in America","ordinal":190,"total":1644,"vanityURL":"best-colleges"},"content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"Washington State University","type":"College","url":"washington-state-university"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.7204},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":17815},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"930-1165"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Sophomore","body":"I've never seen a school so filled with pride! It's incredible to be a part of a family that is nationwide. I've been on vacation, states away, and have heard the familiar greeting of \"Go Cougs!\" from passing strangers. One of the most significant things I like to boast about is how safe and clean the campus is; schools in big cities just can't compete with those aspects of WSU. And, as a young woman living across the state in a new and unfamiliar environment, I can't appreciate enough how hospitable Pullman and the WSU campus is. I'll always recommend WSU to those looking to attend college, it's truly an amazing place to pursue postsecondary education.

The culture here is very friendly and despite me working part-time here, all my 'customers' are nice and friendly and very patient with New comers! The teachers you meet show that they actually put genuine thought and belief into the subject that they teach, unlike most Highschools you recently get out of.

Class sizes are relatively small the professor to student ratio is about 14:1. Small classes allow students to get he individual help that they might need or want. The educational benefits of YSU are amazing for a same state university. \nAlthough, there are somethings I would like to see change. There are not a lot of students that live on campus, there are only three dorm buildings in total. It almost feels like a commuter school in the sense that there are a lot of students that just go to class and then drive home. Weekends are very quiet and there aren't a lot of parties going on mostly because of the lack of students on campus. But, there is some change happening! YSU is building new apartment building the students can stay in. There are three apartment complexes around campus, University Edge, University Courtyards and they are build The Enclave.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2018-01-24T01:32:35.918307Z","guid":"78d2a013-3d7d-4c4b-9ed7-008f4de5ba5f","rating":4},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":2.66}],"photos":{"default":{"crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/ec6d071a1123c50daa4893e11be6a754c68ade5e.jpg","MobileHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/54a7fa7d83aa7f5def609bf299c699913f1ec09f.jpg"},"licenseName":"UNLICENSED"},"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-80.646515,41.105583,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-80.646515,41.105583,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.4008264462809916,"count":1210},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Youngstown, OH"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/youngstown-state-university/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"d8183760-7ab8-44e9-9f89-e149bf4e942f","badge":{"display":"Best Colleges in America","ordinal":459,"total":1644,"vanityURL":"best-colleges"},"content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"North Carolina A&T State University","type":"College","url":"north-carolina-a-and-t-state-university"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.5364},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":9548},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"850-1010"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Senior","body":"North Carolina A&T was not my first choice, but I am delighted I chose this school.

A very diverse population on campus and so many services I probably don't even know all of them, including free counseling services and free gym.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2018-04-21T06:53:28.589814Z","guid":"a21b1381-f800-42b8-bb03-a1987b72070e","rating":5},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":3.33}],"photos":{"default":{"crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/c01a76bc57e05fbe6c2e76acde0bbd7d5ca15a86.jpg","MobileHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/99ed4f0ef22de7fd74e83ad417ddf6a9b28209a3.jpg"},"licenseName":"UNLICENSED"},"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-88.323493,36.61241,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-88.323493,36.61241,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.7013333333333334,"count":1125},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Murray, KY"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/murray-state-university/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"f46a30c2-802c-4e1d-ac12-4da00c620a52","content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"Prairie View A & M University","type":"College","url":"prairie-view-a--and--m-university"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.8548},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":9813},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"750-940"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Sophomore","body":"My experience at this University was like no other! The campus has a very welcoming spirit to all visitors and incoming freshman. I didn't look at this campus as just the college I was attending, but more or so a family! I wouldn't change my experience at all. I've met some lifelong friends that I can truly say that has my back. Of course there's are going to be a couple of issues here and there with teachers, peers, and financial aid, but overall the experience made a huge and positive impact on my life.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2018-05-24T23:39:19.666584Z","guid":"b3df4999-9b76-4019-a4e5-9cd25c0b8cd0","rating":5},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":2.66}],"photos":{"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-95.992066,30.094591,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-95.992066,30.094591,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.4469515122419585,"count":2083},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Prairie View, TX"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/prairie-view-a--and--m-university/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"dd79308c-7ca1-49de-ad76-6957be74628a","badge":{"display":"Best Colleges in America","ordinal":660,"total":1644,"vanityURL":"best-colleges"},"content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"CUNY Lehman College","type":"College","url":"cuny-lehman-college"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.3248},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":6159},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"910-1080"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Junior","body":"What i like most about Lehman is that there are always great opportunities to move ahead in academics. There are always professors, general staff and faculty that advertise and  support the struggling student. These supports are not limited to academics, but extends all the way to financial struggles as well. Lehman is a great campus, however, there are always improvements to be made. One of the improvements I wish to see in Cuny Lehman is the extension of campus space. There is so much diversity on campus and more buildings that gear toward integrating this diversity would be fantastic!","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2018-01-30T00:56:16.065564Z","guid":"09f9fb71-6b1c-4df2-b86f-8f579c5491ea","rating":4},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":3}],"photos":{"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-73.894627,40.873928,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-73.894627,40.873928,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.5506715506715505,"count":819},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Bronx, NY"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/cuny-lehman-college/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"c80defd8-cb74-4e65-899e-5fd27a339e5e","badge":{"display":"Best Colleges in America","ordinal":249,"total":1644,"vanityURL":"best-colleges"},"content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":true,"isPremium":false,"name":"The New School","type":"College","url":"the-new-school"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.6},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":45504},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"1030-1280"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Freshman","body":"Coming to The New School was the best decision I made. My favorite part of this university is all the learning opportunities it brings. In class, the learning style is so different from anything I had ever seen because we are taught to learn from other people's experiences and by engaging in conversations. Here, we aspire to be very politically and socially aware of different issues going around the world. There are organizations directed to many communities and they are really welcoming. Outside the classroom, those organizations could potentially become your family. The great thing about The New School is that it is very respectful of individuality. If you are a very \"on you own\" person that is respected but if you love being with people and socializing all the time you can find your space too. Also, the facilities are great and it is all located in the heart of New York City making it an amazing campus.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2018-04-04T23:31:36.327016Z","guid":"d81779b6-c8b7-413c-92b0-9fd0004f4d60","rating":5},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":3.66}],"photos":{"default":{"crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/20ff6502e17c54b03c03f44404216637012986ae.jpg","MobileHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/b73cd1410a49caf8011dcafe12dbd53f726eee3e.jpg"},"licenseName":"UNLICENSED"},"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-73.994636,40.735275,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-73.994636,40.735275,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.5483271375464684,"count":538},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"New York, NY"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/the-new-school/#scatterplot"}}]}
