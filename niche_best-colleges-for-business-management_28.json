Gallaudet University is the only deaf University in United States of America that is dedicated fully to deaf and hard of hearing individuals. I love the social space at Gallaudet because of how English and ASL are inclusive, allowing everyone to interact with each other anywhere on campus. In classrooms, I am able to understand all the professors without having to worry about misunderstanding them if I were using an interpreter.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2018-05-18T17:03:14.259383Z","guid":"8aa667fd-4128-474e-a2b9-c38ff5474d19","rating":5},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":3}],"photos":{"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-76.993675,38.907371,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-76.993675,38.907371,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.471014492753623,"count":414},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Washington, DC"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/gallaudet-university/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"fb446f79-3b4c-494d-8166-4d9d809e5f7b","content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"University of South Carolina - Upstate","type":"College","url":"university-of-south-carolina---upstate"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.5463},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":14446},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"860-1040"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Niche User","body":"I graduated with my bachelors from this school, I loved my classes and thought my professors were really great.

You obtain a Penn State degree without the horror of enormous financial debt after graduating. My favorite thing about my campus is the great growing diversity of clubs and activities to be involved in. For example Campus Activities Board puts on a karaoke night, stuff a plush, coffee house, game shows, and so much more. This helps to balance academics with relaxing and having fun with fellow students. As well as offering fun activities there are also educational activities that are held on campus such as Chinese New Year Celebration, How to Write a Resume and Interview Like a Pro, etc... overall, Penn State Worthington Scranton provides a wonderful and cultural experience at an affordable cost which in the end yields a stupendous degree!","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2018-03-05T13:51:57.689775Z","guid":"68fa20d1-11eb-40b6-b91f-36d18a317227","rating":5},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":3}],"photos":{"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-75.620583,41.440258,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-75.620583,41.440258,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.234567901234568,"count":81},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Dunmore, PA"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/penn-state-worthington-scranton/#scatterplot"}}]}
