The Admissions Department is superb - campus visits run smoothly, student ambassadors are friendly and helpful, Admissions Counselors are great and ready to answer any and every question. Campus life is great - first year residences are not too different from any other university BUT the free laundry is a major bonus! Also, free mini fridge/microwave units are available in every room. Printing services are more than adequate - 500 free pages per year (I only used about 200 this year!). Dining services are adequate and they're always looking to improve. Professors are superb - open door policy makes visiting offices much more inviting and professors are so accessible. Classes are informative, relevant, and challenging. Professors will work with you in any way to help you understand information and better yourself as a student.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2017-05-30T20:17:16.312907Z","guid":"e5fd8217-d842-49e2-925d-31e4d3fb8067","rating":5},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":4}],"photos":{"default":{"crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/26b4893272f51e5d291d182138739f8efee4f49f.jpg","MobileHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/210e95dc27dd5bc3c2747890c9feba4ecb98fc85.jpg"},"licenseName":"UNLICENSED"},"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-96.738507,43.525939,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-96.738507,43.525939,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.7058823529411766,"count":391},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Sioux Falls, SD"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/augustana-university/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"51fc5bd3-b8fd-4df6-a8c5-168dec347147","content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":true,"isPremium":false,"name":"Spring Arbor University","type":"College","url":"spring-arbor-university"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.7147},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":18465},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"840-1190"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Junior","body":"Spring Arbor University is the perfect small school. The people here are awesome. If you want a place where you can walk across campus and know 10 out of the 20 people that you just walked past, this is the place for you. The professors care about you and your education, and about what you are doing as a student to further your experience in the classroom. Campus is small, and the closest 'big town' is about ten minutes away, but you can always find things to do and people to do them with if you try hard enough. If you don't think a big school is for you, then SAU might be a good option! Our CORE program does a really good job of getting new students hooked up with a student mentor and a group of fellow classmates from the first day on campus. You get to grow with this group and you might find that some of those people will be your good friends.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2017-01-23T21:51:30.56762Z","guid":"7da6c56d-c755-40aa-ab52-6dfe796b878f","rating":4},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":2.66}],"photos":{"default":{"crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/cfbd055fdf88698a3021c1fb1c275238f3a3cd8d.jpg","MobileHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/04ce8326585f3ef8285079f8ba1d89d66e5fc71f.jpg"},"licenseName":"UNLICENSED"},"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-84.551918,42.206233,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-84.551918,42.206233,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.6422764227642275,"count":738},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Spring Arbor, MI"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/spring-arbor-university/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"1614aa44-01e2-4ffe-8b2b-c614b1fc2fe9","content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"Lesley University","type":"College","url":"lesley-university"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.6373},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":29276},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"960-1160"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Freshman","body":"The things I love most about Lesley is that the students are creative, accepting, empowered, and open-minded.

My only complaint is that they don't have much activities for students.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2018-01-29T15:21:45.534153Z","guid":"d196d0a4-fb64-41f7-a88a-3165d552ca91","rating":4},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade"}],"photos":{"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-64.972866,18.344193,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-64.972866,18.344193,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.368995633187773,"count":458},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Charlotte Amalie, VI"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/university-of-the-virgin-islands/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"49cb8b12-611b-4af2-92df-9c8af20e45fd","content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"Concordia University - Minnesota","type":"College","url":"concordia-university---minnesota"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.5726},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":19499},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"920-1110"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Senior","body":"I take classes entirely online because of my work schedule. using Blackboard for all my courses is very easy to use and if there are any issues, the helpdesk is great support.

Its a close knit school and very friendly csmpus. Academics are very good with small class sizes.  My daughter, who is African American, has made friends of all sorts and is involved in a lot. Sure, it does not have the big school sports scene but the college was top ranked in division two in severals sports. Security seems tight so far and there's a real emphasis on community service. If you want a school where the student will not get lost in a crowd and will get a very good foundation, Rockhurst is an under the radar gem with well respected academics as with most Jesuit colleges. Its not a commuter school even though its in an urban area. Campus is beautiful and not urban looking at all.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2017-08-26T05:03:14.500932Z","guid":"d2dcfbca-2735-4506-a1cb-af03240d0215","rating":5},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":3.66}],"photos":{"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-94.571249,39.030843,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-94.571249,39.030843,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.589080459770115,"count":348},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Kansas City, MO"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/rockhurst-university/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"153cdf09-dd98-4486-ae67-6155b5c7683c","content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"Loras College","type":"College","url":"loras-college"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.9236},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":17958},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"938-1246"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Freshman","body":"I have been here for less than a year but I am already blown away by how much I love the school!
