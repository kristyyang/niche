If I had any complaints about Hamline, they would fall into the residential life category. My dorm is very old and in need of some renovation.

It was a bit intimidating at first, but I quickly got used to the way the school is laid out. As for the classes, they are pretty good. There is a wide range of subjects that are offered, so odds are that you will find the types of classes you are looking for.

He loves the school and the key is to get involved with sports, clubs, volunteering, study groups, and social activities in the dorm. If you are looking for a large college or big time Division I sports, this is probably not your school. However,  if you are looking for a solid school that is on the smaller side with a beautiful campus located in a resort town and personalized attention from professors then you should check out Salve Regina.

You aren't just a number here, and, personally, these connections have helped me grow and recognize my strengths and talents. In return, I have been given so many wonderful opportunities at this school that have truly prepared me for life after graduation. I would recommend Roanoke College in a heartbeat.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2017-11-28T16:42:23.7757Z","guid":"ea476743-e41a-4926-81b0-9a29f34ee366","rating":5},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":3.33}],"photos":{"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-80.056433,37.29686,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-80.056433,37.29686,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.611940298507463,"count":670},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Salem, VA"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/roanoke-college/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"5ac44d87-3d43-47da-9d71-ad8f67450be3","content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"North Greenville University","type":"College","url":"north-greenville-university"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.5912},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":15864},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"910-1310"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Freshman","body":"I absolutely love it here! All of the professors really care about their students, and their success. I love being able to attend chapel every Monday and Wednesday mornings. The food in the cafeteria is alright, but they also have a general store, Papa John's, and an Einsteins Bagels on campus so there are a lot of options. The scenery here is beautiful! I love being able to watch the sun set behind the mountains every night. It is a beautiful little campus that is nice and peaceful, and you get to meet a lot of new and wonderful people.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2017-01-28T06:14:47.121493Z","guid":"fc794952-c206-47fb-b55c-7c9fc9c05309","rating":5},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":3}],"photos":{"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-82.37026,35.069758,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-82.37026,35.069758,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.6914498141263943,"count":538},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Tigerville, SC"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/north-greenville-university/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"288a84cb-18f4-424d-a372-8ff0c7955506","content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"Governors State University","type":"College","url":"governors-state-university"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.413},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":16143},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"855-1070"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Junior","body":"I'm a transfer student into GSU. The academics and professors are great here! The campus is a bit of a maze, but there is always someone around to help you find where you need to be and there are signs everywhere helping you figure out where you are. The athletic program is currently growing, so the school doesn't offer many sports yet but is in the process of adding more and expanding its current programs. There are always events going on through different clubs and organizations on campus. GSU has a diverse population of students in terms of race, religion, and age. Many students are commuters and transfer students because GSU only started accepting freshmen a few years ago.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2018-01-10T23:17:58.674054Z","guid":"5f9a786a-5023-4364-a2d7-07bfa40d8832","rating":4},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade"}],"photos":{"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-87.717012,41.448603,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-87.717012,41.448603,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.3585526315789473,"count":304},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"University Park, IL"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/governors-state-university/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"522b0cb1-dc74-4a5d-bc81-0f45b09544d0","content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":true,"isPremium":false,"name":"Mansfield University of Pennsylvania","type":"College","url":"mansfield-university-of-pennsylvania"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.8752},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":17080},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"860-1060"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Freshman","body":"Manfield University is not just a place to further my education, it is another home.
