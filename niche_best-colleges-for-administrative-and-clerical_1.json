The campus is small and well kept, and the food is decent (for being college cafeteria food). The housing is not exactly state of the art, but it is safe and well-kept. The classes are small, allowing for more personalized attention from professors. The campus is very involved, with plenty of groups and activities for all types of people. While being a non-denominational Christian college that requires some religious courses, the faculty and staff do not ostracize or penalize anyone for choosing another path in life. The only downsides to the college are the location (Kansas has little to do, and small town Kansas has less) and the cost. The private school is fairly expensive to attend. However, all things considered, it is definitely a worthwhile college to look into as an upcoming freshman in college.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2017-05-31T00:55:00.195287Z","guid":"6740e85b-57b2-474c-93c3-84fc02af5020","rating":4},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":2.66}],"photos":{"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-98.209966,38.219783,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-98.209966,38.219783,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.488262910798122,"count":213},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Sterling, KS"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/sterling-college---kansas/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"d2661dbb-1f27-4182-9053-51b4fb5e9060","badge":{"display":"Best Colleges in America","ordinal":529,"total":1644,"vanityURL":"best-colleges"},"content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"Arizona State University - West Campus","type":"College","url":"arizona-state-university---west-campus"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.7786},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":8692},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"960-1168"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Freshman","body":"I really love Arizona State University's West campus.

I can tell they really want me to succeed and be the best that I can. Often, my parents ask me if I made the right decision. I am absolutely sure that I did and I could not be happier to have chosen to attend Howard University.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2018-01-04T23:35:01.904982Z","guid":"f10182e7-25e8-4ab9-b6e1-755380fabb28","rating":5},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":3.33}],"photos":{"default":{"crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/7633545e449854b939174fafc89bf538b3ced8ce.jpg","MobileHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/48d8510e8210ca6e286bee501be568a49f82533e.jpg"},"licenseName":"UNLICENSED"},"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-77.019478,38.920739,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-77.019478,38.920739,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.3921120320091456,"count":3499},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Washington, DC"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/howard-university/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"600dc8dc-eda3-4c9a-9226-e788eba4be46","badge":{"display":"Best Colleges in America","ordinal":521,"total":1644,"vanityURL":"best-colleges"},"content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"SUNY Maritime College","type":"College","url":"suny-maritime-college"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.5804},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":16301},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"1030-1210"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Freshman","body":"The college is an excellent place, I love every second on this campus, yes sometimes the work load can be a lot but there is very good tutoring on campus.

It keeps you in line where as other schools you don't have that type of guidance where someone is always helping you. Another thing I like is that the regiment is very student based so they understand the struggles of the regiment program as well as the work load of the school. The school has amazing job placement coming out of this school; coming from someone who has family history from the school I can definitely back up my statement.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2018-01-25T21:51:31.729035Z","guid":"c18f5ca1-f0e4-41d1-9cee-175a7656a0ab","rating":5},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":3}],"photos":{"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-73.800336,40.809048,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-73.800336,40.809048,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.3125,"count":112},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Throggs Neck, NY"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/suny-maritime-college/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"ffad4faa-e758-4269-bf49-a728cd7e06c7","content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"Claflin University","type":"College","url":"claflin-university"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.4182},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":17241},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"830-950"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Junior","body":"There are many different elements that make Claflin great, but the main one is class sizes and the atmosphere is family-like.

I am taking my experiences working alongside my peers in the school newspaper \"State Press\" and student outreach \"Programming and Activities Board\" to learn valuable work ethics for future career skills. As a medical studies major, I still find it important to surround myself with other activities and involvements that are not related to my major.

Professors at Rowan are also highly skilled, and I have not had a bad one yet!","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2018-05-18T20:18:41.788284Z","guid":"d2273e70-8360-4dea-8208-3daf752f6b7a","rating":4},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":3}],"photos":{"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-75.117974,39.709768,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-75.117974,39.709768,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.404087013843111,"count":1517},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Glassboro, NJ"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/rowan-university/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"d2df8235-fb5d-4a29-8bc1-71eacdfdd1cc","badge":{"display":"Best Colleges in America","ordinal":769,"total":1644,"vanityURL":"best-colleges"},"content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"Canisius College","type":"College","url":"canisius-college"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.7786},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":20767},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"970-1190"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Alum","body":"I loved getting to know my community and make the friends and experience that I did.

You can really feel at home here in a way few schools can make you feel at home. The campus is beautiful and the people are friendly. There's a quaint apple orchard right outside! The welcoming vibe doesn't end when you leave the campus, though. Even in my online classes, I can feel the warmth of professors and classmates that care about me. Being at BYUI is like being part of a family.
