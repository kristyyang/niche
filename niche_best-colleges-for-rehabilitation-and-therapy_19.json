You make good friends that you most likely will have multiple classes with so it makes it easier to study and makes class more fun.

The only down fall is that since they are a Christian school you are required to take quite a few in depth theology classes, regardless of your major. This takes up a lot of time, credits, and money for classes that may not be applicable for some people.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2018-04-29T04:23:56.021839Z","guid":"4c57ecad-4c36-4934-b114-27ec65ed93db","rating":4},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":3.66}],"photos":{"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-122.362923,47.649338,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-122.362923,47.649338,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.67816091954023,"count":957},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Seattle, WA"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/seattle-pacific-university/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"25ef9ec9-c42b-4096-8821-233b57629ed4","content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":true,"isPremium":false,"name":"Barry University","type":"College","url":"barry-university"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.6159},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":21489},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"850-1010"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Alum","body":"I love the small classrooms and the professors are so knowledgeable, experienced, competent, patient, hard working, and understanding.

My best advice for those that are thinking about coming here is that if you thrive in a chill and relaxed environment, then this is a great place for you! The campus is dead most of the times, so if you are looking for a party school do not come here.  Overall I think the university is great for on campus activities, the knowledgable professors and the small classroom sizes.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2018-05-19T18:57:31.166016Z","guid":"ce0e148d-3991-4838-96a5-c765e70a87c3","rating":4},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":2.66}],"photos":{"default":{"crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/3d4e203434169bc3a3125077b2be973409504bc0.jpg","MobileHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/badf7c1f0fb7e98ffbc11258dc12d2d67564face.jpg"},"licenseName":"UNLICENSED"},"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-155.081329,19.701854,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-155.081329,19.701854,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.2812121212121212,"count":825},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Hilo, HI"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/university-of-hawaii-at-hilo/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"374779be-1349-44aa-a218-83ec35822690","content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":true,"isPremium":false,"name":"Regis University","type":"College","url":"regis-university"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.5659},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":26505},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"950-1170"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Sophomore","body":"I absolutely loved Regis the students and faculty there are amazing!
