First, there are a lot of positive aspects about academics. I liked that there were small class sizes, lots of hand-on-experience in classes, no TAs, and you could easily build relationships with professors. Another positive is that the dining hall has an excellent selection of food and is top rated in the country. I liked that there was many ways to get involved on campus such as Greek life, Volunteer work, and other clubs and organizations, as well as athletics. The Rec Center was also extremely nice. Downfalls of Ashland include a lack of parking (and lots of parking tickets), the fact that it is a dry campus, and poor quality in housing/dorms. The dorms are mostly small, old, and many do not have air conditioning.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2018-01-04T20:41:20.901223Z","guid":"94458c53-0abe-47d9-b32a-eb48312e56ad","rating":4},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":3}],"photos":{"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-82.320621,40.860987,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-82.320621,40.860987,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.6349924585218703,"count":663},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Ashland, OH"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/ashland-university/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"ca055bc4-5a5c-4be8-8443-261c64edb677","content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"University of Illinois at Springfield","type":"College","url":"university-of-illinois-at-springfield"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.653},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":11444},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"886-1146"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Freshman","body":"Coming from a small town, this smaller college is perfect for me!

Their graduation rate is 98%, so there is excellent academic programs. I'm personally in the nursing program, both in the BSN and ADN. No other school would let me do both. I'm doing both to allow me to get a year of work experience before graduate school. GW encourages their students to further their education to graduate school. Additionally, GW has huge diversity within the campus. We have many students who live across the world just to come here, a lot of them for sports. Another benefit about going to GW is the security/safety. We have an actual police department on campus that consists of about eight to nine officers on call. Overall GW is one of the best colleges to go to whether you are looking to play sports, all about academics, a safe place away from home, or looking for a new environment!","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2018-03-20T14:56:54.553908Z","guid":"27c35606-55e5-4447-951e-ffe981e71af3","rating":5},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":2.66}],"photos":{"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-81.668141,35.24732,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-81.668141,35.24732,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.604685212298682,"count":683},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Boiling Springs, NC"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/gardner-webb-university/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"60d214cf-c874-4767-aea6-885f123010ef","content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"Minneapolis College of Art & Design","type":"College","url":"minneapolis-college-of-art--and--design"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.6525},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":27169},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"940-1190"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Freshman","body":"Im in my first year here at MCAD, love the school!

Since it is not a huge school you get to know a lot of people and can feel yourself as a part of the campus life in Fitchburg State. Much appreciated are the small changes such as the basketball court and better food. Not going to lie, the surrounding city of Fitchburg is not pretty to look at but if you stay on campus, you'll be fine and enjoy yourself. Campus police takes their job very serious and make sure no one is in danger at all times. Some of the athletes here can be full of themselves but it's very easy to avoid dealing with them (unless their drunk at a party when you have to knock them out). I'd have to say the majors that Fitchburg State is most recognized for are the Exercise and Sport Science, Nursing, Film and Business. The professors here are really cool and all of them are very passionate of what they teach.

The campus is small and well kept, and the food is decent (for being college cafeteria food). The housing is not exactly state of the art, but it is safe and well-kept. The classes are small, allowing for more personalized attention from professors. The campus is very involved, with plenty of groups and activities for all types of people. While being a non-denominational Christian college that requires some religious courses, the faculty and staff do not ostracize or penalize anyone for choosing another path in life. The only downsides to the college are the location (Kansas has little to do, and small town Kansas has less) and the cost. The private school is fairly expensive to attend. However, all things considered, it is definitely a worthwhile college to look into as an upcoming freshman in college.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2017-05-31T00:55:00.195287Z","guid":"6740e85b-57b2-474c-93c3-84fc02af5020","rating":4},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":2.66}],"photos":{"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-98.209966,38.219783,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-98.209966,38.219783,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.488262910798122,"count":213},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Sterling, KS"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/sterling-college---kansas/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"f2226519-b2e0-42e4-8331-5d262bb450e2","content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":true,"isPremium":true,"name":"Alverno College","type":"College","url":"alverno-college"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.75},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":18861},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"770-1050"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Sophomore","body":"I came to Alverno as a transfer student.

The community around Alverno, along with the staff and women who attend this school are amazing and supportive. Alverno does not have grades, we have a pass or fail system. At first it was scary with that grading system,however, I really like it because the professors provide lengthy feedback on every assignment. The feedback tells us what we did well on and how we can improve our skills. With the professors giving indivial feedback, it provides us with a chance to form a better relationship with them rather then being defined by a grade.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2018-05-20T00:20:48.016793Z","guid":"67f3bb79-6cf7-43c0-b21c-942113753f97","rating":5},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":3.33}],"photos":{"default":{"crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/d0bbe0867b2fdaa2c8e63c8b67d2162613d78376.jpg","MobileHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/7571bf3c3309dc594f681e8f29704d68d9ee749f.jpg"},"licenseName":"UNLICENSED"},"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-87.965498,42.983518,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-87.965498,42.983518,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.7812166488794023,"count":937},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Milwaukee, WI"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/alverno-college/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"539a5849-0d39-451a-9c94-8891b0cb8bc5","content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":true,"isPremium":false,"name":"Southwestern Adventist University","type":"College","url":"southwestern-adventist-university"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.4997},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":19947},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"820-1010"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Junior","body":"I have had a great experience in Southwestern Adventist University.

The overall campus lifestyle is great and the people at the college are even better.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2017-02-06T05:29:07.128835Z","guid":"57ed687d-3894-4a6b-bb4b-db6fd14a4218","rating":4},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":2.66}],"photos":{"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-98.373641,40.590448,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-98.373641,40.590448,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.4386973180076628,"count":522},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Hastings, NE"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/hastings-college/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"9a4b8a89-a37a-4460-ab1a-94f3622931d1","content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"University of Indianapolis","type":"College","url":"university-of-indianapolis"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.8617},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":21909},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"890-1120"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Niche User","body":"Great school and even more incredible faculty!
