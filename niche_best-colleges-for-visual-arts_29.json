The professors are really understanding for the most part and they all are very knowledgeable in their department. Also the Bi-Co is a pretty neat program at the school. We could also take classes at Swarthmore and UPenn even though that's more uncommon but if you really want to do it you can. The students can get a little rattled when it comes to politics and it's really liberal, some people like that others don't, just depends on who you talk to. The campus is sooo beautiful all throughout the year! And housing is one the best parts because most of the rooms are really big and you can get a single your sophomore year. The college also does a good job at matching roommates for first years. It can get a little boring because it's in a suburb but Philly close enough that you could go into the city every weekend if you wanted to.

While on campus, many of the staff members will get to know you by name, not as a number. To me, it is really important to recognize students and call them by name, as it makes you feel important.

It's a great campus and a supportive community, for the most part.

Overall the campus is a safe place, but I would like to see better management of the school's more personal cases (such as Title IX cases) and how they protect the survivors after the dust settles. I would also like to suggest starting incoming freshmen out with advisors in their fields of study, if a major has been decided upon. It would make figuring out the requirements for their majors less confusing, than to be switched around so often and risking being able to graduate on time due to lack of credits required.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2018-05-31T19:15:46.749877Z","guid":"24c0b829-00b2-4318-a915-34137ffea789","rating":4},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":2}],"photos":{"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-80.020864,36.926648,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-80.020864,36.926648,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.3839285714285716,"count":336},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Ferrum, VA"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/ferrum-college/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"3d6df1a2-1cd4-45b1-a4c8-af21bcd69a1d","content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"Cumberland University","type":"College","url":"cumberland-university"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.4891},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":20753},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"830-1030"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Freshman","body":"Cumberland University fits perfect for my situation.

The students there are easy to talk to and get involved with, the staff seems to have a genuine care for you and your success, and the professors are all passionate about their work and want to see you succeed.  My only complaint is that the President places so much of his attention on the Nursing and Music programs that the other programs seem to be placed on the back burner.  Otherwise, it is a great school and an amazing experience that I would recommend to anyone!","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2018-05-08T19:40:53.901125Z","guid":"ad251ce4-8136-4593-b155-385bcf68ed89","rating":5},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":2.66}],"photos":{"default":{"crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/c0580677706bd05cb97c93b8cb95f4bc85f285c8.jpg","MobileHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/58f64cbd80c5c2bf0901ee051a4259338a0f508a.jpg"},"licenseName":"UNLICENSED"},"mapbox_header":{"crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-88.128934,30.793247,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-88.128934,30.793247,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"UNLICENSED"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.857677902621723,"count":267},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Mobile, AL"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/university-of-mobile/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"a5fdbf37-fb26-4685-bfd0-494d00dd336e","content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"Shorter University","type":"College","url":"shorter-university"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.6115},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":17447},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"830-1070"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Niche User","body":"The atmosphere!

I have a great schedule that fits how I work. I've got the chance to become friends with a whole lot of people I would not have met usually. Lots of them comes from places miles away which boggles my mind! I have found my classes very interesting and not too difficult, Just gotta keep up on whats going on! The only major problem I have is the mytlu website we use to access lots of things is a little difficult to navigate through when it comes to finding things such as student employment and some things aren't able to be found online such as some events. Other than That I really am enjoying TLU and blessed I even get the chance to attend this amazing university.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2018-01-31T05:32:35.153213Z","guid":"3e285b69-5a49-4321-bf3f-5fa6ab099c5c","rating":4},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":3}],"photos":{"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-97.984601,29.573274,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-97.984601,29.573274,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.603938730853392,"count":457},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Seguin, TX"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/texas-lutheran-university/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"12311f54-37d0-4716-ba9e-683f7efae651","content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":true,"isPremium":false,"name":"Roberts Wesleyan College","type":"College","url":"roberts-wesleyan-college"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.9},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":22681},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"970-1160"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Senior","body":"The higher education experience I received at Roberts was excellent.
