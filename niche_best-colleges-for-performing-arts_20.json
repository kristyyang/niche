While it has a very rigorous academic program, the school also provides a range of resource to choose from if a student is ever in need of help, both academically and otherwise. Despite being an open campus, as a cis-female individual I still feel reasonably safe. The campus is small and beautiful, with the state capital building just across the street. The student body shares a close-knit bond that is perhaps even more so than larger schools, due to the smaller undergrad population. Professors and staff are generally very open, accepting, and easy to approach without fear of judgement. It is a very expensive education, but the majority of students receive some sort of financial aid or scholarship. I'm so glad to be fortunate enough to be able to attend this school.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2018-05-18T20:39:06.20624Z","guid":"0f4d17a5-cf3c-4882-af66-e03a836d4ad0","rating":4},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":3.66}],"photos":{"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-123.030727,44.935743,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-123.030727,44.935743,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.601108033240997,"count":722},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Salem, OR"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/willamette-university/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"ad74490c-c545-420d-80c6-46146daaf5a9","content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"Pacific University","type":"College","url":"pacific-university"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.788},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":30130},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"1010-1230"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Senior","body":"I have loved my time at Pacific University.

The gyms can feel a little old. \n\nThe surrounding area is a little rough and it can be hard to find things to do unless you really seek them out. There are a few really good places like Forage Market and Fuel and some other hidden gems around. There are quite a few good hikes around the area, usually an hour away or so. It's really nice to have a car on campus although parking is tight.\n\nBates is a really great place that does have its downsides as well, like all colleges.

I am excited for the my future career in Physical Therapy, and I know that Eastern University is preparing me well to serve others with physical impairments.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2018-06-03T19:48:00.077831Z","guid":"8cbd73ba-b8e2-43ba-9d1f-69e7fd446a10","rating":4},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":3}],"photos":{"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-75.370268,40.052306,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-75.370268,40.052306,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.5798657718120803,"count":745},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Saint Davids, PA"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/eastern-university/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"1206b8e8-e696-43f2-8d38-8f0ba881fc44","content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"Castleton University","type":"College","url":"castleton-university"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.9532},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":16118},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"860-1068"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Alum","body":"Castleton University is a small school located in central Vermont.

The building's collegiate gothic architectural style is beautiful and well maintained. The food there was wonderful, the campus cafeteria put meticulous effort into preparing each meal. The academic side of university of the south is where they excel. The former graduates of the university are well educated and prepared for their career field. The athletics are less than satisfactory however; because the university is so goal oriented towards educating students. Partying at the university is not great because the students are less focused on social affairs. Overall The University of the South is a perfect place to go to college if your goal and life are built around education. I personally love this school, but if you are the sort of person who enjoys less of the scholar side I would not recommend it to you.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2016-09-28T23:50:25.349506Z","guid":"d0f39dfb-ab1e-4944-8b84-db9b302cc862","rating":4},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":4}],"photos":{"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-85.917772,35.20443,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-85.917772,35.20443,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.650990099009901,"count":404},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Sewanee, TN"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/sewanee---the-university-of-the-south/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"366bd4aa-dc39-43d6-aa81-856a1324f151","content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"Elizabethtown College","type":"College","url":"elizabethtown-college"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.7343},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":28518},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"990-1160"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Niche User","body":"Elizabethtown University is a very friendly place with a thriving community around its borders.

Overall, Meredith proves to be an excellent environment for obtaining your degree!","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2018-01-04T18:12:55.906771Z","guid":"2840e2f7-297b-458c-b687-8bcfaef23729","rating":5},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":3.33}],"photos":{"default":{"crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/8aa59d80e8c3266ee8edc510f321e9405c678f67.jpg","MobileHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/5e6d32caa66ed8349c61e43c954c4a5a6110dd42.jpg"},"licenseName":"UNLICENSED"},"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-78.689175,35.797197,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-78.689175,35.797197,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.852359208523592,"count":657},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Raleigh, NC"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/meredith-college/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"8e8a4f05-ed34-4df2-a9fd-f5ada02d8b23","content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"Whittier College","type":"College","url":"whittier-college"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.6945},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":25638},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"920-1130"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Freshman","body":"I think I made the right choice coming to Whittier.

I didn't think the rules were very strict, but I heard a lot of kids complaining about them.  So you have to come in knowing you are getting a good deal.  Make the most out of the opportunities you are given!","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2018-03-22T00:29:45.460818Z","guid":"c722775b-bd4b-44d4-a912-ed299f3ba445","rating":4},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":3.66}],"photos":{"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-93.238174,36.616019,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-93.238174,36.616019,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.7546583850931676,"count":322},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Point Lookout, MO"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/college-of-the-ozarks/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"768ce7e1-ce27-4258-b2dc-0b6f339427f7","content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":true,"isPremium":false,"name":"Seton Hill University","type":"College","url":"seton-hill-university"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.6087},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":23228},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"900-1150"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Junior","body":"I visited Seton Hill University during my high school senior year.  My visit included overnight lodging, meals, but most importantly inclusion in several classes I was interested in taking.  I decided this was the place I wanted to obtain my degree.  While I spent four semesters at community college, all of my credits transferred to Seton Hill.  My advisers have been very helpful in making decisions to class schedule and career choices.  This is an older campus with great atmosphere.  It was very to transition from community college to university.   I plan on obtaining an Art Education degree and am taking full advantage of a three year old arts building which contains not only art studios, but studios for dance.  I would strongly advise anybody to include Seton Hill University on their must see.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2018-02-22T21:44:17.985189Z","guid":"61726ed2-d54f-47da-97e7-856f49aca3d1","rating":4},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":3}],"photos":{"default":{"crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/b06026905218d3c3ca4053c9029856e9e622f6c7.jpg","MobileHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/b2dec240be13299f7548e035000b823cccb5ee7e.jpg"},"licenseName":"UNLICENSED"},"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-79.556228,40.308623,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-79.556228,40.308623,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.6678966789667897,"count":813},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Greensburg, PA"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/seton-hill-university/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"d33fe5ed-526e-42c7-9f5f-9c58eed4a024","content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":true,"isPremium":true,"name":"Whitman College","type":"College","url":"whitman-college"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.5108},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":34272},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"1200-1420"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Alum","body":"You can do everything at Whitman- academics, leadership, hobbies.
