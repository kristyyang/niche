My major as an occupational therapy assistant narrowed down my search and I ended up finding Central Penn College. I went for a visit and knew it was everything I was looking for it was small, a close knit community, no parties and so much student life! Central Penn was the only college that I applied to which was very risky but I got in!! With the program and the scheduling at Central Penn I will be able to finish in 1.5 years and get right into the work field. I`m so glad to say that I go to Central Penn College! The one thing that frustrates me at the moment is the schedule and the fact that I have to go to school over the summer but when I am working and everyone I graduated with still has 2 years if college it will all pay off!","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2018-02-18T01:22:33.472378Z","guid":"c7cc1280-e5e5-40e5-b2b9-43d5c3b52a5c","rating":5},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":2.33}],"photos":{"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-76.934461,40.3049,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-76.934461,40.3049,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.8642533936651584,"count":221},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Summerdale, PA"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/central-penn-college/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"91b804b4-db9b-4a91-bf94-52ef45c76456","content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"Lincoln Christian University","type":"College","url":"lincoln-christian-university"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.5288},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":20123},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"870-1000"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Graduate Student","body":"Well, I am impressed by the high level of teaching at LCU.

It's a setting designed to help students succeed. The smallness helps to give students more support from professors, faculty and staff and an easier time accessing resources. Town is just minutes away with plenty of things to do and places to go for a night out and away from homework. It provided me the opportunity to play college sports, make lifelong friends and launched me into a career I love just 2.5 months after graduation. Without a doubt the best decision of my life was to attend this college and I owe so much of my success to my alma mater and the faculty/staff who helped encourage, support and challenge me along the way.

My freshmen year, a guy had lost his grandmother and the student government bought him a plane ticket to make it back for the funeral.

The school is evolving and growing with the industry. The teachers are great and know what they're teaching, and are available to help you. The housing is the weakest point about the school.

It is completely possible to challenge yourself academically here. In the science department, the professors are very highly qualified and teach the material very well. The staff here are all incredibly helpful and approachable. Rosemont is a small community where people all around campus know each other. People here genuinely want you to succeed. For undergraduate science students, research opportunities are incredibly accessible which is not common at large universities. I am only a freshman and already know the chair of my department well and plan to join her research team sophomore year. There are also many hospitals and medical facilities in the area where students can get volunteer hours. One thing about this school that is a positive aspect for me, but not everyone, is the lack of a large party scene. Overall, I would recommend Rosemont College to students who want to go to college to learn in a tight knit community.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2016-11-04T03:34:46.742052Z","guid":"7e742024-8989-4d49-bbd8-0ef73ea5d79b","rating":5},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":2}],"photos":{"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-75.329898,40.034771,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-75.329898,40.034771,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.161290322580645,"count":124},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Rosemont, PA"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/rosemont-college/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"09c4ec35-d3d4-4121-8c8c-1fcd91e67f3b","content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"Barclay College","type":"College","url":"barclay-college"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.6667},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":13343},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"800-1170"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Senior","body":"Great experience!

The school has purchased all parking anywhere near the school and parking permits are needed everywhere. I tried to buy a parking permit but there were no more available. So I was forced to walk a mile to classes, and even still had to pay at parking meters. I didn't mind the walk, but sometimes could not find parking. Another thing I didn't appreciate is that there are no places where I could pump my breast milk, since I am a breastfeeding momma.

The campus offers a calm and friendly scene while promoting cultural and international affairs.  The current economic crisis has impacted the students, making them more knowledgeable in politics and economics, while raising new activists who speak up for those who do not have the needed courage.   The curriculums are exquisite for those who want to learn more about social studies and humanities while majoring in medicine, communications, entrepreneurship, and others.  I highly recommend the public University for those who want to learn about Caribbean studies, natural sciences, and linguistics.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2018-05-14T18:16:14.612966Z","guid":"1088835f-b98c-484e-97c2-8e0f61d0a4c0","rating":4},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade"}],"photos":{"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-66.045875,18.403027,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-66.045875,18.403027,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.5181159420289854,"count":552},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1"},{"label":"TaglineFact2"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/university-of-puerto-rico---rio-piedras/#scatterplot"}}]}
