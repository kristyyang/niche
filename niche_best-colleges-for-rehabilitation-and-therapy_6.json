With the small class room sizes, you are able to not develop close relations to your peers, but your professors as well. A professor-student  relationship is crucial not only in the learning process, but even future academic adventures outside of Adrian. The professors are more than willing to sit down with you and break it down, piece by piece. You are not just another nameless face, you are you. Being a liberal arts college, distributions are a requirement. Though they may be an annoyance at first, they become well-rounded student shaping machines. Through these classes, you are able to educate your self of the other perceptions, cultures, and ideas along with the synthesis of your own. Though the social scene is somewhat lacking, Adrian College makes up for it in its application of the Arts and Sciences.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2018-05-02T01:16:08.435687Z","guid":"f0228f49-3de9-4c02-9e74-64b584d68ec4","rating":5},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":2.66}],"photos":{"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-84.059947,41.898449,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-84.059947,41.898449,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.442906574394464,"count":578},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Adrian, MI"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/adrian-college/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"5d99ce6e-0592-4b9e-87c9-e3f185d4735f","badge":{"display":"Best Colleges for Kinesiology and Therapy in America","ordinal":133,"total":378,"vanityURL":"best-colleges-for-physical-therapy"},"content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":true,"isPremium":false,"name":"SUNY Cortland","type":"College","url":"suny-cortland"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.52},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":17422},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"1020-1220"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Senior","body":"SUNY Cortland is an awesome college! I studied sport management and all the professors in my department have real-world experience in the industry which is important.  We have a state of the art fitness center which has anything you can imagine, and probably more. Going to varsity games is fun and the dining halls are decent. If you like to party, youll love Cortland even more. There is always a reason to go out and drink with your friends and the bar scene is legit. If youre not a partier, thats cool too, there is always SO much going on campus youre sure to have fun without drinking. The city itself is a neat, they recently received a 10 million dollar grant to renovate downtown. Huge economy boost. Syracuse's Destiny mall is a half hour away and SUNY Cortland sponsors trips to go there so if you or your friends dont have a car, you’re good. Ithaca is 25 minutes away and is a very cool town, theres trails to hike and its great if you just want to get away from Cortland for the day","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2018-02-08T20:55:20.899402Z","guid":"7edfedbc-29a7-45b9-82ee-3edf1f1d12d4","rating":4},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":2.66}],"photos":{"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-76.197909,42.590158,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-76.197909,42.590158,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.55484693877551,"count":784},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Cortland, NY"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/suny-cortland/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"6d304dec-8ab0-42b9-8c0f-fd1929b33e4a","badge":{"display":"Best Colleges for Kinesiology and Therapy in America","ordinal":134,"total":378,"vanityURL":"best-colleges-for-physical-therapy"},"content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"Indiana University-Purdue University - Indianapolis (IUPUI)","type":"College","url":"indiana-university-purdue-university---indianapolis-iupui"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.7397},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":10538},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"890-1130"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Alum","body":"I loved my time at IUPUI.

Hillsdale is academically challenging, which creates an excellence that allows students to self-govern, and discover how to think.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2017-04-26T21:22:41.395562Z","guid":"4413aa3a-4f1a-43e4-8004-fdb285a665cd","rating":4},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":3.33}],"photos":{"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-84.62,41.89,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-84.62,41.89,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.679640718562874,"count":334},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Hillsdale, MI"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/hillsdale-college/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"f7c82626-39cb-4478-b978-50c7675d093c","badge":{"display":"Best Colleges for Kinesiology and Therapy in America","ordinal":147,"total":378,"vanityURL":"best-colleges-for-physical-therapy"},"content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"Roanoke College","type":"College","url":"roanoke-college"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.7304},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":29999},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"970-1200"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Junior","body":"Great campus... great professors...great curriculum...overall, a great school!

It is a gorgeous campus. It also has an amazing staff who take the time to know you well. It is a Southern Baptist school, so most of the students have more conservative values although they are not insanely conservative and are very open minded to the ideas of other individuals. Samford is also located in a nice area of Birmingham, AL that offers enough fun to try something new every weekend. The area also contains many healthy churches that can enrich your college experience ten-fold.\nThere are some pitfalls. The diversity here is a bit pitiful and the conservative atmosphere of the school may also be suffocating to certain individuals. Parties are fairly few and far between.

It is a great school.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2018-05-16T20:21:32.615213Z","guid":"fe24fd11-ecd6-4f1e-ac2e-6d8a59f147f2","rating":5},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":3}],"photos":{"default":{"crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/177c9d91f2910ea8ba3568c70ec8b58b61342f97.jpg","MobileHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/78639fff777f514d2340bed216fcb006781405a2.jpg"},"licenseName":"UNLICENSED"},"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-97.328511,32.397136,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-97.328511,32.397136,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.861182519280206,"count":389},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Keene, TX"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/southwestern-adventist-university/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"cd508b53-368f-4883-895a-c75b0aaa5fca","badge":{"display":"Best Colleges for Kinesiology and Therapy in America","ordinal":155,"total":378,"vanityURL":"best-colleges-for-physical-therapy"},"content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"SUNY College at Brockport","type":"College","url":"suny-college-at-brockport"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.5533},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":14267},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"920-1120"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Alum","body":"I graduated from The College at Brockport and received a degree in finance. It is absolutely amazing the construction and improvements they have made to their facilities. Over the last several years with tuitions going way up for private schools, many are opting for top notch State schools. Brockport has become one of the best and hardest academic SUNY schools to get into in NY, recently. Many ratings have Brockport as a top 20 or even top 10 SUNY school in NY and their academic standards have passed every other school in the SUNY system besides Geneseo. I have also seen rankings country wide with Brockport now being rated around the 50-75 range of best schools. Highly recommend to anyone interested in attending a SUNY school in NY!","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2017-09-27T14:11:38.127297Z","guid":"00750c89-32db-49b5-8e2f-e5567883c4ba","rating":5},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":3}],"photos":{"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-77.949824,43.209862,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-77.949824,43.209862,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.4708063021316033,"count":1079},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Brockport, NY"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/suny-college-at-brockport/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"94e4218a-ac47-4835-a295-3f66dc255540","badge":{"display":"Best Colleges for Kinesiology and Therapy in America","ordinal":156,"total":378,"vanityURL":"best-colleges-for-physical-therapy"},"content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"Maryville College","type":"College","url":"maryville-college"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.5779},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":15542},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"880-1140"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Alum","body":"Wonderful college!
