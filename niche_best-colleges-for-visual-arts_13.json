People here care and go out of their way to create relationships with you. Olivet gives you an education with a Christian purpose. There are lots of opportunities to get involved on campus outside of class. Intramurals happen year-round and are competitive and fun. Olivet puts on all-school parties/events during syllabus week and around holidays with free food and games. Olivet really caters to freshmen to make sure they have a great experience and feel like they belong. There are always plenty of jobs on and off campus as there is a pretty large community around campus. Every room comes with a Tempur-Pedic bed, making it impossible to get out of bed in the morning. High ceilings for bunking beds to create more room. After freshman year, you have an option to live off-campus in an apartment.  All rent is included in the room and board fees. All laundry is free on and off campus.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2018-05-17T15:27:58.911548Z","guid":"86e16a4d-1045-4c28-ac50-c3abc4ebc221","rating":5},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":3}],"photos":{"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-87.873654,41.155489,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-87.873654,41.155489,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.691693290734824,"count":1252},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Bourbonnais, IL"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/olivet-nazarene-university/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"5586a9bd-51af-4b9b-9b81-5845bbc38748","content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"Frostburg State University","type":"College","url":"frostburg-state-university"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.6272},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":13208},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"860-1070"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Freshman","body":"I really liked the atmosphere of the campus.

Cons, being that it is such a huge university parking can be a hassle and the walking can be tiresome. There is a wide range of people there so of course a few aren't going to be the most pleasant. All in all I truly enjoy Kent State and cannot wait to further my education here!","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2018-06-01T17:49:42.813234Z","guid":"39f3ef2a-d3d1-494b-aa89-597fc41c0276","rating":5},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":3}],"photos":{"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-81.342253,41.146856,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-81.342253,41.146856,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.588814210273644,"count":4166},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Kent, OH"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/kent-state-university/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"4209c79b-e760-4be7-bd6e-df6603ec2c14","content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"University of Tennessee - Martin","type":"College","url":"university-of-tennessee---martin"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.667},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":10430},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"975-1170"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Freshman","body":"I haven't yet started here, but can't wait! I've toured three times, twice with my Ag class and once with my mother. It is a great campus and everything is relatively close. The professors I met were nothing but nice and encouraging. My friends that currently attend all say its a great school and that the classes are content filled with a low student to teacher ratio, which is important to me. It is also a fairly calm campus from what I've heard with very few parties. The dorms are nice and clean and the food on campus is great.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2018-04-09T15:43:43.599548Z","guid":"b84dfb57-51b1-477f-bb9d-644239a76c94","rating":5},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":3}],"photos":{"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-88.864211,36.340338,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-88.864211,36.340338,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.582089552238806,"count":871},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Martin, TN"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/university-of-tennessee---martin/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"960c5fd7-bb09-4c22-a8f9-51585a3eb5c3","content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":true,"isPremium":false,"name":"Kutztown University of Pennsylvania","type":"College","url":"kutztown-university-of-pennsylvania"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.7977},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":19385},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"880-1080"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Freshman","body":"I am a freshman at Kutztown University and right now I am in my second semester. The professors are wonderful. They are passionate and want to help you and see you succeed. The campus is beautiful and I feel very safe walking around. I think both cafeterias are excellent and there are so many choices, including a sushi bar! I live on campus in Dixon Hall and it is extremely nice, the dorms are suite-style and the whole building is secure and airconditioned. My favorite part of the campus has to be the student recreation center. The fitness center is my absolute favorite place to go and it is packed with any machine that you could want. Also inside the rec center is an awesome rock wall, some courts, an indoor track and a smoothie bar! I spend most of my time here and I love having it just a walking distance away from my room. So far Kutztown has been great!","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2018-02-09T23:35:07.153386Z","guid":"983dbb21-731f-4b08-bc10-387b9fe74fdc","rating":4},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":2.66}],"photos":{"default":{"crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/afd8b66b572da434133adc2760d1caed10aba446.jpg","MobileHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/07c737e157b9140f00102f72efdcc94ccd064996.jpg"},"licenseName":"UNLICENSED"},"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-75.785426,40.513705,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-75.785426,40.513705,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.4009797060881737,"count":1429},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Kutztown, PA"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/kutztown-university-of-pennsylvania/#scatterplot"}}]}
