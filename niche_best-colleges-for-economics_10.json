I have never once felt like I couldn't go to a professor for help with something, and even if I couldn't, there are multiple organizations and areas to receive help in all my classes. VMI has excellent major-related and Gen Ed. classes, especially in the STEM fields. That being said, there aren't many elective classes, and there are virtually no art-type classes (art history, music, etc). Classes are all pretty small, with the largest I've seen being about 24 students. Given the school only has about 1,700 students at any given time, this is understandable. Class styles are all pretty similar, with classrooms generally being of the same design across the board, with obvious variations for labs.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2016-07-20T16:23:52Z","guid":"a1845130-46dd-4084-b242-b5a26fb598af","rating":4},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":4}],"photos":{"default":{"crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/afc842363afa32b406a48ef9d159fdf3842f80f9.jpg","MobileHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/a58cba0c6eed68533ae9635841ad36edeb9a465e.jpg"},"licenseName":"UNLICENSED"},"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-79.435737,37.790644,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-79.435737,37.790644,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.3535911602209945,"count":181},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Lexington, VA"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/virginia-military-institute/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"f065fb88-c933-474f-abb3-98eb0421a583","content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"St. John's University - New York","type":"College","url":"st-johns-university---new-york"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.6336},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":26582},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"970-1180"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Junior","body":"Aside from its numerous Division 1 athletic teams and gorgeous campus attractions, SJU has an extensive umbrella of support systems and student life opportunities for its Johnnies.

I will be an incoming freshman this fall and while I was at orientation I noticed a lot of awesome things. First off, the professors and faculty members at Hofstra are there to make sure you're at your best 24/7. There's so many places to go to receive help, it's very reassuring especially when you're having a bad day. Next, the campus and the dorms are nice. The campus is very large which means a lot of walking, but it's not that bad because there's such beautiful architecture and landscaping to look at. The dorms are small and neat, but there's air conditioning which is a major plus. I got to sit through a real college class, which at Hofstra are relatively small. The food at Hofstra has a pretty good selection, but nothing crazy. There are Starbucks, Dunkin Donuts, Subways, Sbarros, and many other places to grab a bite to eat. Overall, Hofstra has a lot to offer and I couldn't be more excited to start my 4-year journey there!","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2017-08-17T13:19:43.218362Z","guid":"0f59bdeb-af97-4200-988e-1f0722fbf2d9","rating":4},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":3.33}],"photos":{"default":{"crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/2fb77d3e7ebcda2dfc09ad08572622874a2ade97.jpg","MobileHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/667677aae7cb8cd43b8b8fa8cb1993cc9e04e87a.jpg"},"licenseName":"UNLICENSED"},"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-73.60078,40.715959,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-73.60078,40.715959,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.483424047501237,"count":2021},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Hempstead, NY"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/hofstra-university/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"db834c81-d7d7-47f3-9371-301211841fb4","content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"Saint Joseph's University","type":"College","url":"saint-josephs-university"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.7793},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":36058},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"1050-1230"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Junior","body":"Saint Joseph's University is a well balanced 4-year university. It's location is ideal, only a quick trip into Philadelphia, but offers a large, green campus to make you feel at home. There are many near by towns that offer fun things to do, but the campus life is HUGE. There are so many ways to get involved! The academics are fair. You truly get a liberal arts experience, taking courses in all different areas of studies. The business school is career driven which is a huge positive, having a focus on getting a job in the future. SJU is a perfect size to make you feel welcome and help you step out of your comfort zone. It has about 5,000 undergraduate students allowing it to feel big and small all at the same time. Additionally, there is a large focus on service and the Jesuit ideals,  allowing students to be immersed in it, but also allowing them to decipher if they want to be involved in that aspect.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2018-05-23T18:46:04.163758Z","guid":"512f4a49-cbdb-4eff-8040-0ff92f07e091","rating":4},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":3.33}],"photos":{"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-75.238343,39.994442,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-75.238343,39.994442,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.527461139896373,"count":965},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Philadelphia, PA"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/saint-josephs-university/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"cdc01707-8be3-4736-a753-0f82ad571a10","content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":true,"isPremium":false,"name":"Siena College","type":"College","url":"siena-college"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.7261},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":26816},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"1020-1220"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Freshman","body":"Best school ever.
