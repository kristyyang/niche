Despite all of its flaws and imperfections, it is a safe space where I can explore and learn. The campus itself is a small city with features that make it feel more cozy than full-out sophisticated. From our beautiful Cathedral of Learning (we lovingly call her Cathy) to the spacious Schenley Park, there are tons of secret nooks that are perfect for studying. The professors, while teaching multiple classes, still make themselves available for questions outside the classroom. They are never too busy to stop and chat if you see them around campus; they really care about your education and that you have a passion for what you are studying. Overall, Pitt is an amazing college to attend. The community surrounding the campus challenge you and support you all at once.

Printing services are more than adequate - 500 free pages per year (I only used about 200 this year!). Dining services are adequate and they're always looking to improve.

They are all passionate, smart, experts in their fields, and although some styles of teaching may clash I have never felt afraid to go and ask a professor for help. The small class sizes definitely help the close atmosphere one can develop with professors. The number of extracurriculars you can apply yourself to are also amazing. There's a club for everything. And I will plug a little about the theater group the College Players as I am a part of that! We have the second oldest student-run college theater group in the USA, second only to Harvard.

You will never be bored at the University of Minnesota as there is always something to do, whether that be exploring downtown, going to a concert, or kayaking on one of Minnesota's thousands of lakes.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2017-10-10T01:22:58.68552Z","guid":"ee4e1265-007e-4b96-9886-ae39d69a5325","rating":5},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":4.33}],"photos":{"default":{"crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/7c47197b6c681420e1ff9d02ca34965497f26980.jpg","MobileHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/ef6340f29dc14c077821ffa24b79426fbb40b939.jpg","Thumbnail":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/4a49146903513d434ea8f272942e8a4bbc35b374"},"licenseName":"UNLICENSED"},"mapbox_header":{"crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-93.235352,44.977886,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-93.235352,44.977886,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"UNLICENSED"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.671489149413819,"count":4009},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Minneapolis, MN"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/university-of-minnesota---twin-cities/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"2fd6ef0a-103f-4e20-948d-ab97aeee639e","badge":{"display":"Best Colleges for Nursing in America","ordinal":40,"total":580,"vanityURL":"best-colleges-for-nursing"},"content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":true,"isPremium":true,"name":"Samford University","type":"College","url":"samford-university"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.9138},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":29544},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"1020-1238"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Freshman","body":"If you are looking for a smaller and more conservative school where your professors can know you well you should look no further than Samford! It is a gorgeous campus. It also has an amazing staff who take the time to know you well. It is a Southern Baptist school, so most of the students have more conservative values although they are not insanely conservative and are very open minded to the ideas of other individuals. Samford is also located in a nice area of Birmingham, AL that offers enough fun to try something new every weekend. The area also contains many healthy churches that can enrich your college experience ten-fold.\nThere are some pitfalls. The diversity here is a bit pitiful and the conservative atmosphere of the school may also be suffocating to certain individuals. Parties are fairly few and far between. However, it is easy to find other places in Birmingham to party or dance if you are looking for that sort of scene.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2018-01-19T18:22:13.325725Z","guid":"b798cac4-162b-4396-9ee9-bb303e73ad0f","rating":5},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":3.66}],"photos":{"default":{"crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/15fccd3ac6b7a2c2969729c22316a789adc3748f.jpg","MobileHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/8ad7f28e75dee67d79ce128d598ad4705f4728f3.jpg"},"licenseName":"UNLICENSED"},"mapbox_header":{"crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-86.790932,33.464578,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-86.790932,33.464578,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"UNLICENSED"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.7466666666666666,"count":675},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Birmingham, AL"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/samford-university/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"3caf26ee-500a-4d25-8f5d-8b46331eae68","badge":{"display":"Best Colleges for Nursing in America","ordinal":41,"total":580,"vanityURL":"best-colleges-for-nursing"},"content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"Maryville University","type":"College","url":"maryville-university"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.928},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":26654},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"900-1150"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Freshman","body":"I love Maryville!

Sure, it does not have the big school sports scene but the college was top ranked in division two in severals sports. Security seems tight so far and there's a real emphasis on community service. If you want a school where the student will not get lost in a crowd and will get a very good foundation, Rockhurst is an under the radar gem with well respected academics as with most Jesuit colleges.

After visiting Simpson, Drake, and other private Midwest four year institutions I must say that Creighton's Campus just felt like home.  The professors are all supportive and with a small student to teacher ratio, I feel like an actual person in their classes and can build a relationship with the professors.  The food is excellent, Godfather's Pizza, Chinese, Latin American, Sushi, Burgers, and buffet styled mess halls are a good indication of the different food at Creighton.  The dorms are a little on the dated side, yet they have modern amenities.  The older buildings really gives the place a theme and a warm glow.  Everything is nice and compact seeing that this campus is in the middle of Omaha and all of my classes are within 10-15 minutes of one another.  The advisors are always courteous and listen to the students needs and wants.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2018-05-31T18:36:22.198929Z","guid":"7cb7e8b5-ca43-4732-8bc5-2aa9bae9ad48","rating":4},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":3.66}],"photos":{"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-95.947029,41.265325,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-95.947029,41.265325,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.591194968553459,"count":954},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Omaha, NE"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/creighton-university/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"f78e217a-fb90-4ff1-87cb-8cc9bbd9e75f","badge":{"display":"Best Colleges for Nursing in America","ordinal":47,"total":580,"vanityURL":"best-colleges-for-nursing"},"content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"University of Alabama - Birmingham","type":"College","url":"university-of-alabama---birmingham"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.5814},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":16092},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"970-1300"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Graduate Student","body":"I love UAB because you get to experience a world that is extremely diverse!

They also had a \"bar\" which consisted of virgin drinks. Rock the rec consisted of key logging, silent disco, glow in the dark dodgeball and rock climbing. We played capture the flag until 2am and last but not least, we had a huge rave paint party with an awesome DJ until close to midnight. \n\nClass wise, the classes aren't huge unlike UA or Auburn which is great for one on one time.
