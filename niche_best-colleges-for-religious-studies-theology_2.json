It gives us students more individual time with the professor if need be. \nI like the diversity of the students. An estimated 30% of the students are forgieners. Also also like the location. SWCU is just on the outskirts of downtown OKC, located in Bethany. With only a 15 minute drive, one could find themselves at the front door of the Chesapeake Areana, home of the Thunder. There's quite a lot to do in OKC. Ones first impression may say that the city is small and scattered, but if you look hard enough there is great things there. Same with SWCU. The opportunities that SWCU off are just about limitless. The relationship one might build with fellow students, could be some of the most important ones in life. Who knows when one might need to travel to London, South Africa, or Victoria Australia, to make a business deal? \nGreat school in my opinion. You just have to look deeper and find the great things within.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2016-12-30T11:42:26.629313Z","guid":"a069c8d5-67fc-415c-8eda-a2ea12b11189","rating":4},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":2.66}],"photos":{"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-97.639411,35.513596,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-97.639411,35.513596,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.7669172932330826,"count":133},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Bethany, OK"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/southwestern-christian-university/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"82a0491d-f53c-4ca6-934d-abc0a7afa1ec","badge":{"display":"Best Colleges for Religious Studies in America","ordinal":31,"total":197,"vanityURL":"best-colleges-for-religious-studies"},"content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":true,"isPremium":true,"name":"Bob Jones University","type":"College","url":"bob-jones-university"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.8737},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":16258},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"900-1210"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Niche User","body":"I enjoyed just about everything!

Whether you're a Christian or not the relationships created with students, faculty, and professors goes beyond the classroom and prepares you for life, your career, and a source of encouragement for difficulties life throws your way. It challenges you academically and the professors aren't there for the paycheck only, they are passionate scholars who desire their students to grow academically, so they can become scholars as well. Hope successfully lives up to its name.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2018-03-06T00:43:37.595069Z","guid":"e430bd3c-17d0-4801-b592-3e37d0d00e84","rating":4},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":2.66}],"photos":{"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-117.88573,33.87616,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-117.88573,33.87616,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.5582329317269075,"count":249},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Fullerton, CA"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/hope-international-university/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"91b804b4-db9b-4a91-bf94-52ef45c76456","badge":{"display":"Best Colleges for Religious Studies in America","ordinal":36,"total":197,"vanityURL":"best-colleges-for-religious-studies"},"content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"Lincoln Christian University","type":"College","url":"lincoln-christian-university"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.5288},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":20123},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"870-1000"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Graduate Student","body":"Well, I am impressed by the high level of teaching at LCU.

While being a non-denominational Christian college that requires some religious courses, the faculty and staff do not ostracize or penalize anyone for choosing another path in life. The only downsides to the college are the location (Kansas has little to do, and small town Kansas has less) and the cost. The private school is fairly expensive to attend.

NNU has 4 main values: Transformation, Truth, Community, and Service.\n\nAlongside that, NNU has an amazing community surrounded by individuals who invest in others. NNU welcomes every one. Class sizes at NNU are small, which enables professors to instill personal time into every student. NNU also puts on weekly, fun and exciting events for students to connect deeper with one another. \n\nI would highly recommend NNU to anyone!","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2017-05-07T21:52:33.442459Z","guid":"36e51e85-f831-4576-ba70-a2a902dd9b40","rating":5},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":3.33}],"photos":{"default":{"crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/c2b5c84fc1b186143eec1e4182d5b6c29c42e2a1.jpg","MobileHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/cc8f89e695b62d60a203c95abd6e047b3d38eaaa.jpg"},"licenseName":"UNLICENSED"},"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-116.564792,43.563181,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-116.564792,43.563181,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.960294117647059,"count":680},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Nampa, ID"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/northwest-nazarene-university/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"de36523d-c2ed-42ea-8a88-2249330fe37a","badge":{"display":"Best Colleges for Religious Studies in America","ordinal":44,"total":197,"vanityURL":"best-colleges-for-religious-studies"},"content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"Calvary Bible College & Theological Seminary","type":"College","url":"calvary-bible-college--and--theological-seminary"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.9773},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":13904},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"715-895"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Junior","body":"I love Calvary University and appreciate that I can obtain biblical training and foundation for my life at a price that I can afford.

What I mean by this is, many come to Vanguard with broken pieces or just completely unsure of who they are but after being on campus they quickly realize that God has strategically placed them right where they are. Vanguard is filled with bright life's willing to take on the world with the sole flame of Jesus with-in them. If there was anything that should be changed with-in Vanguard it is definitely towards the food being provided. It is not that the food is bad, it just could be better. If all a campus needs to improve is foodservice, they must be doing something right. Vanguard is a home to many people who have discovered who they are. It is a school that not only excels with excellent professors and campus life, but a school that takes your purpose and morphs it into a future.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2018-02-22T20:37:12.806526Z","guid":"a6824192-ced9-4bce-b046-6315a01728c5","rating":5},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":3.33}],"photos":{"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-117.900911,33.662686,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-117.900911,33.662686,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.759305210918114,"count":806},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Costa Mesa, CA"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/vanguard-university-of-southern-california/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"864919d6-f9c8-4d98-8ee1-87ae2283b9a7","badge":{"display":"Best Colleges for Religious Studies in America","ordinal":52,"total":197,"vanityURL":"best-colleges-for-religious-studies"},"content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"Oklahoma Christian University","type":"College","url":"oklahoma-christian-university"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.6082},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":19344},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"940-1220"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Junior","body":"I decided to attend Oklahoma Christian University at the last minute, and it is a decision that I have never regretted. For a school whose motto is \" OC is home\", it really does feel like home. It is a loving environment where you are constantly surrounded by like-minded Christians who, for the most part, share similar beliefs. College is a time where you meet life long friends, and I believe that I have done that. The professors are also amazing. They care so deeply about their students, and desire to know them on a personal level, and that is such a wonderful thing. It helps you to feel at home at Oklahoma Christian.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2018-06-05T03:49:37.84172Z","guid":"4212d9a1-6cb3-449b-a1f4-1f0816b53d69","rating":5},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":3}],"photos":{"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-97.468312,35.609042,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-97.468312,35.609042,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.7734241908006814,"count":587},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Edmond, OK"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/oklahoma-christian-university/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"f6e3f0a5-35d7-47ff-88b1-754f654d3a49","badge":{"display":"Best Colleges for Religious Studies in America","ordinal":53,"total":197,"vanityURL":"best-colleges-for-religious-studies"},"content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"Kuyper College","type":"College","url":"kuyper-college"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.7338},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":15426},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"900-1100"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"College Sophomore","body":"I absolutely love the small-school atmosphere at Kuyper, and the ease with which I am able to build relationships within the student body. The students Kuyper attracts all have similar goals and passions, and it is a joy to be surrounded by a family that will both push me towards excellence and walk that same road with me. \r\n\r\nThe professors are kind, intelligent, understanding, and well-equipped to prepare us with the knowledge we need to succeed. On several occasions I have had professors go out of their way to email or stop me in the halls to encourage me on a personal level. Not only do they each know me by name, but they remember details about my life and take time to invest in me both in and out of the classroom. \r\n\r\nThe Kuyper campus is beautiful, and with only one academic building, all classrooms are less than a 3-minute walk away. \r\n\r\nFaculty and staff are also warm and engaging, ready to answer questions and point in the right direction as needed.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2016-07-29T15:33:27Z","guid":"6547f173-fbfe-4e5d-8f0f-e0afe45df82d","rating":4},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":2.66}],"photos":{"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-85.592657,43.02195,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-85.592657,43.02195,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.8026315789473686,"count":76},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Grand Rapids, MI"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/kuyper-college/#scatterplot"}}]}
