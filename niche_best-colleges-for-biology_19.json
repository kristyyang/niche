For such a small private liberal arts college the professors are A+ material, and they really care that you succeed.

First, there are a lot of positive aspects about academics. I liked that there were small class sizes, lots of hand-on-experience in classes, no TAs, and you could easily build relationships with professors. Another positive is that the dining hall has an excellent selection of food and is top rated in the country. I liked that there was many ways to get involved on campus such as Greek life, Volunteer work, and other clubs and organizations, as well as athletics. The Rec Center was also extremely nice. Downfalls of Ashland include a lack of parking (and lots of parking tickets), the fact that it is a dry campus, and poor quality in housing/dorms. The dorms are mostly small, old, and many do not have air conditioning.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2018-01-04T20:41:20.901223Z","guid":"94458c53-0abe-47d9-b32a-eb48312e56ad","rating":4},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":3}],"photos":{"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-82.320621,40.860987,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-82.320621,40.860987,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.6349924585218703,"count":663},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Ashland, OH"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/ashland-university/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"df484f3c-7077-4333-82f7-ea5dfa247c7c","content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":true,"isPremium":false,"name":"D'Youville College","type":"College","url":"dyouville-college"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.8057},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":20174},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"900-1090"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Junior","body":"Attending this college was the best decision I've ever made. I am very pleased with the quality of my education and the professors. I am enrolled in the Occupational Therapy BS/MS program and I have learned so much in the past 2 years. However, with the new president, there have been a lot of misplaced concern on what needs to be improved. The professors have been teaching without a contract for months which should be our administrations first priority. After that, the parking situation for this college made up of a majority of commuters should be addressed and the improving our existing buildings and facilities. New fields, gyms (for a D3 school), and other unnecessary expenses should be halted and priorities should be checked.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2018-05-29T19:51:14.696528Z","guid":"9a46a6aa-05d8-486a-8b23-58ef5b15707f","rating":4},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":2.66}],"photos":{"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-78.890369,42.902263,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-78.890369,42.902263,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.3380281690140845,"count":355},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Buffalo, NY"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/dyouville-college/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"4662e8d2-30af-481f-b32d-bde25f1108f8","content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":true,"isPremium":false,"name":"University of Texas - Arlington","type":"College","url":"university-of-texas---arlington"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.6982},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":11952},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"950-1190"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Sophomore","body":"I am a single mother of 2 girls (9&7) and I am finally finishing my degree in want I want to do.

My teaching advisor Miss Little has been wonderful in helping me finishing my teaching degree. \nI have had friends that have gone through the teaching program at UTA and all of them have gotten jobs before they have even graduated. There are high praises for the teaching program at UTA Arlington. \nI am truly impressed with the way the professors are really there to help you out. And if you cannot make their office hours they accommodate you with a different time so they can assist you. \nI am very impressed with the math program at UTA Arlington. I honestly did not think UTA Arlington was that good of a college until it started going there. I am very impressed.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2018-02-22T05:22:57.949525Z","guid":"85e62768-e4f7-436b-9e27-538b12642f98","rating":5},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":3}],"photos":{"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-97.115087,32.728437,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-97.115087,32.728437,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.6343467543138868,"count":3651},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Arlington, TX"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/university-of-texas---arlington/#scatterplot"}}]}
