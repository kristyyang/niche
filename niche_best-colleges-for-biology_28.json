I believe the latter houses the History, Psychology, and Teaching departments, but the building itself is rather dreary. They recently repainted the walls which is nice! The diversity is also very good, as an LGBT student, it's very accepting here and I appreciate it a lot. As for race and socioeconomic backgrounds, it's diverse in those aspects as well!

The campus is a very inviting environment; there are always events going on whether it is sports, diversity, or arts. The professors give off a warm, caring  aroma. No student should be afraid to ask for help from their professor; they are always willing whether it is through office hours or email. MSUM offers many ways to help students succeed; from tutoring to the Wellness Center for physical health. The campus is just the right size, not too small yet not overwhelming as well. As soon as I visited MSUM my senior year of high school, I knew it was home. Though, what I would like to see change is the exclusion from some activities held on campus. For example, they have activities that exclude some students from clubs or learning communities. I wish for more equality in allowing all students to be involved. Otherwise, I believe MSUM is a great place full of opportunities for students to further their education.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2017-11-26T05:07:52.397844Z","guid":"0ece1c33-a37d-4bed-abe0-cadcfc074cbc","rating":4},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":3}],"photos":{"default":{"crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/db9b3a0ff27f272424f505083bf388c9377f84cd.jpg","MobileHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/9579f183666104e0e7185a4591a4b5f6878c5147.jpg"},"licenseName":"UNLICENSED"},"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-96.763376,46.866482,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-96.763376,46.866482,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.4360795454545454,"count":704},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Moorhead, MN"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/minnesota-state-university-moorhead/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"768ce7e1-ce27-4258-b2dc-0b6f339427f7","content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":true,"isPremium":false,"name":"Seton Hill University","type":"College","url":"seton-hill-university"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.6087},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":23228},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"900-1150"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Junior","body":"I visited Seton Hill University during my high school senior year.  My visit included overnight lodging, meals, but most importantly inclusion in several classes I was interested in taking.  I decided this was the place I wanted to obtain my degree.

This is an older campus with great atmosphere.  It was very to transition from community college to university.   I plan on obtaining an Art Education degree and am taking full advantage of a three year old arts building which contains not only art studios, but studios for dance.  I would strongly advise anybody to include Seton Hill University on their must see.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2018-02-22T21:44:17.985189Z","guid":"61726ed2-d54f-47da-97e7-856f49aca3d1","rating":4},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":3}],"photos":{"default":{"crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/b06026905218d3c3ca4053c9029856e9e622f6c7.jpg","MobileHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/b2dec240be13299f7548e035000b823cccb5ee7e.jpg"},"licenseName":"UNLICENSED"},"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-79.556228,40.308623,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-79.556228,40.308623,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.6678966789667897,"count":813},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Greensburg, PA"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/seton-hill-university/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"2a97f7fd-da39-476f-8a72-3ebeb519914d","content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"Stevenson University","type":"College","url":"stevenson-university"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.6076},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":27686},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"910-1130"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Junior","body":"I love the small classroom sizes, I feel my professors really get to know me.

With all the money you are spending, there are free services (peer-tutoring for specific subjects, professional tutoring, resume help, career development planning, psychological services, borrowed calculators, etc).","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2018-06-02T03:11:23.025005Z","guid":"01a4f540-c635-464a-b11f-fa3c7e6b2cef","rating":4},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":3}],"photos":{"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-118.480471,34.082112,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-118.480471,34.082112,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.6409495548961424,"count":1011},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Los Angeles, CA"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/mount-saint-marys-university-ca/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"3a9f619c-c041-4aba-a4c6-f789b057ee3f","content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"University of Akron","type":"College","url":"university-of-akron"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.9592},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":16568},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"910-1180"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Niche User","body":"I had great experiences at the University of Akron!

Cannot beat the small class sizes and professor attention. Coming from Rutgers university i really appreciate that. Not as cutthroat as rutgers or other schools. I also actually like that each professor takes attendance and counts it as ten percent or more, of your grade. This encourages class attendance and pushes their students to do well. It is very possible to get a 4.0 if you show up to class and put in the effort, which for some classes requires less work than others.  I gave 4/5 because of the parking situation although they are trying to improve this situation by adding across the street parking. Parking is available but you may need to walk a bit or take the shuttle from other parts of campus.

I like going to watch all the sporting events and everyone is always very engaged!","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2018-02-27T04:44:55.493535Z","guid":"252852a5-1819-4c1d-b506-f52da9b925fb","rating":4},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":2.66}],"photos":{"default":{"crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/8e8e3f5e29a1df82ee044d31dbaedb0ade9b7b9e.jpg","MobileHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/d094406205baf48614bcc47d09390c0e5011fb4b.jpg"},"licenseName":"UNLICENSED"},"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-78.4057,40.5385,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-78.4057,40.5385,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.5053003533568905,"count":849},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Altoona, PA"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/penn-state-altoona/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"ae969791-109e-4a34-ae29-02d1efb43d3b","content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"California State University - Monterey Bay","type":"College","url":"california-state-university---monterey-bay"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.3524},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":11390},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"860-1080"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Niche User","body":"I am transferring there in the Spring, and so far the process has been easy! I was a bit worried because I was doing the process of applying on my own, but their website had step-by-step instructions which which were very helpful. The school has also kept me updated by sending me important deadlines and information via email. I have visited the campus a few times. Although, the location is beautiful and has history the actual campus is a bit dual. There are a few new buildings and parking lots, but I think the school needs improvement.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2017-10-13T00:01:52.330478Z","guid":"bed01b31-7c56-4d2d-9d2f-c415ec67ccda","rating":4},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":2.66}],"photos":{"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-121.799216,36.653724,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-121.799216,36.653724,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.395302013422819,"count":1490},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Seaside, CA"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/california-state-university---monterey-bay/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"b30e64cd-f2a2-45ea-9dd2-f0de7fcc1c6f","content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":true,"isPremium":false,"name":"Anderson University - Indiana","type":"College","url":"anderson-university---indiana"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.6642},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":23515},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"910-1110"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Freshman","body":"I love AU! It has a great community of students and faculty. All the professors want to help all their students succeed! I absolutely love being a part of this school. They have many different majors and minors, and if they don't offer what you want, they will help you find a way to get there! All of the faculty members are so motivated to help their students, and you can tell they all love what they do. The athletics programs are pretty great too! The coaches are invested in their athletes and want to help them achieve their best!","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2016-10-12T12:45:08.682713Z","guid":"66b363c2-4c39-4480-b18e-9e21d70ac7d8","rating":5},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":2.66}],"photos":{"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-85.662292,40.112167,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-85.662292,40.112167,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.4991789819376025,"count":609},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Anderson, IN"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/anderson-university---indiana/#scatterplot"}}]}
