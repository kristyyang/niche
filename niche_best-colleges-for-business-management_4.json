The professors here really care about your college experience, and the counselors are extremely open to helping you out when you are struggling with your classes/major/whatever it may be.  If there was something that I could recommend that we add to our campus it would be to maybe remodel the interior of the Knight library, because it's definitely starting to fall apart.

About to finish my third year, I can say with certainty that my parents' money is paying off.  I have taken at least three courses that have permanently shaped the way I view the world and continue to influence me every single day.  Professors are incredible and very easy to access outside of class.  There are also so many extracurricular activities to participate in, and if something you want is not there, it is very easy to start your own club!  The campus dining services are incredible.  Dhall is life and I would be so lost without Spa and Burgess.  Dorms and on-campus apartments are spacious and have everything you could possibly need!  I definitely made the right choice coming here.  There is no Greek life, which is awesome in my opinion.

They encourage unity while allowing you to be yourself.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2018-05-26T20:33:57.309784Z","guid":"563d23ba-25b7-4d19-a82f-35c9a2e8d4b2","rating":5},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":4}],"photos":{"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-75.7536,39.679791,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-75.7536,39.679791,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.597298166613059,"count":3109},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Newark, DE"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/university-of-delaware/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"d3866e88-49fd-47ad-a8bc-6b74f86b9c33","badge":{"display":"Best Colleges for Business in America","ordinal":83,"total":1020,"vanityURL":"best-colleges-for-business"},"content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":true,"isPremium":false,"name":"Saint Louis University","type":"College","url":"saint-louis-university"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.6474},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":33222},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"1110-1330"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Sophomore","body":"As a current sophomore at Saint Louis University, I want to preface by saying that I could not see myself at any other university. SLU is an extremely open college where you will meet people from diverse backgrounds who have different experiences. Of course, people will always complain and say that the \"rich white people\" surround SLU. However, if you actually try and engage in the SLU community you will find more than just that. SLU has given me life long friends and an education that I am proud of. So far my classes have gone well and are usually well taught. If there are any complaints, there are always surveys at the end of the semester that go straight to the department heads for review. Finding the right college for you is difficult. I was lucky enough to fall in love with SLU as soon as I visited. I definitely suggest visiting and doing an overnight to see if SLU is right for you.

Extremely strict rules and regulations where violation for missed class or other minor offense may result in 5 hours punishment usually conducted in a physical manner such as marching.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2018-04-30T04:20:17.92536Z","guid":"6f6ba94d-f985-405c-9e2f-8f3764a7ccd3","rating":4},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":4}],"photos":{"default":{"crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/51e986c81df748188b50ed870393ebecffc7cbb6.jpg","MobileHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/3b21d23561fa817efb6037499fa79c553901ddf5.jpg"},"licenseName":"UNLICENSED"},"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-73.956804,41.390882,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-73.956804,41.390882,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.349090909090909,"count":275},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"West Point, NY"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/united-states-military-academy-at-west-point/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"6d81d181-4b7b-434c-bf08-669079673e7c","badge":{"display":"Best Colleges for Business in America","ordinal":90,"total":1020,"vanityURL":"best-colleges-for-business"},"content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"University of Colorado - Boulder","type":"College","url":"university-of-colorado---boulder"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.7662},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":22727},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"1070-1310"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Sophomore","body":"I love Boulder!

You are free to either party all the time, work-hard, or find a healthy medium. Boulder students know how to get involved in the outdoors so it is not difficult to find someone to bike with, hike with, or relax on lawns in the sunshine with.

However, I would recommend that after freshman year, you live somewhere within walking distance to campus, because the parking here is absolutely awful and you will absolutely regret commuting to campus and spending nearly 2 hours looking for a parking spot everyday, even with a parking pass that costs hundreds of dollars. Also Dale Hall is a ridiculous building and if you have a class there, get there early because trying to make your way through the crowds in that building can sometimes take a while. The parking situation & Dale Hall is the only thing preventing me from giving this great school 5 stars.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2017-11-06T00:20:34.290457Z","guid":"75f25a4a-6e57-4df8-b0a2-0b3897295b1c","rating":4},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":4}],"photos":{"default":{"crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/6a7d7e2d5c708a009e6b4857db0d69cf2efb39c4.jpg","MobileHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/eeb1688e862a426894b97137be0e4145307a7a24.jpg","Thumbnail":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/0dfb8859200ebd86bfb0acaf4b7740bcc6822455"},"licenseName":"UNLICENSED"},"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-97.445692,35.208152,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-97.445692,35.208152,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.7810136157337366,"count":2644},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Norman, OK"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/university-of-oklahoma/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"e2c23d77-a108-41a1-b566-05fcb2e742c6","badge":{"display":"Best Colleges for Business in America","ordinal":93,"total":1020,"vanityURL":"best-colleges-for-business"},"content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"Oklahoma State University","type":"College","url":"oklahoma-state-university"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.7452},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":13951},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"970-1200"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Sophomore","body":"All of my first year professors were very kind and knowledgeable about the subjects they taught.

From our beautiful Cathedral of Learning (we lovingly call her Cathy) to the spacious Schenley Park, there are tons of secret nooks that are perfect for studying. The professors, while teaching multiple classes, still make themselves available for questions outside the classroom. They are never too busy to stop and chat if you see them around campus; they really care about your education and that you have a passion for what you are studying.

Being in Providence means there is always something to do or new to try. While it may not be the safest city, campus security helps make PC feel like it is in its own \"bubble\". Even though the food is not the best on campus, do not feel discouraged because the food off campus is always a hit! Dorms are mostly average, some are great while some of the older buildings definitely need renovation. Athletics are a big plus to this school whether you will be playing or in the audience. The school is strongly affiliated with the Catholic faith, however, all of the professors and Dominican Friars will be welcoming of all religious backgrounds. Also, PC may be lacking in diversity but I can tell they are trying to be more inclusive, especially when it comes to clubs and organizations. Overall, a great (and expensive) school. I am very proud to call myself a Friar!","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2018-03-22T18:20:25.990601Z","guid":"94024240-0708-4fc6-80bf-dcd813e97e21","rating":4},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":4}],"photos":{"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-71.43792,41.844064,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-71.43792,41.844064,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.6363636363636362,"count":748},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Providence, RI"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/providence-college/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"c323725c-f4bb-49c3-90d4-e35b25c46a29","badge":{"display":"Best Colleges for Business in America","ordinal":97,"total":1020,"vanityURL":"best-colleges-for-business"},"content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"University of California - Davis","type":"College","url":"university-of-california---davis"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.4228},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":16039},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"1050-1330"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Sophomore","body":"Davis empowers its student body by encouraging cultural awareness by hosting International Week, providing study abroad programs (and financial aid), having gender-inclusive restrooms throughout campus and the Student Community Center with a Cross-Cultural Center and LGBTQIA Center, a safe place for all students to hang out or study.

With a campus in the \"capital of the world\", the location provides opportunities unrivaled by others.  By planning ahead, you can schedule classes with some top-notch professors who actively help students succeed and provide an unforgettable learning experience.  Though Core requirements are extensive, even excessive to some, they make way for an education that explores all fields.  The Jesuit presence is in no way overbearing and the community is open to a diversity of thought (Professors are almost always unrelated to the Church; even theology classes teach a variety of religions).  The Rose Hill campus is quite beautiful, boasting sports teams, a large library, and a variety of eateries.  Both campuses are very safe and any incidents are vigilantly pursued by campus safety and the NYPD. Fordham can be a very good experience, if deemed worth the price point (note they do award aid) and if one is willing to take advantage of their time there.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2018-06-05T17:39:23.039915Z","guid":"c7e106e7-e1c4-45d2-8987-d3382185aaa0","rating":4},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":3.66}],"photos":{"default":{"crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/58a16aa62394c04c88abf70482b6dfc699f8d219.jpg","MobileHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/2a5478c448466060f510b754b7a99112cf2dbc0c.jpg"},"licenseName":"UNLICENSED"},"mapbox_header":{"crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-73.889578,40.861183,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-73.889578,40.861183,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"UNLICENSED"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.4920049200492005,"count":1626},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Bronx, NY"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/fordham-university/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"d5a8a9d2-33cc-48bb-9c90-4647317d5075","badge":{"display":"Best Colleges for Business in America","ordinal":99,"total":1020,"vanityURL":"best-colleges-for-business"},"content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":true,"isPremium":true,"name":"Colorado State University","type":"College","url":"colorado-state-university"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.7796},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":16232},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"1020-1250"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Alum","body":"Colorado State University met all my expectations for the college I had always imagined going to for my bachelors degree. Unfortunately for me, at the time I had no clue what I wanted out of life and very little passion for the degree I had chosen to study there which was Journalism. I had no direction, no motivation, and no confidence which quickly led to my demise. Finally, over three years later, I now have realized my path and it has absolutely nothing to do with CSU or politics. I am sure it's a great school with tons to offer if you apply yourself, but to be honest I got very little out of my education there and feel like I may have waisted a lot of time and money during my 7 year stint at Colorado State University.
