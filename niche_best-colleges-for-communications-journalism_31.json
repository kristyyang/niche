My professors have been friendly, genuinely passionate about their subjects and invested in my progress. The food is AMAZING for campus food - It regularly changes and encompasses different ethnic foods. \nFor the School of Education specifically, I can say the advisors are quirky and fun and up for casual check ins and in prompt to drop ins from their advisees. No where is perfect but I honestly can say I wouldn’t have chosen anywhere else.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2017-12-29T04:27:35.410285Z","guid":"3cc8c75d-eaa4-4312-b37f-a807343403cd","rating":4},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":3.66}],"photos":{"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-122.726859,45.571807,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-122.726859,45.571807,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.625,"count":856},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Portland, OR"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/university-of-portland/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"fbc0bde8-b345-45cf-a8e4-732d5de6ed3a","content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"Southern Oregon University","type":"College","url":"southern-oregon-university"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.782},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":8939},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"900-1130"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Junior","body":"My experience here at SOU has gradually increased and has become the best decision of my life.

Two things that I would like changed is the amount of attention that is needed between the Advisors and Financial Aid. They both are major aspects to my learning, but I found that they both don’t know anything about each other so there was a lot of back and forth between offices I had to do.

The extracurricular activities as well as the academic classes were absolutely phenomenal. There were opportunities to grow as an individual as well as a community. I was even able to join a sorority. I played Volleyball, was committed to the sorority and was in plays and musicals while attending SJC. This gave me so many opportunities and opened so many doors to my future career path.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2018-01-30T19:20:51.094953Z","guid":"76e7f54d-c1d2-4b64-8dec-f201b29db712","rating":5},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":3}],"photos":{"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-73.968037,40.690485,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-73.968037,40.690485,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.5482625482625485,"count":259},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Brooklyn, NY"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/st-josephs-college---new-york/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"724acb5d-26a8-42df-8c74-1609fb262a55","content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"Indiana University - Southeast","type":"College","url":"indiana-university---southeast"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.8401},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":10198},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"830-1040"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Sophomore","body":"I am grateful for the experience that I have had here at IUS so far!

This is currently my second semester at UF and I have had only positive experiences. The professors and laid back, nice and willing to help you out. They're nothing like the stereotypical college professors who are strict and impatient. There is always something to do at Findlay; whether that means a club activity, free food, free shirts, seminars, concerts and many other possibilities. The professors, staff and students are all very friendly and great to be around. The campus is well maintained and beautiful in the spring and summer. The vibe around campus if friendly and welcoming to everyone. I am so glad to be at such a wonderful college that has helped me explore and grow.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2018-03-19T23:30:41.552485Z","guid":"5fc57a48-00b2-4832-a2ad-f6d2fb7cd908","rating":5},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":3}],"photos":{"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-83.652067,41.05441,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-83.652067,41.05441,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.5319148936170213,"count":752},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Findlay, OH"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/university-of-findlay/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"7b4ac68b-b5f3-4ce7-b1db-4e3c1427d3d5","content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"Henderson State University","type":"College","url":"henderson-state-university"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.6611},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":11219},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"1018-1030"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Niche User","body":"Well, I haven't gotten to actually be a student yet.
