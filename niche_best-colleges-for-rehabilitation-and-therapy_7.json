Profs are great and super helpful. There are tons of resources on campus. It is a small school so you get all the attention you could ever need. We have access to a fabulous DO medical school if you are interested in research.  We just built a new business school and just got a beautiful donation for the education college. Marian is a great place. We are so close to Indy it is great but we are also close to speedway and other surrounding cities so it is easy to commute if you need.

In the beginning I was uncomfortable with my transition and unable to feel at home. Through clubs and sports teams I was able to develop new friendships and life skills that made me feel more at home. There are so many opportunities presented to students at USC that all should take advantage of. One of the most important things that is clearly valued here, is academics. My professors so far have been some of the most passionate people I have met. A favorite course I have taken here has been environmental ethics. I took this course as a philosophy requirement and it inspired me to change my major to environmental studies. The professor and the course material inspired me to make a decision that I will not soon regret. I am more than happy to say that I am a student at USC. If someone decides to attend school here, I bet they will say the same thing.

If you are struggling in one of your classes, you can go to your professors office hours and get all of the help you need. Your professors set you up for success, not for failure.

Though, it goes far beyond the simple fact that the school is building new facilities...any school can do that. Rather, its the culture that exists where the school itself is constantly striving to be better, which is why our mascot, the pioneer, is fitting. SHU is constantly pioneering what a college can be.

As far as academics go, the school offers many opportunities to choose from so I’m sure incoming students will feel at home. Moreover, the professors are friendly and really want you to succeed, so if you’re the type that worries about not having individual attention, no need to worry here because the class ratio is perfect for that matter.

I took out loans the first two years, but received a full-ride the last two years.\nAbout 90% of my profess were intellectually stimulating and very friendly. They welcome students during office hours and actually want to see you succeed. The advisors are the BEST! They are very supportive. The business career center is a great asset of UIC. The advisors help students find internships and full-time jobs after graduation.\nOverall, I would rate UIC a 8.2/10. They are definitely lacking in the social aspect and should coordinate more vibrant events.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2018-04-26T17:56:19.949051Z","guid":"98e81e06-7ce2-4632-a8e7-b9e4a199bc1d","rating":4},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":3.66}],"photos":{"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-87.651145,41.872651,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-87.651145,41.872651,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.5712780898876404,"count":2848},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Chicago, IL"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/university-of-illinois-at-chicago/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"d4ea7326-5370-4b5e-9e5e-19cbf3c5f139","badge":{"display":"Best Colleges for Kinesiology and Therapy in America","ordinal":171,"total":378,"vanityURL":"best-colleges-for-physical-therapy"},"content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"Truman State University","type":"College","url":"truman-state-university"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.6769},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":12478},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"1070-1330"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Junior","body":"Truman State University is a school for individuals who are willing to dedicate themselves to their major and academia. The students are academically motivated and are always able to manage their school with friends and family. It is a University that is small, but can offer so many opportunities for students who are motivated to see what the collegiate experience can offer. Overall, the University provides an ideal situation for those who are not aiming for a large campus or large school. Buildings are no more than 10 minutes away from one another and the chances of bumping into someone you know is very high. Students tend to be interactive when walking to classes and it is just a healthy environment for students who are wanting to get to know others in their major and in the dorms and all over campus. I highly recommend Truman State University and any student can get the most from attending this University!","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2017-12-25T23:54:06.166669Z","guid":"0c4f1394-60a3-4560-bd87-fc7d9d5a1f64","rating":5},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":3.66}],"photos":{"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-92.580531,40.188238,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-92.580531,40.188238,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.5279831045406547,"count":947},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Kirksville, MO"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/truman-state-university/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"3e3b4110-0c43-4d56-b5f9-6c060dc07841","badge":{"display":"Best Colleges for Kinesiology and Therapy in America","ordinal":173,"total":378,"vanityURL":"best-colleges-for-physical-therapy"},"content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"University of North Florida","type":"College","url":"university-of-north-florida"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.6453},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":13484},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"1040-1220"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Alum","body":"I am now a graduate of UNF with a B.S. in Biology.

For some reason, it is difficult to get in contact with the office unless one is physically in their office. It is easier to send an email or make a phone call than it is to take a shuttle to the building (in my case). Also, the lines to get a hold of financial aid advisors are extremely long and unorganized.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2017-09-29T12:21:09.675773Z","guid":"b39db05a-243a-4056-8235-264eb22d3ba7","rating":4},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":3.33}],"photos":{"default":{"crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/cd8937ca6bf73b025c02cbc1287855a2d1220b15.jpg","MobileHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/928b1352790a285bdb740794dd9505ea2c0bf5b3.jpg"},"licenseName":"UNLICENSED"},"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-81.773578,26.464262,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-81.773578,26.464262,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.765514184397163,"count":2256},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Fort Myers, FL"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/florida-gulf-coast-university/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"02741a50-d34a-4fc9-9b39-2b29ca6cc871","badge":{"display":"Best Colleges for Kinesiology and Therapy in America","ordinal":181,"total":378,"vanityURL":"best-colleges-for-physical-therapy"},"content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":true,"isPremium":false,"name":"Southern Adventist University","type":"College","url":"southern-adventist-university"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.38262},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":21540},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"920-1180"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Freshman","body":"It's a relatively small campus with about 3,000 students, which means you get to know a lot more peopke on a more personal level. The staff are amazing; they'll invite you over to eat and talk and are always available if you have quesions. The campus itself is sort of tucked away in its own little community and has a nice feel to it. If you like the outdoors it's even better because of the 35+ miles of biking and hiking trails. There are several restaurants on campus that are worked by the students and have a wide variety of food choices. Finally, the spiritual side of Southern is beautiful. Everyone is so welcoming and always has your back. It's a big, beautiful family.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2018-05-10T17:12:58.005846Z","guid":"1f753bc3-d28a-40e8-bce2-e92cdb7accdf","rating":5},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":3}],"photos":{"default":{"crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/45cb79fe27fa02739f7ca4eb22b3a721c9ca4a45.jpg","MobileHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/d335a4b8bf95efce71fa4e813b48d3699ded5bc4.jpg"},"licenseName":"UNLICENSED"},"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-85.050878,35.049136,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-85.050878,35.049136,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.577524893314367,"count":703},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Collegedale, TN"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/southern-adventist-university/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"7d19ae37-bb2c-4ad8-989f-5fd1cd0c45ce","badge":{"display":"Best Colleges for Kinesiology and Therapy in America","ordinal":182,"total":378,"vanityURL":"best-colleges-for-physical-therapy"},"content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"Washington State University","type":"College","url":"washington-state-university"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.7204},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":17815},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"930-1165"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Sophomore","body":"I've never seen a school so filled with pride! It's incredible to be a part of a family that is nationwide. I've been on vacation, states away, and have heard the familiar greeting of \"Go Cougs!\" from passing strangers. One of the most significant things I like to boast about is how safe and clean the campus is; schools in big cities just can't compete with those aspects of WSU. And, as a young woman living across the state in a new and unfamiliar environment, I can't appreciate enough how hospitable Pullman and the WSU campus is. I'll always recommend WSU to those looking to attend college, it's truly an amazing place to pursue postsecondary education.

While it has a very rigorous academic program, the school also provides a range of resource to choose from if a student is ever in need of help, both academically and otherwise. Despite being an open campus, as a cis-female individual I still feel reasonably safe. The campus is small and beautiful, with the state capital building just across the street. The student body shares a close-knit bond that is perhaps even more so than larger schools, due to the smaller undergrad population. Professors and staff are generally very open, accepting, and easy to approach without fear of judgement. It is a very expensive education, but the majority of students receive some sort of financial aid or scholarship. I'm so glad to be fortunate enough to be able to attend this school.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2018-05-18T20:39:06.20624Z","guid":"0f4d17a5-cf3c-4882-af66-e03a836d4ad0","rating":4},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":3.66}],"photos":{"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-123.030727,44.935743,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-123.030727,44.935743,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.601108033240997,"count":722},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Salem, OR"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/willamette-university/#scatterplot"}}]}
