I have learned so much and made so many friends that I will keep in touch with for a lifetime. One of my favorite things about Keuka College is that it is a small campus and everyone you see is a familiar face. You are likely to develop a personal bond with most/all of your professors, and your professors know you by name, you're not just a number. If you are struggling in one of your classes, you can go to your professors office hours and get all of the help you need. Your professors set you up for success, not for failure. The campus is small and everything is within walking distance, which is really nice, especially when you're in a hurry. The college tries their best to offer activities for you to keep you busy, and of course, the lake being right in your backyard is a huge benefit!","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2017-01-24T00:22:25.334457Z","guid":"d489e6a2-8177-4803-9690-b53b0aef2c33","rating":4},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":2.66}],"photos":{"default":{"crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/e7eac12490c47bda531ce5c6250459f21c38535f.jpg","MobileHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/63f2c575d68f4a0a999f9dee228836318833513b.jpg"},"licenseName":"UNLICENSED"},"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-77.090518,42.61541,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-77.090518,42.61541,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.309823677581864,"count":397},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Keuka Park, NY"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/keuka-college/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"0de4b9ec-961d-4915-8869-7496b5688f15","badge":{"display":"Best Colleges in America","ordinal":193,"total":1644,"vanityURL":"best-colleges"},"content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"Rochester Institute of Technology","type":"College","url":"rochester-institute-of-technology"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.5493},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":29111},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"1140-1330"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Freshman","body":"Rochester Institute of Technology was my dream college.

Queens is also a liberal arts school so here we focus a lot on the arts and you are required to take some arts courses because of this, but I loved it; it broadened my knowledge and forced me to take courses that I may not have taken otherwise. Because of the size of the school the ratio of professor to student is along the lines of 1:17, which is great because you are NOT known as just a number here, you are an individual that the Professor actually gets to know. It makes your experience better when you know that your Professor cares about you.

More elevators should be created to accommodate these students.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2018-02-09T20:09:30.673862Z","guid":"319cc8d1-eb75-40cd-ba8d-5633cad5fb26","rating":4},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":3.66}],"photos":{"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-80.377591,25.757111,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-80.377591,25.757111,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.6224571520102513,"count":6243},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Miami, FL"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/florida-international-university/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"9467bfec-0869-4392-9d54-e7d92598d377","badge":{"display":"Best Colleges in America","ordinal":500,"total":1644,"vanityURL":"best-colleges"},"content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"La Salle University","type":"College","url":"la-salle-university"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.7684},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":26772},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"870-1080"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Alum","body":"Overall, I was grateful for the experience La Salle gave me during my undergraduate degree.

I also was able to join a sorority and other clubs La Salle had to offer. I met life long friends and remained in touch with not only students but some professors as well. Only reason I did not give 5 stars was because the school was very expensive when I attended, (graduated May 2016) and I am in a ton of student debt because of it.

Yes, it does get cold, but you are likely the type of person who has been outside enough to cope with the cold if you are going to Paul Smiths. Academically you get to know each of your professors very well. With small class sizes and labs there is a unique hands-on learning experience that other colleges just can’t match.

I would not change anything if I had the opportunity because once you get to know everyone there, you feel like you have found your second home.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2018-04-20T23:28:05.606969Z","guid":"b0a75551-454d-49a1-bcbc-7a8958fbd095","rating":5},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":3}],"photos":{"default":{"crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/78fbe314341ac552cdb7940af169e7c488f5bc10.jpg","MobileHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/8072850e0ee77ff4468886b560d2948e12c329d8.jpg"},"licenseName":"UNLICENSED"},"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-77.128799,38.905552,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-77.128799,38.905552,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.597997138769671,"count":699},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Arlington, VA"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/marymount-university/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"9dd2be00-fed7-4e1e-b9db-34e14185dae4","badge":{"display":"Best Colleges in America","ordinal":279,"total":1644,"vanityURL":"best-colleges"},"content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"Loyola University Chicago","type":"College","url":"loyola-university-chicago"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.7257},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":34934},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"1030-1260"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Senior","body":"Great school to attend.
