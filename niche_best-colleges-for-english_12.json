The small class sizes, the dedicated teachers, and it's the most affordable waterfront place you can find! The only red flag I see from St. Mary's is the limited majors. Lucky for me, I am studying to be a teacher in the St. Mary's five year teaching program. However, not everyone can be so lucky.

SHU has representation from every state in the US and 70 countries. While based in Catholicism, SHU has almost a 50% diversity rate and welcomes people of any faith or belief system. Seton Hall athletics is one of the best parts of campus life. With 14 D1 sports teams there is always a game to watch and cheer on. The men's basketball team plays at the Prudential Center in Newark, NJ and they play in the Big East Conference. Going to basketball games is a highlight of the school year!\nOverall, social life on campus is awesome. There is always stuff to do on campus during the week and the weekends. Greek life is available on campus but will not make or break your experience. Like any school, it all depends on your willingness to put yourself out there - and SHU provides more than enough opportunities to do so. \nAlso, the FOOD is good! There are so many options and they change everyday.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2018-06-04T15:47:01.313883Z","guid":"67c0457c-4298-460b-8f22-c636e1cfaae0","rating":5},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":3.33}],"photos":{"default":{"crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/10c17ac338d092c6f9efeb8f4647806e6133a5e2.jpg","MobileHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/724f3858e89a297148ff496d8377ac95ea1db212.jpg"},"licenseName":"UNLICENSED"},"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-74.248753,40.742859,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-74.248753,40.742859,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.6006984866123397,"count":1718},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"South Orange, NJ"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/seton-hall-university/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"dbd44661-bd7c-4bda-99aa-d85184537739","content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"University of Utah","type":"College","url":"university-of-utah"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.7642},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":11322},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"1050-1300"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Freshman","body":"I love my school!

I appreciate Luther's diversity, with a large international student population, but I often find myself wishing there was more diversity in experience and opinion in my classes. \nWorking with the housing system at Luther was not always the easiest or best experience when trying to manage toxic rooming situations, and think the housing application should be updated, and procedures changed to give students more flexibility.\nOverall, I have had a good experience at Luther, and hope that it will only improve in the years to come.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2018-03-24T19:47:15.968459Z","guid":"0d909646-455d-4fc2-bf14-56e9e4723de3","rating":4},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":4}],"photos":{"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-91.803971,43.313584,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-91.803971,43.313584,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.6958456973293767,"count":674},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Decorah, IA"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/luther-college/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"41ace287-371f-4f87-b901-984815ebb5b5","content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"Massachusetts College of Liberal Arts","type":"College","url":"massachusetts-college-of-liberal-arts"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.771},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":15035},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"890-1130"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Senior","body":"Massachusetts College of Liberal Arts is one of the best state schools in Massachusetts.

Their office hours were always super open to students, and they were some of the friendliest people I have met. Although the school is originally very expensive, they offer many scholarships and loans through financial aid that make attending the university infinitely more affordable. Classes were neither too  easy nor too difficult. They were just enough work to challenge me, but not overwhelm me. If I had any complaints about Hamline, they would fall into the residential life category. My dorm is very old and in need of some renovation. The toilets and showers are always broken, and the elevator does not always work. The size of my room is perfect, though.

I would definitely consider looking at Franciscan if you are looking for a well rounded education and for something that will push you to become a better person.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2018-02-18T22:42:01.873589Z","guid":"c78f70db-f4c1-4478-a85d-217aea2771dd","rating":5},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":3}],"photos":{"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-80.623094,40.376086,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-80.623094,40.376086,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.5127175368139225,"count":747},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Steubenville, OH"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/franciscan-university-of-steubenville/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"3c24e185-57c5-4d0b-9cc1-b506ed690357","content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"Ripon College","type":"College","url":"ripon-college"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.6526},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":20893},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"860-1160"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Alum","body":"I graduated 1.5 years ago, I was accepted to Medical School (MD) right out of college, but as a back-up, I had applied to jobs during my senior year and received 2 high paying offers (greater than 55k + benefits) within 2 weeks. Ripon really prepared me for Medical School and the job market. What really makes Ripon stand out is in connecting students with opportunities to build one's resume in college so they become excellent applicants for post-grad education and in the job market.  You have to actively try to not become involved in research, campus jobs, internships, or other resume building activities, while being a student at Ripon. The fact that I and several of my classmates were accepted into Medical School right out of college is significant. This is becoming increasing difficult to build a sufficient resume to be a competitive applicant after just 4 years of college.

Most professors also send out internship opportunities so students can immerse themselves in that particular field.

They also strive on being active figures in the community, frequently hosting blood drives and potlucks.

I would recommend it to anyone looking for a small school.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2017-10-19T22:33:09.32381Z","guid":"2c5fa681-de65-49d1-ba86-23e82abf1aea","rating":5},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":3}],"photos":{"default":{"crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/c80fadc1717240373575277df83e174c22fed8df.jpg","MobileHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/8d7afc26686d4011d5b46d893b89c9cebc1fe52e.jpg"},"licenseName":"UNLICENSED"},"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-88.138199,30.694751,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-88.138199,30.694751,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.6733167082294265,"count":401},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Mobile, AL"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/spring-hill-college/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"16ec08c6-0ad5-4817-b58b-42466d00882b","content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"Grove City College","type":"College","url":"grove-city-college"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.8247},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":20483},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"1060-1325"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Niche User","body":"Grove City College boasts a central emphasis on the Christian life and worldview. The beautiful campus is enough to make any lover of beautiful historical architecture stand in awe and admiration.  The professors are engaging, intelligent, and extremely accommodating. The food is superb! The students are thoughtful, responsible, and mature in most cases. In addition, the students for the most part prefer to engage one another in conversation rather than absorb themselves in their devices. Overall this College is the perfect place for someone who wants superb education, good friends, good food, and more, all for a very reasonable price.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2018-02-21T13:21:00.736775Z","guid":"2b17bdbd-c150-43c3-91a2-25e87dee9c2e","rating":5},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":3}],"photos":{"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-80.079836,41.157827,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-80.079836,41.157827,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.411832946635731,"count":862},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Grove City, PA"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/grove-city-college/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"f78e217a-fb90-4ff1-87cb-8cc9bbd9e75f","content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"University of Alabama - Birmingham","type":"College","url":"university-of-alabama---birmingham"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.5814},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":16092},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"970-1300"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Graduate Student","body":"I love UAB because you get to experience a world that is extremely diverse! While it is so different in many ways, you are able to bring your own uniqueness to UAB and become apart of their family. They encourage and accept all types of individuals in order to not only support the students attending the school, but support the future of the world. With UAB being able to accept and welcome such a diverse group of individuals it only benefits them more and continues to grow their success, because they learn from each other and grow with each other, making their goal to better society as one family.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2018-05-17T05:55:01.065574Z","guid":"4f54ee84-8dc2-4f65-911f-51a601cb47ff","rating":5},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":4}],"photos":{"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-86.80917,33.50223,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-86.80917,33.50223,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.7142116182572615,"count":1928},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Birmingham, AL"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/university-of-alabama---birmingham/#scatterplot"}}]}
