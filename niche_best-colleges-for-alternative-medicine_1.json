A variety of ages in a diverse ethnic student population allows for a positive learning environment that is open and accepting.

It became a home to me! The campus is beautiful and perfectly placed close to town and other locations with fun events, and the people there are amazing, alongside the food which is always important to consider! Professors are great and willing to work with students during many times of the day, which also goes for the kitchen staff and the admissions office! The dorms are great and super cozy for a college! I miss spending time in the dorm buildings so much! I would do anything to put myself back there with the same group of people for one more night! Overall, I love Johnson State College and would highly recommend it for others!","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2018-02-16T04:48:42.468277Z","guid":"a0fc4231-b34d-4dfe-b7c5-7f6cf6e31ba7","rating":5},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":1.66}],"photos":{"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-72.671154,44.641736,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-72.671154,44.641736,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.1205211726384365,"count":307},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Johnson, VT"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/johnson-state-college/#scatterplot"}}]}
