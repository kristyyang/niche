It's not perfect, but no college is. However, being a freshman, my transition from high school to college has been great. Most professors are super helpful and really like to challenge you. Campus safety is a goal that Rhode Island College strives to make their students feel. There is always RIC security driving through campus and many emergency push buttons all over. Which makes you feel very safe. The campus is small and beautiful and gives a home feeling like no other college I looked into. I am a commuter so I can not say what it is like living on campus. However the one downfall the college has is not enough parking spaces...Like ever. The school is mostly a commuter school which is cool, but parking can be horrendous depending on the time you have classes.

It is in an urban area with a diverse community so I enjoy the atmosphere when I attend classes throughout the day. From experience, I can say the professors and staff are readily available for students during a time of need, whether it is academic or personal. College is what you make it and I am fortunate enough to surround myself with friends who make it such an amazing experience. Being a nursing major, I have a pile of workload so I spend a lot of my time at the library, which is an exceptional place to study in without any distraction. SPU clubs also try to get the students into the school spirit and I can say that there are some fun events that can be attended throughout the school year. Regardless, it is predominately commuter school so many of the students return home after classes end, but it is still possible to make friends on campus!","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2016-07-17T15:11:50Z","guid":"2e815893-7692-496d-a44d-99d2d220a669","rating":4},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":2.66}],"photos":{"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-74.071541,40.727105,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-74.071541,40.727105,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.3712480252764614,"count":633},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Jersey City, NJ"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/saint-peters-university/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"4f36b886-599a-46bb-9861-e309e3a699d5","badge":{"display":"Best Colleges in America","ordinal":763,"total":1644,"vanityURL":"best-colleges"},"content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"Eastern Kentucky University","type":"College","url":"eastern-kentucky-university"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.8633},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":12255},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"930-1140"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Freshman","body":"I have only been here one full semester, but I already love this college.

Rather, its the culture that exists where the school itself is constantly striving to be better, which is why our mascot, the pioneer, is fitting. SHU is constantly pioneering what a college can be.

CU has a small environment that you see familiar faces daily. I feel the professors really care about me. I know I have created relationships that will last a lifetime. I am excited to build stronger relationships next year. I know my faith has grown so much. Being away from my family and developing what I believe is true for myself has been an awesome journey. I have learned to hear from God more. My year was far from perfect. I would describe my first year at Cornerstone overwhelming. The word overwhelming can be a bad thing but can also be a good thing. I learned to let go of many situations and let God. I learned God can turn any bad situation into a good one to bring Him. I am excited for years to come to learn more in the education setting, athletically, with relationships, and with my faith. I have learned so much so far and cannot wait to learn more. Highly recommend Cornerstone!","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2018-05-07T01:04:46.820247Z","guid":"95a14189-b466-41ff-bfb8-2ee16109217b","rating":5},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":2.66}],"photos":{"default":{"crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/fd773fcc92ad89dd479420a1304379d03f2035c4.jpg","MobileHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/bdbd6423ef4276ccc80805c8ee28fae17d0f406c.jpg"},"licenseName":"UNLICENSED"},"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-85.595602,42.979044,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-85.595602,42.979044,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.7414330218068534,"count":642},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Grand Rapids, MI"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/cornerstone-university/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"e51422f8-66c1-4264-a443-3d1545f03924","badge":{"display":"Best Colleges in America","ordinal":845,"total":1644,"vanityURL":"best-colleges"},"content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"University of Mary Washington","type":"College","url":"university-of-mary-washington"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.7445},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":20499},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"1010-1210"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Freshman","body":"The University of Mary Washington is a warm and welcoming school where everyone fits in!

My visit included overnight lodging, meals, but most importantly inclusion in several classes I was interested in taking.  I decided this was the place I wanted to obtain my degree.  While I spent four semesters at community college, all of my credits transferred to Seton Hill.  My advisers have been very helpful in making decisions to class schedule and career choices.  This is an older campus with great atmosphere.  It was very to transition from community college to university.   I plan on obtaining an Art Education degree and am taking full advantage of a three year old arts building which contains not only art studios, but studios for dance.  I would strongly advise anybody to include Seton Hill University on their must see.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2018-02-22T21:44:17.985189Z","guid":"61726ed2-d54f-47da-97e7-856f49aca3d1","rating":4},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":3}],"photos":{"default":{"crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/b06026905218d3c3ca4053c9029856e9e622f6c7.jpg","MobileHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/b2dec240be13299f7548e035000b823cccb5ee7e.jpg"},"licenseName":"UNLICENSED"},"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-79.556228,40.308623,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-79.556228,40.308623,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.6678966789667897,"count":813},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Greensburg, PA"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/seton-hill-university/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"284f501e-1074-4843-8441-a0d73684a675","content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"Chestnut Hill College","type":"College","url":"chestnut-hill-college"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.6447},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":24418},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"850-1070"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Graduate Student","body":"I've had an excellent experience at Chestnut Hill as a graduate student in the Clinical and Counseling Psychology program.
