There are so many different people on campus, and they all have their own amazing passions. The institution provides exposure to many experiences to explore like clubs, GobblerFest, athletics and football games, dorm activities, parties, hiking trails, and even checking out scenic spots on campus and throughout the town.

My only complaint is that I didn't receive as much financial aid as I would have liked, but since I am an in-state student, the price is still manageable.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2018-01-09T21:59:10.146821Z","guid":"6f61dc48-f342-4c17-9fcc-bc7da8644662","rating":5},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":4.33}],"photos":{"default":{"author":"yeungb","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/af8e5289916e3e4d650a316ccb2c3980c2f4e37c.jpg","MobileHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/e08339d8a5308e72b7c4beddb2df0c0cdad8d0d5.jpg","Thumbnail":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/3e8d27dcd48f95494e99b933ba8c516f2fbe1fbb"},"licenseName":"CC BY ","licenseUrl":"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/2.0/","sourceUrl":"https://www.flickr.com/photos/yeungb/9439875304/"},"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-79.050969,35.912165,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-79.050969,35.912165,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.7965641952983726,"count":2212},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Chapel Hill, NC"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/university-of-north-carolina-at-chapel-hill/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"9d9a9977-4c96-45c6-8a12-b8be71a34936","badge":{"display":"Best Colleges in America","ordinal":84,"total":1644,"vanityURL":"best-colleges"},"content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"Brigham Young University","type":"College","url":"brigham-young-university"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.5118},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":12864},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"1160-1380"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Freshman","body":"The school is definitely difficult but very rewarding.

Despite the weather (which I am now used to), I fell in love with Case and the nursing school because of the commitment to intelligence and hands-on learning. When I was in my second week of college ever, I was in the hospital interacting with patients. I even helped save someone's life before my first semester ended. Case shows so much dedication to its students and professors take the time to work with every individual.

The professors are knowledgable and with a smaller campus and small class sizes, you can really get the attention and help you need from your professors. However, Cal Poly struggles with diversity. There are some programs directed to making prospective students of color feel more welcome (such as Poly Cultural Weekend) but overall, people of color make up less than half of the student body. There is even less people of color apart of Cal Poly's faculty. The lack of diversity is also apparent in the town, not just on campus.  If you are coming from a big city to San Luis Obispo, Cal Poly will be a big change. Since it is such a smaller, quieter area, there is not much to do here, especially if you're under 21. That being said, there are a lot of places to hike and hammock if you're a nature lover! The Farmers Market on Thursdays are a popular spot and attract many residents. The beaches are beautiful.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2018-03-17T01:44:31.222074Z","guid":"9ff1f622-a6e1-446a-a07d-cb47c5a415e5","rating":4},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":4}],"photos":{"default":{"crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/d616af4cad52b01bbd8dd743a1d9e0ce6ae6f812.jpg","MobileHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/aca929811f06f81522da2dd062f12da6e2a1c0c7.jpg","Thumbnail":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/1f9a259894aa3b00a7947ed85418992f32b03688"},"licenseName":"UNLICENSED"},"mapbox_header":{"crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-120.65856,35.29889,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-120.65856,35.29889,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"UNLICENSED"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.6969783352337515,"count":3508},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"San Luis Obispo, CA"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/california-polytechnic-state-university---san-luis-obispo/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"09e8cd9a-f401-4c8b-a79c-f02e10ac0201","badge":{"display":"Best Colleges in America","ordinal":42,"total":1644,"vanityURL":"best-colleges"},"content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"University of California - Berkeley","type":"College","url":"university-of-california---berkeley"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.1693},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":17160},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"1270-1540"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Sophomore","body":"Berkeley is just perfect balance between academics and fun!

Their database is incredible and the library has so much information for you to refer to when doing research or completing an essay.

TAMU is also steeped in traditions that make it an incredibly unique college experience!","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2018-05-28T22:47:05.098811Z","guid":"1bcd4563-84cf-49cf-8e39-de2b0186e8dd","rating":5},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":4.33}],"photos":{"default":{"author":"stuseeger","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/ff5729663bd7a54277d74bd8984e13c49ccf7c45.jpg","MobileHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/7d1b079ee81a8a31c0d2ef4ed9a7a70f12598247.jpg","Thumbnail":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/f676617e01732b695d6b17acf63bafcf2e322892"},"licenseName":"CC BY ","licenseUrl":"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/2.0/","sourceUrl":"https://www.flickr.com/photos/stuseeger/1236808146/"},"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-96.340322,30.613226,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-96.340322,30.613226,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.946622579121398,"count":6351},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"College Station, TX"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/texas-a-and-m-university/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"72a78a8a-ede3-4cfd-93af-af3597264db5","badge":{"display":"Best Colleges in America","ordinal":100,"total":1644,"vanityURL":"best-colleges"},"content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"Clemson University","type":"College","url":"clemson-university"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.5054},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":17797},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"1150-1340"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Junior","body":"As a transfer student, I was nervous about my upcoming experience at Clemson. I began to wonder from my previous year of college whether or not college was for me. However, within hours of starting Clemson I began to realize that college here was going to be great.  My professors have embedded within me a love to read, and I have read more books that were not required by my classes, within my two years here, than I had in all of middle school and high school. Even though I did not focus on the social life at Clemson when I first started, I quickly was able to find friends from all backgrounds, some being from various clubs and fraternities, to those on the football team. College game day at Clemson is quite possibly the most exciting sports venue in the United States! Clemson has given me the ability to grow as a person, both academically and socially, and I see myself as being a better man since coming Clemson than I was two years ago before I enrolled here!","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2018-02-26T18:52:02.04411Z","guid":"f168dc56-bd14-406c-afbe-96b454babeda","rating":5},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":4}],"photos":{"default":{"author":"greerjasona","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/866366c511a89c41a22800e481653247a15041da.jpg","MobileHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/92bd9e552f70188d14b8b397043e904e07d8e9d9.jpg","Thumbnail":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/9f3d6145f05e7ee87c4a483379ab7ff1daeb0e44"},"licenseName":"CC BY ","licenseUrl":"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/2.0/","sourceUrl":"https://www.flickr.com/photos/greerjasona/16202933089/"},"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-82.834463,34.677329,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-82.834463,34.677329,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.8071186440677964,"count":2950},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Clemson, SC"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/clemson-university/#scatterplot"}}]}
