It is a small campus so you most likely know everyone in the classroom. The further in your major you get, the more attention and help you will get from your professor because your class size will be so small. The professors seem intimidating in the basic classes because they are trying to \"weed out\" the student who do not belong in the major, but as you progress they are your greatest helpers. The professors just want to see you succeed. As far as campus involvement, there is a lot to do on campus during the week but less on the weekend because it is generally a commuter campus. There are a variety of clubs offered and there seems to be one for everyone, if you cannot find one you can create one!","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2018-02-14T02:43:58.536572Z","guid":"bdcbbc0e-010b-47a4-884f-b0499397ecb6","rating":4},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":2.66}],"photos":{"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-79.535757,40.292824,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-79.535757,40.292824,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.3202416918429,"count":331},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Greensburg, PA"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/university-of-pittsburgh---greensburg/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"ad8533ff-f853-4f8f-b89c-16944b083dad","content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"Northern Michigan University","type":"College","url":"northern-michigan-university"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.7587},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":12667},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"760-940"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Freshman","body":"I am born and raised in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan.

The parking situation is one of them, although they have added multiple lots to help the problem. Another item that could be better is the dining areas.

Which makes you feel very safe. The campus is small and beautiful and gives a home feeling like no other college I looked into. I am a commuter so I can not say what it is like living on campus.

I think I will be equipped and on my way to become an author and a public speaker after completing a degree in communications.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2018-04-24T17:56:15.095979Z","guid":"59ebd44e-f549-4ae2-9e17-58b8ce2f8bf5","rating":4},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":3}],"photos":{"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-90.308886,38.711297,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-90.308886,38.711297,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.44284128745838,"count":901},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Saint Louis, MO"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/university-of-missouri---st-louis/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"e86b1196-1af9-41c3-b6c4-095f12ea1f0a","content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"Eastern Michigan University","type":"College","url":"eastern-michigan-university"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.7288},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":14268},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"910-1140"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Junior","body":"I love this school.  It tends to have a bad reputation, especially from where I come from, but I have nothing but great things to say about it.  Campus culture is very work oriented, many people here are ready to really earn their way to what they want to do.  Eastern is very community based, and that is shown in Ypsilanti, and the kind people around you.  Very diverse student body.  EMU tends to be too focused on the work at times, which is never a bad thing, but we could learn to relax.  You have to work to get the experience that you want.  Don't expect to pay tuition and love it - get involved, talk to your professors, do community service, look into study abroad, talk to your classmates, do research!

I value the academic challenge Toygaloo offers.  Tougaloo is a private historic kept secret and many people are not aware of the opportunity that this great HBC can offer.  The alumni association is also very encouraging and supportive in more ways than one, but I also have to say the campus can use a more modern updated look.  Tougaloo has been around a long time and mostly all funds come from private donors, with that in mind I understand that the funds are used for people like me to be funded for college books, housing and etc and that can be very costly.

It is a wonderful campus, and I am grateful for everyday I get to be there.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2016-03-25T11:44:45Z","guid":"b620ac32-5a1e-4d61-9b82-a3fcb12dcda1","rating":5},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":2.33}],"photos":{"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-86.285313,32.350939,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-86.285313,32.350939,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.6346153846153846,"count":312},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Montgomery, AL"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/huntingdon-college/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"5397fb8a-dbb0-4bcd-8a6d-41da2249323d","content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"Minnesota State University, Mankato","type":"College","url":"minnesota-state-university-mankato"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.6249},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":13812},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"886-1106"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Sophomore","body":"I really enjoy all that the school has to offer in terms of extracurriculars. There’s always intramural sports you can do with teams, and there’s a huge gym and rock climbing wall. There’s always stuff in the student center going on as well. There’s plenty of organizations and clubs to get involved with, as well as Greek life, which I am part of.
