The professors here are okay, the reason why is they are very close-minded and authoritative. You cannot question their judgment, and they are not open to new ideas. The campus buildings and dorms are kept clean and updated - which is a huge plus to recompense their weaknesses. The student life here is dull since most people are commuters and the students only hang around with people from their high school. The food here is from good to average in some days. Finally, the academics here is excellent since it has tons of academic variations along with professors that are passionate about their specialized field. All in all, it is a great university!","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2018-02-15T08:51:05.921577Z","guid":"f40471ec-bf6b-4505-8722-41ae61551a3b","rating":4},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":3}],"photos":{"default":{"crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/5e2e951c3244d7c28ea08295d241080c6aa40fcb.jpg","MobileHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/801ab8e3233e1b781a4f8acbe3cadbb9a0302269.jpg"},"licenseName":"UNLICENSED"},"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-74.199455,40.859233,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-74.199455,40.859233,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.463615903975994,"count":2666},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Montclair, NJ"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/montclair-state-university/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"c3ea35a9-85d8-473b-a511-4f7d71c3b78e","content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":true,"isPremium":false,"name":"North Carolina State University","type":"College","url":"north-carolina-state-university"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.4751},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":13066},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"1170-1350"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Junior","body":"One thing that I love about North Carolina State University is the amount of diversity and school pride here on campus. The people here at State are so welcoming and friendly towards one another that it is easy to find someone to study with, party with, or just become friends with overall. I think NCSU has one of the best engineering and communication programs here on campus and they also have a lot of resources at our libraries and everywhere else on campus. Their database is incredible and the library has so much information for you to refer to when doing research or completing an essay. This University has a strong reputation of academic success as well competitive students, which is makes our school very exciting. Each student is engaged and passionate about something and NC State encourages that each student pursue those goals.

There are numerous tutoring services and most professors are flexible with their office hours to find a time that works for the student.  Almost everyday there's a different activity happening on campus, from goat yoga and Pinterest parties for stress relief, to live music and food to spend time with friends, to tailgates before sports games to support our Wildcats with the most spirit.

The courses are time consuming and require one to put in effort, however, that is to be expected.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2018-02-26T17:11:03.574724Z","guid":"5c1d81d1-44b2-4f9d-9a47-d54c82edea0e","rating":5},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":4}],"photos":{"default":{"author":"australianshepherds","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/0a7353227b597d0237ebba5ffa47cfc57bc75ef0.jpg","MobileHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/bbcae5c41985e4040071cb88e4d68e4954091cb9.jpg","Thumbnail":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/1c809b30dab4ec34e87a06bcca0a324041dd06b6"},"licenseName":"CC BY-SA","licenseUrl":"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/","sourceUrl":"https://www.flickr.com/photos/australianshepherds/4515942319/"},"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-85.492409,32.600201,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-85.492409,32.600201,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.8747056052755533,"count":2123},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Auburn, AL"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/auburn-university/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"4ddcc361-a1f9-4bd6-b3ad-360f06549d5f","content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"Virginia Commonwealth University","type":"College","url":"virginia-commonwealth-university"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.8115},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":20544},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"980-1200"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Alum","body":"I attended VCU 2008-2012 and don't regret it at all! It is not a typical college campus with brick buildings and grassy fields. It's nestled in the city of Richmond where you have a diverse and dynamic mix of students, city dwellers, artists, and everything you can imagine! I would never trade this for another \"typical\" school. In terms of academics, everything is accessible through student tutoring sessions, group review sessions (highly advisable). It's challenging (especially if you do the Honors College), but worth your while. THe study abroad programs are EXCELLENT. I did 2 of them myself, and definitely recommend it-- they find a way to finance whatever study abroad you want to do, through their scholarship office. \nI only take 1 star away because I was a commuter and did not enjoy VCU as much as the residential students. However, the commute is also highly doable and there is a lot of parking available to students. Honestly, VCU is the way to go.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2018-05-01T08:37:43.300365Z","guid":"f71873d8-b412-454c-be0c-5f8da8fc5baa","rating":4},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":3.33}],"photos":{"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-77.453597,37.547631,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-77.453597,37.547631,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.6626812515899263,"count":3931},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Richmond, VA"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/virginia-commonwealth-university/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"1df7ed07-f4dd-4337-9218-ebc15894b39b","content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"University of Texas - San Antonio","type":"College","url":"university-of-texas---san-antonio"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.7641},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":12107},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"920-1130"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Sophomore","body":"The University of Texas at San Antonio is a great place to obtain a higher education due to the good student- to-teacher ratio, the extremely helpful professors, and the friendly campus atmosphere.

The professors are knowledgable and with a smaller campus and small class sizes, you can really get the attention and help you need from your professors. However, Cal Poly struggles with diversity. There are some programs directed to making prospective students of color feel more welcome (such as Poly Cultural Weekend) but overall, people of color make up less than half of the student body. There is even less people of color apart of Cal Poly's faculty. The lack of diversity is also apparent in the town, not just on campus.  If you are coming from a big city to San Luis Obispo, Cal Poly will be a big change. Since it is such a smaller, quieter area, there is not much to do here, especially if you're under 21. That being said, there are a lot of places to hike and hammock if you're a nature lover! The Farmers Market on Thursdays are a popular spot and attract many residents.

I would recommend UNL to any prospective college student.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2018-01-11T20:43:26.480298Z","guid":"ac972c2e-9420-40e7-9ee7-f3e0a11b9263","rating":5},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":4}],"photos":{"default":{"author":"ivyfield","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/dcb2fb513e8b6d533b4a4991f0cef81323fb1bde.jpg","MobileHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/4690d091f954f63a1c9b504057710be089e888d2.jpg","Thumbnail":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/43295d3eedc379e04f35377371efecce49167e67"},"licenseName":"CC BY ","licenseUrl":"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/2.0/","sourceUrl":"https://www.flickr.com/photos/ivyfield/6986330897/in/album-72157603879379896/"},"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-96.702177,40.822272,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-96.702177,40.822272,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.674708818635607,"count":2404},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Lincoln, NE"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/university-of-nebraska---lincoln/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"eab48e37-afef-49f3-a5c9-c3b7b5571e43","content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"George Mason University","type":"College","url":"george-mason-university"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.8099},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":18032},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"1060-1250"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Alum","body":"I graduated from GMU in May 2017 and I can confidently say that GMU set stepping stones in order for me to pursue my dreams in going into dental school.

Whether it be an intro class or a more fine-tuned 400-level class, each professor that has given a lecture to me has granted me the opportunity of hearing new insight and viewing the world in a fresh perspective. \n\nI resided in Ellicott Complex, which served as shelter for my first-year experience.

A lot of opportunities for internships, leadership positions and involvement. A lot of research opportunities and very good professors as well, especially for a public university. Despite the perception, OU is a lot more than just football and greek life. However, I would recommend that after freshman year, you live somewhere within walking distance to campus, because the parking here is absolutely awful and you will absolutely regret commuting to campus and spending nearly 2 hours looking for a parking spot everyday, even with a parking pass that costs hundreds of dollars. Also Dale Hall is a ridiculous building and if you have a class there, get there early because trying to make your way through the crowds in that building can sometimes take a while. The parking situation & Dale Hall is the only thing preventing me from giving this great school 5 stars.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2017-11-06T00:20:34.290457Z","guid":"75f25a4a-6e57-4df8-b0a2-0b3897295b1c","rating":4},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":4}],"photos":{"default":{"crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/6a7d7e2d5c708a009e6b4857db0d69cf2efb39c4.jpg","MobileHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/eeb1688e862a426894b97137be0e4145307a7a24.jpg","Thumbnail":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/0dfb8859200ebd86bfb0acaf4b7740bcc6822455"},"licenseName":"UNLICENSED"},"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-97.445692,35.208152,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-97.445692,35.208152,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.7810136157337366,"count":2644},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Norman, OK"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/university-of-oklahoma/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"72a78a8a-ede3-4cfd-93af-af3597264db5","content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"Clemson University","type":"College","url":"clemson-university"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.5054},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":17797},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"1150-1340"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Junior","body":"As a transfer student, I was nervous about my upcoming experience at Clemson. I began to wonder from my previous year of college whether or not college was for me. However, within hours of starting Clemson I began to realize that college here was going to be great.  My professors have embedded within me a love to read, and I have read more books that were not required by my classes, within my two years here, than I had in all of middle school and high school. Even though I did not focus on the social life at Clemson when I first started, I quickly was able to find friends from all backgrounds, some being from various clubs and fraternities, to those on the football team. College game day at Clemson is quite possibly the most exciting sports venue in the United States! Clemson has given me the ability to grow as a person, both academically and socially, and I see myself as being a better man since coming Clemson than I was two years ago before I enrolled here!","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2018-02-26T18:52:02.04411Z","guid":"f168dc56-bd14-406c-afbe-96b454babeda","rating":5},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":4}],"photos":{"default":{"author":"greerjasona","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/866366c511a89c41a22800e481653247a15041da.jpg","MobileHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/92bd9e552f70188d14b8b397043e904e07d8e9d9.jpg","Thumbnail":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/9f3d6145f05e7ee87c4a483379ab7ff1daeb0e44"},"licenseName":"CC BY ","licenseUrl":"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/2.0/","sourceUrl":"https://www.flickr.com/photos/greerjasona/16202933089/"},"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-82.834463,34.677329,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-82.834463,34.677329,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.8071186440677964,"count":2950},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Clemson, SC"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/clemson-university/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"3ed520d7-0315-4f25-b696-562531d896d3","content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"University of Texas - Rio Grande Valley","type":"College","url":"university-of-texas---rio-grande-valley"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.6393},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":4432},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"850-1050"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Freshman","body":"I love UTRGV because it's so close to my own house. If you're looking for a college that'll ensure you get your basics done and career into Engineering/Nursing, then this school is the one! The people I've met at UTRGV aren't the best individuals, but the ones that stick around in your life are the real treasure here. The culture here is very friendly and despite me working part-time here, all my 'customers' are nice and friendly and very patient with New comers! The teachers you meet show that they actually put genuine thought and belief into the subject that they teach, unlike most Highschools you recently get out of. The people you meet with when assigned for groups actually care about their grade, so I doubt you'll find much slackers trying to sink the group down by not contributing. It's a small college though, but I'm okay with it!","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2017-11-13T20:47:08.203495Z","guid":"7c15031e-64ae-4195-9d22-8447c482eb4f","rating":4},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":3}],"photos":{"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-98.172112,26.306629,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-98.172112,26.306629,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.6126924871675223,"count":2143},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Edinburg, TX"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/university-of-texas---rio-grande-valley/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"76ef9c66-beb9-4ad6-b413-b995d78a9a4c","content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"University of Delaware","type":"College","url":"university-of-delaware"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.695},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":15894},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"1060-1280"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Senior","body":"This school provides me with countless opportunities to get involved with clubs that I'm interested in.
