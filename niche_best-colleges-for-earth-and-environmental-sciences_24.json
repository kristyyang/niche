You know almost everyone there and everyone there is very friendly. The campus stays very clean year around, the yard people keep it very clean and presentable. The professor’s there are very understanding and helpful. They allow you to come visit them during office hours, other schools aren’t that close with their students. Most of my professors see me around campus and remember my name. The campus food there is very delicious and there are lots to chose from. The dorms are very widespread and clean. The bathrooms stay clean very often. Everything is great about Bridgewater college, were getting a new library soon which will just add to this great school.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2018-05-02T18:12:44.431897Z","guid":"d3855fd2-912b-4f6d-af3f-f84cafb67517","rating":4},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":3}],"photos":{"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-78.969011,38.378391,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-78.969011,38.378391,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.481675392670157,"count":382},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Bridgewater, VA"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/bridgewater-college/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"16ad3693-4652-4128-b70e-552f45df211d","content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"Indiana University - East","type":"College","url":"indiana-university---east"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.6028},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":8548},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"830-1040"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Senior","body":"IU is a great college offering the convienence of online classes to finish degree.  The professors are top notch and always willing to give you your time.  Online courses are tough but their curriculum makes it tolerable.  The professors are easy to reach and provide ease to contact if needed.  There are writing labs and math labs available 24/7.  My experience at IU has been more than pleasant.  I have two classes remaining and would recommend IU to anyone interested in online classes. Because I live in Nashville, TN,  it was hard to be involved with any campus activity, but, from what I see in emails, IU has plenty of activities and always step up to help their local community.  Again, I would recommend Indiana University to anyone wanting to take online classes!","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2018-05-01T11:59:25.255252Z","guid":"3a099b19-cf4b-4d2a-954f-a9701f1192e6","rating":5},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":2.66}],"photos":{"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-84.886187,39.867099,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-84.886187,39.867099,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.6619718309859155,"count":284},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Richmond, IN"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/indiana-university---east/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"06666c39-6e59-4521-8779-9114e0db10a2","content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"Oklahoma Baptist University","type":"College","url":"oklahoma-baptist-university"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.6011},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":18968},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"920-1165"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Niche User","body":"Oklahoma Baptist University is very great when it comes to taking care of their students, whether academically or financially.

The campus is small and everything is easily accessible, no running across massive campus to get from class to class. The class sizes were small so it allowed for Professors to teach on a more personal basis. The professors were almost all  fair and excellent as well, there was only one I would complain about but is no longer employed. The people are friendly, however the population did not seem very diverse. There were plenty of places to relax or study as a commuting student, and parking spaces were not too bad to locate for the most part. Classes were challenging but practical and allowed for great preparation.

Otherwise the building(save Torres) are pretty good and sturdy though Torres has some of the newer technology. Socorro itself is fairly barren but it has the base needs of a student body. overall its a good school but you need to know what you are doing before you make major decisions, as soon as you can ask your adviser for some introductory tips as the school does not really inform the students of what they need to do from time to time.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2017-08-16T15:32:03.555652Z","guid":"6a57d1b1-d24c-4db6-bb4e-dfb7955ea33c","rating":4},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":3.66}],"photos":{"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-106.907491,34.066035,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-106.907491,34.066035,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.497098646034816,"count":517},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Socorro, NM"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/new-mexico-institute-of-mining--and--technology/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"d8a18ac9-0e33-430c-bc78-4e69c5681ff4","content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":true,"isPremium":true,"name":"Reed College","type":"College","url":"reed-college"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.3131},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":27805},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"1280-1480"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Alum","body":"I graduated from Reed recently and I now work in financial services in NYC.

There seems to be something available for everyone. \nThere are also various opportunities to play a varsity sport or participate in intramural sports. \nThe classes are challenging and push you to think.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2016-12-30T22:11:15.977123Z","guid":"1bd43040-a390-4e63-a0d0-c363bfb2fa6c","rating":5},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":3}],"photos":{"default":{"crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/7339d4a8ac93166e0c31f2ad07c5f8274499863a.jpg","MobileHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/2a9b8969b390a1a7d49f6ab7ed829b24c8c3ba1c.jpg"},"licenseName":"UNLICENSED"},"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-93.563471,41.365503,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-93.563471,41.365503,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.5278688524590165,"count":305},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Indianola, IA"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/simpson-college/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"4755f8e4-ceeb-4aa3-a493-893bc7e3dd79","content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"Sul Ross State University","type":"College","url":"sul-ross-state-university"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.9222},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":14095},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"730-949"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Junior","body":"It is an amazing school!
