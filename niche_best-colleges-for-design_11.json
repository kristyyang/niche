I studied sport management and all the professors in my department have real-world experience in the industry which is important.  We have a state of the art fitness center which has anything you can imagine, and probably more. Going to varsity games is fun and the dining halls are decent. If you like to party, youll love Cortland even more. There is always a reason to go out and drink with your friends and the bar scene is legit. If youre not a partier, thats cool too, there is always SO much going on campus youre sure to have fun without drinking. The city itself is a neat, they recently received a 10 million dollar grant to renovate downtown. Huge economy boost. Syracuse's Destiny mall is a half hour away and SUNY Cortland sponsors trips to go there so if you or your friends dont have a car, you’re good. Ithaca is 25 minutes away and is a very cool town, theres trails to hike and its great if you just want to get away from Cortland for the day","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2018-02-08T20:55:20.899402Z","guid":"7edfedbc-29a7-45b9-82ee-3edf1f1d12d4","rating":4},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":2.66}],"photos":{"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-76.197909,42.590158,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-76.197909,42.590158,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.55484693877551,"count":784},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Cortland, NY"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/suny-cortland/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"2b3e0dea-5255-4fa4-af03-4a14bb5889f0","content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":true,"isPremium":true,"name":"New Jersey Institute of Technology","type":"College","url":"new-jersey-institute-of-technology"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.593},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":15406},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"1110-1310"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Junior","body":"For a university that has a lot of diversity of students from all types of ethnic background you name.

Other than that, WTAMU is a great place to further your education!","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2017-09-11T03:13:20.639737Z","guid":"0ca97aa7-210c-474b-9fd1-8b00eeb8e580","rating":4},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":3}],"photos":{"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-101.9158,34.981996,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-101.9158,34.981996,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.6172381835032437,"count":1079},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Canyon, TX"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/west-texas-a-and-m-university/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"4ef1542a-a42e-4171-9e6a-b7f4124898a0","content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"East Stroudsburg University of Pennsylvania","type":"College","url":"east-stroudsburg-university-of-pennsylvania"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.8335},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":16377},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"840-1040"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Junior","body":"East Stroudsburg University was actually on my back-up school list when I started applying to colleges. When I visited campus for the first time, I knew this was the college I was going to be deciding on. The size of campus is perfect for a student who has always been in a small high school. Campus is very much together; you could walk to all of your classes. There's a shuttle bus that runs every 15-20 minutes that will take you around campus when you're feeling lazy or the weather is bad. The faculty members I've experienced the past 3 years I've been there have been AMAZING. I've met the most knowledgeable individuals at the Psychology Department. They are my favorite and most loved department at ESU! The dorms and housing are constantly improving which makes it hard to pick a hall to live in. The only thing I would like to see improve at ESU is the food vendor.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2017-01-09T21:37:25.688977Z","guid":"de759054-8287-422a-ae44-fb0e9857980a","rating":4},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":2.33}],"photos":{"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-75.172614,40.99622,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-75.172614,40.99622,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.373231773667029,"count":919},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"East Stroudsburg, PA"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/east-stroudsburg-university-of-pennsylvania/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"2c61d1b3-13b0-45db-87df-f3df02787d3a","content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"University of Denver","type":"College","url":"university-of-denver"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.5347},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":32940},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"1110-1310"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Freshman","body":"The extra opportunities at DU are fantastic!

I refused to research the school because I did not believe Winthrop was the place for me; however,  I toured the campus about three years later.  One reason why is because of the campus's size. In my opinion, Winthrop is a smaller Clemson. Furthermore, the student ratio is 15:1. Another reason is the convivial atmosphere. Winthrop's faculties are organized, easy to find, and productive. For example, the student center has over four different restaurants and the workers are nice. The staff occupying these places such as the recreation center, bookstore, and admissions office are welcoming, helpful, and friendly.

The campus is a very inviting environment; there are always events going on whether it is sports, diversity, or arts. The professors give off a warm, caring  aroma. No student should be afraid to ask for help from their professor; they are always willing whether it is through office hours or email. MSUM offers many ways to help students succeed; from tutoring to the Wellness Center for physical health. The campus is just the right size, not too small yet not overwhelming as well. As soon as I visited MSUM my senior year of high school, I knew it was home. Though, what I would like to see change is the exclusion from some activities held on campus. For example, they have activities that exclude some students from clubs or learning communities. I wish for more equality in allowing all students to be involved. Otherwise, I believe MSUM is a great place full of opportunities for students to further their education.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2017-11-26T05:07:52.397844Z","guid":"0ece1c33-a37d-4bed-abe0-cadcfc074cbc","rating":4},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":3}],"photos":{"default":{"crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/db9b3a0ff27f272424f505083bf388c9377f84cd.jpg","MobileHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/9579f183666104e0e7185a4591a4b5f6878c5147.jpg"},"licenseName":"UNLICENSED"},"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-96.763376,46.866482,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-96.763376,46.866482,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.4360795454545454,"count":704},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Moorhead, MN"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/minnesota-state-university-moorhead/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"8dba5571-9c2b-4c81-9db6-14b9cbbdb67b","content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"SUNY Fredonia","type":"College","url":"suny-fredonia"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.6235},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":16622},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"900-1120"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Sophomore","body":"I like Fredonia for the most part, I live off-campus, and I think the student life seems rather dull, outside looking in.

The professors are very knowledgeable and hold a sincere passion for their fields. I enjoy the fact that students and professors are able to connect personally, so you can really get to know each other. This makes getting references much easier! The opportunities are an additional reason why I enjoy attending WOU. As a psychology major, I have an opportunity to be a research assistant, a teacher's assistant, or both! This provides an opportunity to experience those positions, and determine if they are areas that I want to pursue. WOU also has many activities and clubs, this is great because you can get to meet so many new people. One complaint I have is the advising available at WOU. I would enjoy more being able to sit with my advisor and create an academic plan instead of using an online system that tracks courses and credits.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2017-02-24T21:48:30.011242Z","guid":"ad59a95b-dfc8-4494-a2f2-4e26154f50c0","rating":5},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":2.66}],"photos":{"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-123.238785,44.851866,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-123.238785,44.851866,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.533333333333333,"count":975},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Monmouth, OR"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/western-oregon-university/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"df08b6b6-abc3-4281-910e-40845aeeee5d","content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"Keene State College","type":"College","url":"keene-state-college"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.8253},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":18647},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"880-1070"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Alum","body":"Keene State College is accepting of students from all walks of life.

After visiting Simpson, Drake, and other private Midwest four year institutions I must say that Creighton's Campus just felt like home.  The professors are all supportive and with a small student to teacher ratio, I feel like an actual person in their classes and can build a relationship with the professors.  The food is excellent, Godfather's Pizza, Chinese, Latin American, Sushi, Burgers, and buffet styled mess halls are a good indication of the different food at Creighton.  The dorms are a little on the dated side, yet they have modern amenities.  The older buildings really gives the place a theme and a warm glow.  Everything is nice and compact seeing that this campus is in the middle of Omaha and all of my classes are within 10-15 minutes of one another.  The advisors are always courteous and listen to the students needs and wants.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2018-05-31T18:36:22.198929Z","guid":"7cb7e8b5-ca43-4732-8bc5-2aa9bae9ad48","rating":4},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":3.66}],"photos":{"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-95.947029,41.265325,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-95.947029,41.265325,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.591194968553459,"count":954},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Omaha, NE"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/creighton-university/#scatterplot"}}]}
