The campus is small and everything is easily accessible, no running across massive campus to get from class to class. The class sizes were small so it allowed for Professors to teach on a more personal basis. The professors were almost all  fair and excellent as well, there was only one I would complain about but is no longer employed. The people are friendly, however the population did not seem very diverse. There were plenty of places to relax or study as a commuting student, and parking spaces were not too bad to locate for the most part. Classes were challenging but practical and allowed for great preparation. I graduated with my Bachelor of Science from Lasell with great satisfaction, and I am even planning to return to Lasell for my graduate degree this coming fall.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2018-02-26T22:09:26.153315Z","guid":"e3b4a2f0-8ffd-48ea-92bb-866a5db0f0b5","rating":4},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":2.33}],"photos":{"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-71.243738,42.342712,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-71.243738,42.342712,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.413870246085011,"count":447},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Newton, MA"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/lasell-college/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"1dc41e93-6d36-4a50-aa69-daa3bc2acc4a","content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":true,"isPremium":true,"name":"Lynn University","type":"College","url":"lynn-university"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.817},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":36530},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"870-1040"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Junior","body":"Great University.

I play soccer, so I started my first year a week earlier than regular students. My team and I formed a brotherhood and share a bond like no other. We had a great season which featured playoff appearances as a team, and individually, I started every game and scored two game winning goals as a freshman. My coach put lots of faith in me. In the classroom, professors were very involved and seemed to care a lot more than typical college professors. I finished with a 3.6 GPA. The campus is beautiful and small. I know probably half of the student body. There are only two negatives about Alvernia Alvernia is the #1 school in Pennsylvania and #4 in the nation for student debt.

I love it! This was the only school I found that fits perfectly with my wants and needs. I only go to campus once a week and the rest I can do online. It is speedy so I will be able to earn my BBA by 2020. And all the teachers and staff are super friendly and helpful. They are a little more expensive than most schools but I figured since I'll be in debt either way, might as well go for the best!","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2017-07-10T22:52:57.230083Z","guid":"eb75edb5-a9a9-4d25-9682-ffe62c064f1d","rating":5},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":2.66}],"photos":{"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-84.568923,39.022963,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-84.568923,39.022963,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.5408163265306123,"count":196},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Crestview Hills, KY"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/thomas-more-college/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"f4bac55f-4769-4b8c-b9b1-825e2bb94453","content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"St. Francis College","type":"College","url":"st-francis-college"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.6414},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":14830},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"830-1030"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Sophomore","body":"St. Francis is an amazing college.

I would highly not recommend it because the thing about this college is that we are family here, you'll be surrounded by quality friends whom you can create the best of memories with if you choose to be involved with them. This is a college that is very accepting of people from all different walks of life.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2017-04-25T03:57:10.120751Z","guid":"b12f79de-ee32-4358-a052-2b62cc7f9628","rating":5},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":2.33}],"photos":{"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-80.56916,40.204594,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-80.56916,40.204594,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":2.7969924812030076,"count":266},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Bethany, WV"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/bethany-college---west-virginia/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"043e56ee-4b71-4f07-9d82-ceec0a7bfcb0","content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"Culver-Stockton College","type":"College","url":"culver-stockton-college"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.5812},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":19747},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"850-1000"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Niche User","body":"I am planning to enroll at Culver-Stockton College in Fall 2018 and I have only had positive experiences with it so far!

Things like the food served in the commons, certain professors, and some academic changes need upgraded. However, even though it has all of these things that most students complain about, Graceland is a diverse school! People come from all over the world just to go to Graceland and get their degrees!
