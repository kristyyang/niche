If you're wondering just how close of a relationship you make with the staff at Averett - my advisor has a picture of us hanging in her office from my senior pinning, and when going through a hard time in a leadership role, the president wrote me an encouraging handwritten letter.

They won’t pursue you, you need to pursue them periodically in person to see if anything is amiss.

Another thing I like about it is, they offer a bridge program with the University of Kansas so you can take classes there at a cheaper price than actually going to KU.

You form long lasting friendships with a lot of students. Class sizes are small. The professors want to see you succeed and are willing to help. The dorms are ok. The food has gotten better over the last year or so. The athletic facilities are great for a small school and are D2. The school is next to the city of Elkins and is walking distance to restaurants etc.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2018-02-12T03:56:21.384536Z","guid":"5d9def64-184e-405e-a66d-a357e271fc82","rating":4},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":2.66}],"photos":{"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-79.846391,38.928693,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-79.846391,38.928693,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.4865900383141764,"count":261},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Elkins, WV"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/davis--and--elkins-college/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"17f86430-9942-4854-9f45-e87f329c29a7","content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"Greensboro College","type":"College","url":"greensboro-college"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.3625},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":26305},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"800-1010"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Freshman","body":"Greensboro College is a small campus where the students know pretty much everybody.

The professors are well-experienced, intelligible, and strive to make amazing artists out of their students. The class sizes are typically small, ranging from 15-25 students per class. Depending on your chosen course, classes can be mostly hands-on; usually, liberal arts classes are the only classes that are textbook, notes and lecture-only. Classes span from 2-D arts, such as Illustration and Painting, to 3-D arts, like Ceramics, and media-based arts, such as Animation and Film.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2016-06-16T19:18:41Z","guid":"7b91d3a3-4929-4424-aa86-3809452401ff","rating":4},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":2.66}],"photos":{"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-94.583594,39.046353,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-94.583594,39.046353,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.5665529010238908,"count":293},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Kansas City, MO"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/kansas-city-art-institute/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"b3264f8f-584a-481f-ace0-c9c63e8224a2","content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"Cincinnati Christian University","type":"College","url":"cincinnati-christian-university"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.9241},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":19961},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"773-1071"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Senior","body":"CCU is a great University for people of any faith.
