My only prominent complaint is all of the construction on campus. Maneuvering through the dirty sidewalks and the one-way streets outlined in cones can be annoying.

Campus is small, and the closest 'big town' is about ten minutes away, but you can always find things to do and people to do them with if you try hard enough. If you don't think a big school is for you, then SAU might be a good option!

On several occassions I have had a professor encourage me to pursue research and professional opportunities that I am interested in that will improve community outreach outcomes.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2017-10-03T05:16:18.816293Z","guid":"2bd819ab-6286-44c7-95c4-4c93f67ddbff","rating":5},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":3}],"photos":{"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-122.637944,45.568242,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-122.637944,45.568242,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.7531645569620253,"count":632},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Portland, OR"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/concordia-university---oregon/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"30b9069e-7dcd-4207-a085-77d8a863ee29","badge":{"display":"Best Colleges in America","ordinal":815,"total":1644,"vanityURL":"best-colleges"},"content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"University of Sioux Falls","type":"College","url":"university-of-sioux-falls"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.9149},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":20316},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"960-1160"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Alum","body":"I loved my experience at the University of Sioux Falls.

If you want to start a project, do research, get internships, or help out in the community, you have to have some initiative but it pays off. I got a really cool internship through the career services and completed a fulfilling work-study.\n\nI took classes and electives in several departments outside my major, including education, communication and psychology, and I gained a lot of practical knowledge. Professors are intelligent, funny, and made learning feel less like work. Definitely recommend the senior capstone project required by several majors because it gives you the research and writing skills needed to do a master's thesis project closely supervised by faculty.\n\nStudent body is quiet but has a lot of neat interests and passions. The college could do more to bring that out, but there's a lot of potential.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2017-07-11T18:37:09.679548Z","guid":"476b0a9b-ac4a-420c-b193-a7b5d224093b","rating":5},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":2.66}],"photos":{"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-81.251817,41.717841,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-81.251817,41.717841,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.4285714285714284,"count":175},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Painesville, OH"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/lake-erie-college/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"eff5b7b3-1cd4-420c-854f-3268e5f3903b","badge":{"display":"Best Colleges in America","ordinal":775,"total":1644,"vanityURL":"best-colleges"},"content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":true,"isPremium":false,"name":"Longwood University","type":"College","url":"longwood-university"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.7395},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":18835},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"870-1070"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Freshman","body":"Longwood is a great school that offers much to its students.

It was fun and a good leg work out too! Also, the local areas for food is quite amazing. When needing to eat besides campus food, there is a wide variety of different ethnic food here. What I like to see a change in Humboldt is to give a more housing chances for students that are from far away. More housing in the campus for everyone to be. It is tough to find an apartment or house near the school and have the housing costs to be low, for future students coming from different parts of California or an out of state transfer, they should have the opportunity to have a low-cost housing and a secure home to be in.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2018-06-04T07:47:55.941084Z","guid":"69c3f499-369e-44c2-b940-7c35a6e57796","rating":4},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":3}],"photos":{"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-124.0814,40.8741,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-124.0814,40.8741,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.5448863636363637,"count":1760},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Arcata, CA"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/humboldt-state-university/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"556c6afe-6763-4a0a-8194-b0eb4cac7519","content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"Lindenwood University","type":"College","url":"lindenwood-university"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.5469},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":22183},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"920-1130"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Junior","body":"I love Lindenwood because I have made an experience out of my time here. I knew I needed to get involved on campus in order to make friends, have fun, and get the college experience that I want! Overall, my Major and Minor professors (art and education) have been excellent. The Gen Ed teachers are alright, some are amazing and some should probably be fired. Campus life and party life are good for me because I am a social person. Food is alright. Spellmann is great with Sushi, Chic-fil-a, Qdoba, etc., but you never know what you're in for at Evans. It's hard to be healthy at this school. The campus is beautiful, and if you make friends easily like me, you don't have a problem with the commuter culture.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2017-07-25T22:21:25.446621Z","guid":"5447a269-12fd-4ec9-96e8-0f593198b4e5","rating":4},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":2.66}],"photos":{"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-90.502825,38.788203,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-90.502825,38.788203,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.5039893617021276,"count":752},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Saint Charles, MO"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/lindenwood-university/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"18a7f8f9-c4d7-4e9a-8e69-b6d292d7d2b4","content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"Barton College","type":"College","url":"barton-college"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.4088},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":21293},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"850-1040"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Freshman","body":"I love the staff and the campus.
