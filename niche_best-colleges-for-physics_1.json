Here are they:\n1. My first choice is chemical engineering and I always adored to conduct researches in laboratories. Therefore, when I applied to colleges first of all I looked if they have a good undergraduate research opportunities. In MIT with the help UROP I could start researching even from freshman class.\n2. Its pass no record style of educating freshmen. There is no grading in the first semester. Instead, one gets \"Pass\" or \"Fail\" in his or her transcript. It allows students not to stress too much on grades, but explore the university and majors.\n3. Of course it is the best university in the field of chemical engineering. Top notch professors, smart peers and the best laboratories makes MIT unique.\n4. It's financially available for all international students. MIT's need blind policy makes it affordable for all who want to attend it.\n\nI hope it helps!","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2017-12-28T19:46:12.988166Z","guid":"6a2f1b8a-1afe-4ef8-944b-b2dd08d2ab87","rating":5},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":4.33}],"photos":{"default":{"author":"justinjensen","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/9e4d828e5f5cfe5eac16bdee876a58919082288f.jpg","MobileHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/3dbd39d4c1401beb7773c38566cc4d728d7db4ed.jpg","Thumbnail":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/557facfa37e7e3a49d452635d811fd839d0145b2"},"licenseName":"CC BY ","licenseUrl":"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/2.0/","sourceUrl":"https://www.flickr.com/photos/justinjensen/4979561102/in/album-72157623671307590/"},"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-71.092115,42.360095,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-71.092115,42.360095,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":4.078859060402684,"count":596},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Cambridge, MA"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/massachusetts-institute-of-technology/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"2beca607-a07e-40a3-b6ae-c23b64decb5d","badge":{"display":"Best Colleges for Physics in America","ordinal":3,"total":135,"vanityURL":"best-colleges-for-physics"},"content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"Harvard University","type":"College","url":"harvard-university"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.054},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":16205},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"1430-1600"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Alum","body":"Harvard University offers the most incredible experience for its students.

I cannot begin to tell you the opportunities available here nor what you will learn from working and studying alongside people from all over the world.

The campus is coated in blossoming trees, while the buildings are old yet renovated inside. The air is cool and moist, but not humid like southeast Texas.\n\nAnother thing I enjoy is the commitment to sustainability, especially in projects abroad and the dining hall food. The Princeton Environmental institute does classes with local farmers using a variety of methods and chefs from many culinary backgrounds.\n\nWhat I like most about Princeton is the community. My host and his friends had endless intellectual and personal discussions and readily invited me into their part of Princeton.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2018-04-23T23:02:51.480973Z","guid":"c54a3eae-4cbe-4e4e-ad93-03dfb8aff562","rating":5},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":4.33}],"photos":{"default":{"author":"jal33","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/2560fd4b6044a1d64d87f709238cb73aa93957ab.jpg","MobileHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/d7c980bcd685c0ba6da7438478031d28aa6603f5.jpg","Thumbnail":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/646c0aa45e7ecd12528654d08332cc99a20c651e"},"licenseName":"CC BY ","licenseUrl":"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/2.0/","sourceUrl":"https://www.flickr.com/photos/jal33/16215204421/"},"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-74.663708,40.348496,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-74.663708,40.348496,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.9037974683544303,"count":395},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Princeton, NJ"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/princeton-university/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"20a0947f-4d4c-4c36-8e94-bf0a2ba50e4f","badge":{"display":"Best Colleges for Physics in America","ordinal":7,"total":135,"vanityURL":"best-colleges-for-physics"},"content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":true,"isPremium":true,"name":"University of Chicago","type":"College","url":"university-of-chicago"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.08},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":31068},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"1450-1600"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Alum","body":"It's nice to see that the University has increased campus diversity of financial aid resources for families that will make the campus more diverse in terms of student backgrounds.

Getting a job after graduating from Mudd is easier and very rewarding.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2018-04-10T08:23:25.197021Z","guid":"7c5241f4-9924-4fc6-81c1-3a57d2358930","rating":5},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":4.33}],"photos":{"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-117.710594,34.106137,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-117.710594,34.106137,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.6589147286821704,"count":129},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Claremont, CA"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/harvey-mudd-college/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"09e8cd9a-f401-4c8b-a79c-f02e10ac0201","badge":{"display":"Best Colleges for Physics in America","ordinal":14,"total":135,"vanityURL":"best-colleges-for-physics"},"content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"University of California - Berkeley","type":"College","url":"university-of-california---berkeley"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.1693},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":17160},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"1270-1540"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Sophomore","body":"Berkeley is just perfect balance between academics and fun!

To conclude, I recommend the University of Michigan to anyone willing to work hard, expand their mind and anyone who wishes to fulfil their dreams!","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2017-08-18T13:59:38.243587Z","guid":"8a0693f7-3b4e-4072-b125-b3e202abf528","rating":5},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":4.33}],"photos":{"default":{"author":"andrewfhart","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/081ad508fc336e85ac7df09a1b94910da147dec4.jpg","MobileHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/7fe1d364ff04eb75849442df6c7ae3879a1a7ca4.jpg","Thumbnail":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/3baabafb4eda12741729d6acdec95b2609483d89"},"licenseName":"CC BY-SA","licenseUrl":"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/","sourceUrl":"https://www.flickr.com/photos/andrewfhart/9487931632/"},"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-83.74313,42.276172,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-83.74313,42.276172,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.8437183383991895,"count":3948},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Ann Arbor, MI"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/university-of-michigan---ann-arbor/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"66d370e2-6bbb-4e64-bff6-d719a0ddb2cb","badge":{"display":"Best Colleges for Physics in America","ordinal":21,"total":135,"vanityURL":"best-colleges-for-physics"},"content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":true,"isPremium":true,"name":"Carleton College","type":"College","url":"carleton-college"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.2262},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":28587},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"1320-1540"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Sophomore","body":"Carleton is a great liberal arts school with professors that care about the students as well as students that care about the students.

It’s not necessary to be Catholic and people who aren’t religious at all won’t feel excluded, but it is especially amazing for people who are religious. I myself am not very religious but was raised in the faith and do appreciate it, so I enjoyed being around it and taking the required Theology and Philosophy courses. Everyone is extremely nice and collaborative! Very smart people here and caring professors. Single sex dorms is a negative as well as less opportunities for medical professions, as there is no hospital or medical focus here. I would say it’s best for business, engineering, or liberal arts.
