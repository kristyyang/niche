The professors are top notch and always willing to give you your time.  Online courses are tough but their curriculum makes it tolerable.

I have two classes remaining and would recommend IU to anyone interested in online classes. Because I live in Nashville, TN,  it was hard to be involved with any campus activity, but, from what I see in emails, IU has plenty of activities and always step up to help their local community.

There are always opportunities to get involved and get active on campus. If you show effort, the teachers will meet you half way. They are very willing and open to assistance.

I was proactive about scheduling so for me, it was easy to get the classes I wanted at the times I wanted. However, they have yet to begin online registration methods but word around is that we should have it for next fall. One set back is that the business office and financial aid offices are not very efficient and are not always on the same page. I had to keep going back and talking with both of them to get one simple thing done that turned out to be a slack on their part. Also, there seems to be some unnecessary general education classes, but that is expected being though that this is a Christian, private school. Other than that I have had a fine time here.

Faulkner has a great support team who is willing to help the students resolve issues that may occur during their studies while at Faulkner. I believe that Faulkner looks out for the best interest of its students, helping them to succeed and meet their potential goals in life. Faulkner keep their students informed on all activities that are happening on campus and want all students to be included becoming a well community, while studying at Faulkner. The one thing that I don’t like about Faulkner would be that my commute to campus is an hour and a half drive from where I live other than that I think Faulkner is a great place to study.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2018-02-28T19:44:47.774881Z","guid":"b23e6ad9-9055-4c78-b450-e619a3551260","rating":4},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":2}],"photos":{"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-86.21641,32.384181,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-86.21641,32.384181,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.7533333333333334,"count":300},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Montgomery, AL"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/faulkner-university/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"1f7c509c-df6f-44b1-98e7-f6eca4834b89","content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":true,"isPremium":false,"name":"Georgia Southwestern State University","type":"College","url":"georgia-southwestern-state-university"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.6818},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":12453},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"870-1060"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Freshman","body":"I have only been here a semester but everything is great.

The bookstore has several versions of required reading materials along with leisurely reading materials. Clothing and snacks are available there as well. Purchases can be made with cash or credit, or digital money on any one student's account. Diversity is also a large concern with the school. Many students from many backgrounds attend Eastern Oregon University because of the school's persistent work in recruitment.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2018-01-31T13:49:44.321551Z","guid":"ae6f30ad-1696-4fb1-b9cf-1b2379300b2f","rating":4},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":2.33}],"photos":{"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-118.09384,45.320392,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-118.09384,45.320392,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.607843137254902,"count":357},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"La Grande, OR"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/eastern-oregon-university/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"49bd665f-653c-47fb-ac5c-05bb07252170","content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"Louisiana State University - Shreveport","type":"College","url":"louisiana-state-university---shreveport"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.8857},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":8274},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"905-1086"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Niche User","body":"In itself, this college is very small but is home to interesting unique features.
