The campus is small and everything is easily accessible, no running across massive campus to get from class to class. The class sizes were small so it allowed for Professors to teach on a more personal basis. The professors were almost all  fair and excellent as well, there was only one I would complain about but is no longer employed. The people are friendly, however the population did not seem very diverse. There were plenty of places to relax or study as a commuting student, and parking spaces were not too bad to locate for the most part. Classes were challenging but practical and allowed for great preparation. I graduated with my Bachelor of Science from Lasell with great satisfaction, and I am even planning to return to Lasell for my graduate degree this coming fall.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2018-02-26T22:09:26.153315Z","guid":"e3b4a2f0-8ffd-48ea-92bb-866a5db0f0b5","rating":4},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":2.33}],"photos":{"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-71.243738,42.342712,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-71.243738,42.342712,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.413870246085011,"count":447},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Newton, MA"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/lasell-college/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"f4c2d74f-0133-44ed-8034-2911272beaab","content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"Campbell University","type":"College","url":"campbell-university"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.81},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":25483},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"920-1130"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Freshman","body":"This is my first year in college and I just finished my first semester with lots of great memories and lessons.

You really start to feel at home there because of the family you build and comfort of the town. There's lots of school spirit and fun themed days to boast moral like hot coco day, peanut butter and jelly day, Popsicle day, and so much more. There's little spots to eat around town and lots of hiking opportunities. The professors are kind and easy to talk to. The small class size is one of my favorite things because all of my professors know my name and we form a nice student teacher relationship. I would chose my school a million times over again due to the unique small town features, great professors, beautiful scenery, and school activities.

As recently reported on the news, my community has recently undergone a traumatic occurrence at the local mall ten minutes away. Eight people were stabbed, none of which were students at the university, and the assailant was killed on site. Since this, the community has really come together to work through this difficult time. Within the past few days, the school has offered many opportunities for gatherings in which students and faculty could find some light in this time of darkness. The school genuinely cares.

The professors in my department have been very helpful and friendly with everything and the professors do care about their students. They do want to help when you have a problem and do care about their students. There is a lot of work, but it actually teaches you and the lectures are very engaging due to the small class sizes. Even though I do live at home and commute, I do feel at home in this area and at this school.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2018-01-04T16:25:40.92854Z","guid":"bce6d1ce-651c-4c80-8856-86ec0a6f479f","rating":4},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":2.33}],"photos":{"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-74.832775,40.848693,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-74.832775,40.848693,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.3544776119402986,"count":268},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Hackettstown, NJ"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/centenary-college---new-jersey/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"aeea046f-f16a-4a0c-9fbc-ee76f994f6fc","content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":true,"isPremium":false,"name":"Shippensburg University of Pennsylvania","type":"College","url":"shippensburg-university-of-pennsylvania"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.8831},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":18342},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"870-1070"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Sophomore","body":"Shippensburg University is a wonderful university! The program for those interested in becoming educators is phenomenal as well as the business programs. Students are provided with many opportunities to build partnerships with future employers and other students through internships. There are also plenty of activities for students to participate in, as well as a concert venue on campus (H Ric Luhrs PAC) which provides great entertainment year round.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2018-01-08T21:05:07.836006Z","guid":"3c5f86b5-c265-4101-9909-fe69bc7389a6","rating":4},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":2.66}],"photos":{"default":{"crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/c02dca423f37be5f20b33b8932fb9fa3d002e62f.jpg","MobileHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/a0f089286dcd71d0dcbdcfccb6970f17b48415a9.jpg"},"licenseName":"UNLICENSED"},"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-77.5229,40.057405,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-77.5229,40.057405,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.4408602150537635,"count":930},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Shippensburg, PA"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/shippensburg-university-of-pennsylvania/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"7022462c-523e-4bae-be82-c22da11dae8a","badge":{"display":"Best Colleges in America","ordinal":596,"total":1644,"vanityURL":"best-colleges"},"content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"Kent State University","type":"College","url":"kent-state-university"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.8536},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":18180},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"950-1160"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Sophomore","body":"I love Kent State! Having just finished my first year at this amazing university I believe I am able to give a reasonable review. Starting with the pros, Kent State has an amazing resource system. ANYTHING you need, Kent State has or can point you in the right direction of someone who has it or how you can even start it yourself. Kent State has amazing faculty and staff that I believe are truly there to help you. From custodians to our president, I have had nothing but great experiences. Our sports/recreational teams and facilities are top tear or currently being renovated to get there. Kent State is always improving and trying to be the best. Cons, being that it is such a huge university parking can be a hassle and the walking can be tiresome. There is a wide range of people there so of course a few aren't going to be the most pleasant. All in all I truly enjoy Kent State and cannot wait to further my education here!","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2018-06-01T17:49:42.813234Z","guid":"39f3ef2a-d3d1-494b-aa89-597fc41c0276","rating":5},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":3}],"photos":{"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-81.342253,41.146856,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-81.342253,41.146856,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.588814210273644,"count":4166},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Kent, OH"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/kent-state-university/#scatterplot"}}]}
