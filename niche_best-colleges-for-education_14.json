The classes that I have taken have completely shaped me into the person I am today. The professors and peers that I have worked with are incredible and inspiring. People tend to shrug off private colleges because of the cost, but they really work with you on tuition. My only cons are that the registrar's office and the campus security office can be very unfriendly.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2018-05-08T22:05:43.816528Z","guid":"679fccee-0ad1-4427-995d-c94f2f4e195f","rating":5},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":3}],"photos":{"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-123.200464,45.201333,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-123.200464,45.201333,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.4957142857142856,"count":700},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"McMinnville, OR"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/linfield-college/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"aa378d78-d44c-4980-abb6-7cd54df60533","badge":{"display":"Best Colleges for Education in America","ordinal":358,"total":756,"vanityURL":"best-colleges-for-education"},"content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"Hardin-Simmons University","type":"College","url":"hardin-simmons-university"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.8799},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":19338},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"920-1140"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Alum","body":"I attended HSU from 2013-17 & I loved being an HSU student!\n\nThe class sizes are small so I got to know my peers and professors well.

I was actually faced with the opportunity to transfer to another school that would be closer to home, but I just couldn't bring myself to doing it because this school did not compare to Andrews. \nAnother thing about Andrews is that it is very diverse--that is one of the major things that I enjoy the most. I have many friends from the united states, Brazil, Rwanda, Kenya, China, Russia and many other people.
