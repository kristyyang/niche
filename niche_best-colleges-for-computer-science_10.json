This is college, not high school, you don't need to impress anyone. Most kids grew up in the area all their lives and have known each other forever, so it certainly is a bubble.

I would never trade this for another \"typical\" school. In terms of academics, everything is accessible through student tutoring sessions, group review sessions (highly advisable). It's challenging (especially if you do the Honors College), but worth your while. THe study abroad programs are EXCELLENT. I did 2 of them myself, and definitely recommend it-- they find a way to finance whatever study abroad you want to do, through their scholarship office. \nI only take 1 star away because I was a commuter and did not enjoy VCU as much as the residential students.

I'm a sophomore now, and I love how open the campus is, and how there's a huge fountain by the lecture centers. When it's warm out, it's fun to hang out with friends by the fountain. Also, there's a lot of resources to help you choose your major, like the living-learning communities (which I was a part of freshman year). The university also helped me to study abroad in London!","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2018-03-20T20:09:06.06807Z","guid":"6d40422b-5676-47eb-aae2-5d88ec23dc8a","rating":5},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":3.33}],"photos":{"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-73.825014,42.686917,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-73.825014,42.686917,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.4414542020774315,"count":2118},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Albany, NY"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/university-at-albany-suny/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"d8183760-7ab8-44e9-9f89-e149bf4e942f","content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"North Carolina A&T State University","type":"College","url":"north-carolina-a-and-t-state-university"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.5364},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":9548},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"850-1010"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Senior","body":"North Carolina A&T was not my first choice, but I am delighted I chose this school. I have networked with so many individuals and made a lot of life-long friendships. I didn't, however, feel challenged until my junior year of college which is unfortunate, but that may be different with some people. Some teachers really took interests in helping students while others didn't. With academics and professors, I feel could be better along with the food options as well.

I was a history major and loved the professors. The classes were largely discussion based learning and put Cal Ploy's motto to the test: learning by doing. The professors encouraged collaborative learning and engaged every class meeting. The department as a whole was helpful and invested in learning and in the students. I am going into teaching to expose future generations to this style of learning and engagement. I am current in the single subject teaching program, and wish they would offer a credential program that in blended with a master's program in education. A huge disappointment, since a lot of universities do offer such programs.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2017-08-10T03:48:37.714462Z","guid":"88fe80ef-13e4-4c72-80a0-6dacddcad432","rating":4},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":3}],"photos":{"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-117.819019,34.054273,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-117.819019,34.054273,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.547645125958379,"count":2739},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Pomona, CA"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/california-state-polytechnic-university---pomona/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"396a7833-3261-4b0e-ba73-ca3a037316b0","content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"University of Idaho","type":"College","url":"university-of-idaho"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.7589},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":14787},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"930-1170"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Junior","body":"The University of Idaho is great place to get an education. I have gone to both Washington State University and the University of Idaho, and I believe the University of Idaho gives students a very high chance to succeed. I love the University of Idaho because to the faculty and staff, you are not just a number like you are at larger schools such as WSU. These people here actually care about you and take the time to get to personally know you and understand you and try and get the most out of you. Another thing is, professors at UI do all they can to help you find internships and jobs because they actually care and want everyone to succeed. I would highly recommend the University of Idaho.
