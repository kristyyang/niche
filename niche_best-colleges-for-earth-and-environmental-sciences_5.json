Whether it's research or internships or pursuits fo further education, proactive St. Olaf students have many resources they can take advantage of. The curriculum is tough no matter what department you take courses in. Professors have extremely high expectations for their students, however they do everything in their power to build your way to those high expectations. It can be difficult to find a study/social life balance. If you cannot develop strong study habits, classes will be a struggle. There are a ton of resources available to students who haven't established study habits and professors are happy to work with students. The open-door policy is an awesome thing to take advantage of. There can be a sense of a competitive atmosphere, but usually there is a stronger sense of community and camaraderie between students because everyone is facing many of the same challenges in an academic sense.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2017-12-29T06:15:09.010955Z","guid":"0327f163-663c-474f-aa4e-9a560bc27a1d","rating":4},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":4}],"photos":{"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-93.183633,44.462884,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-93.183633,44.462884,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.617862371888726,"count":683},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Northfield, MN"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/st-olaf-college/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"7e141db4-0980-4a41-bd79-79dfa262d674","badge":{"display":"Best Colleges for Environmental Science in America","ordinal":108,"total":382,"vanityURL":"best-colleges-for-environmental-science"},"content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"Hendrix College","type":"College","url":"hendrix-college"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.771},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":22777},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"1100-1360"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Junior","body":"Hendrix College has incredible academics, passionate professors, excellent extracurricular opportunities, a strong alumni network, and a friendly, yet competitive, atmosphere.

Hendrix College can be way too stressful at times, but at the end of the day, there are plenty of resources to help those in need of stress relief. The student housing for underclassmen, however, is abysmal. The dorms are not in the best shape, but there are plans to renovate in the next 5 years. The student Quad is better, yet the walls are so thin you can hear the student above you sneezing. The apartments are better, but they are sometimes a crap-shoot.

Overall, BYU is a great school academically and socially.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2018-02-26T20:59:11.668466Z","guid":"4bfad887-814a-4cbd-8e15-8f16a82d1b85","rating":4},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":4.33}],"photos":{"default":{"author":"victorbjorklund","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/876bded21cdb84307b8d9d0d577d1c911b4fd924.jpg","MobileHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/dde3bf295b4118e68166b5a6fa531e67e250d813.jpg","Thumbnail":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/9cf2902d5faa495838ea7902fa0fe202f9e9baf3"},"licenseName":"CC BY ","licenseUrl":"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/2.0/","sourceUrl":"https://www.flickr.com/photos/victorbjorklund/11342478446/"},"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-111.649281,40.250851,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-111.649281,40.250851,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.9596942321056288,"count":7195},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Provo, UT"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/brigham-young-university/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"04c2f950-cb5f-4785-a8fc-dad897becd6d","badge":{"display":"Best Colleges for Environmental Science in America","ordinal":111,"total":382,"vanityURL":"best-colleges-for-environmental-science"},"content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"Beloit College","type":"College","url":"beloit-college"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.6986},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":25790},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"1065-1370"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Niche User","body":"We visited Beloit on a Open House Saturday and came away very impressed.

We talked to an absolutely lovely, thoughtful, and engaging student who was not part of the admission team to get her take on the school.

Greek life on this campus to me is one of the best in the country and one of the most wonderful organizations I've had the opportunity to be apart of. It not only provides an inclusiveness towards other organizations and the campus as a whole, but encourages students to work harder in both academia and community service. Along with Greek life this university has also provided many leadership opportunities that I wouldn't have had, had I gone somewhere else. While diversity on this campus tends to be lacking I was able to work with different multicultural organizations to change that aspect.

The Philosophy department is one of the best in the country and the German department is fairly small but offers a variety of courses. I was also fortunate enough to study abroad in Germany through Rutgers. There are  scholarship opportunities to offset expenses, and my experience was incredible! The bus system used to transport students from one campus to another is unfortunately sub-par. The drivers take frequent and long breaks, which inconveniences students trying to get to class. A majority of buses themselves don't seem to be well maintained, either, and the bus schedule is unreliable. The quality and variety of the dining hall food is OK, depending on which you go to. There is a lot of cultural and racial diversity on campus, and many different types of course studies, clubs, events, etc. to choose from. Over all, Rutgers is a pretty good school, but one should always be prepared for annoyances.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2018-05-30T18:21:16.015754Z","guid":"01a39b76-f2d9-4942-99de-dbfff1bfa771","rating":4},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":4}],"photos":{"default":{"crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/63edd28c8b5adced9098fd93cc2044f1a1013b1e.jpg","MobileHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/ac486ae5a7a7c83d89cc83347b9440903d55d122.jpg","Thumbnail":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/ab0e0070a7e3c8308c08484d2c5a901dd37b097f"},"licenseName":"UNLICENSED"},"mapbox_header":{"crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-74.45051,40.503796,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-74.45051,40.503796,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"UNLICENSED"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.5708023632551935,"count":5247},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Piscataway, NJ"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/rutgers-university--new-brunswick/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"f3315e60-decf-4d24-9051-86c3a287a693","badge":{"display":"Best Colleges for Environmental Science in America","ordinal":119,"total":382,"vanityURL":"best-colleges-for-environmental-science"},"content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":true,"isPremium":true,"name":"Trinity University - Texas","type":"College","url":"trinity-university---texas"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.4066},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":28569},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"1160-1370"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Sophomore","body":"I am an international student at Trinity.\n\nTrinity has furnished me with countless great memories.

The professors are also very considerate and appreciate actually interacting with students one-on-one. We have a really helpful Writing Resource Center where students who have taken Pedagogy in Practice are assigned as Student Writing Assistants; this helps students feel a lot more comfortable with sharing their writing because the SWAs are students too. Our Counseling and Wellness Center is so helpful for both physical and emotional concerns- they were actually part of the reason I made it through this year, the other part were the professors.

I love seeing the diversity here at MSU, and at the same time realizing that we are all here for one goal, and that is being taught to be well-rounded professionals for “the real world”.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2018-04-13T19:30:25.532473Z","guid":"89d45621-9f52-41bc-b46c-9c9bee3a797c","rating":5},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":4}],"photos":{"default":{"crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/c0937e3ef5ea37e17fe1c8fe728abe009ee6ecc4.jpg","MobileHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/f5136c486c1d7aee0938da37d874c8f2c90d108e.jpg","Thumbnail":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/ade2bf07163c70dccd621ad6a5ced5dd4ff0ce24"},"licenseName":"UNLICENSED"},"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-88.78834,33.455241,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-88.78834,33.455241,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.843767011431682,"count":1837},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Mississippi State, MS"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/mississippi-state-university/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"6fc3bda8-3fc1-432a-bb6d-7aeb8e83610a","badge":{"display":"Best Colleges for Environmental Science in America","ordinal":125,"total":382,"vanityURL":"best-colleges-for-environmental-science"},"content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":true,"isPremium":false,"name":"California Polytechnic State University - San Luis Obispo","type":"College","url":"california-polytechnic-state-university---san-luis-obispo"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.2949},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":18530},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"1150-1360"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Sophomore","body":"Cal Poly SLO is known for their great engineer and agriculture programs. The professors are knowledgable and with a smaller campus and small class sizes, you can really get the attention and help you need from your professors. However, Cal Poly struggles with diversity. There are some programs directed to making prospective students of color feel more welcome (such as Poly Cultural Weekend) but overall, people of color make up less than half of the student body. There is even less people of color apart of Cal Poly's faculty. The lack of diversity is also apparent in the town, not just on campus.  If you are coming from a big city to San Luis Obispo, Cal Poly will be a big change. Since it is such a smaller, quieter area, there is not much to do here, especially if you're under 21. That being said, there are a lot of places to hike and hammock if you're a nature lover! The Farmers Market on Thursdays are a popular spot and attract many residents. The beaches are beautiful.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2018-03-17T01:44:31.222074Z","guid":"9ff1f622-a6e1-446a-a07d-cb47c5a415e5","rating":4},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":4}],"photos":{"default":{"crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/d616af4cad52b01bbd8dd743a1d9e0ce6ae6f812.jpg","MobileHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/aca929811f06f81522da2dd062f12da6e2a1c0c7.jpg","Thumbnail":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/1f9a259894aa3b00a7947ed85418992f32b03688"},"licenseName":"UNLICENSED"},"mapbox_header":{"crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-120.65856,35.29889,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-120.65856,35.29889,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"UNLICENSED"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.6969783352337515,"count":3508},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"San Luis Obispo, CA"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/california-polytechnic-state-university---san-luis-obispo/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"6504f1ee-d47c-44e5-a611-cf344b3effb9","badge":{"display":"Best Colleges for Environmental Science in America","ordinal":126,"total":382,"vanityURL":"best-colleges-for-environmental-science"},"content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"Lewis & Clark College","type":"College","url":"lewis--and--clark-college"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.5495},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":35849},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"1190-1370"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Senior","body":"The most obvious advantage about attending Lewis & Clark is that you get to learn and spend time on a gorgeous campus!

It is a large, beautiful campus, but the class sizes are relatively small. Even lecture halls have under 100 students. In my time at UNCW I grew close to many professors, and even was a TA. The only downfalls to this campus were parking and wifi. I had no other negative experiences. It is a fast growing school and I wish I didn't have to leave to go to grad school (they don't have physical therapy). In-state tuition is very reasonable, and I did not end up out of college drowning in debt. Overall, I would recommend uncw to anyone.
