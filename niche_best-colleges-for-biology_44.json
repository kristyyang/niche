Smaller. Smarter. The classes are small which I believe hold up to no more than 40 students per class. That which is an advantage, and not only because you get to communicate with your Professor consistently but also because Wesleyan is awesome! They have a variety of clubs and organizations that help and assist students involve themselves in activities and internships!  Our staff members involve themselves as much as possible in order for students to find their right major. We are a big family , regardless of how small we are. Also, I will never get tired of saying this... Everyone is nice. Texas Wesleyan is a diverse, fun and successful University. We have late night activities, for example, bonfires, cookouts, \"Naked but Real\", (students come out to share there art pieces including poems, songs etc.) sand volleyball, free shirts, free meals on occasions and tea!

Vanguard is filled with bright life's willing to take on the world with the sole flame of Jesus with-in them. If there was anything that should be changed with-in Vanguard it is definitely towards the food being provided. It is not that the food is bad, it just could be better. If all a campus needs to improve is foodservice, they must be doing something right. Vanguard is a home to many people who have discovered who they are.

If you are struggling in one of your classes, you can go to your professors office hours and get all of the help you need. Your professors set you up for success, not for failure. The campus is small and everything is within walking distance, which is really nice, especially when you're in a hurry. The college tries their best to offer activities for you to keep you busy, and of course, the lake being right in your backyard is a huge benefit!","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2017-01-24T00:22:25.334457Z","guid":"d489e6a2-8177-4803-9690-b53b0aef2c33","rating":4},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":2.66}],"photos":{"default":{"crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/e7eac12490c47bda531ce5c6250459f21c38535f.jpg","MobileHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/63f2c575d68f4a0a999f9dee228836318833513b.jpg"},"licenseName":"UNLICENSED"},"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-77.090518,42.61541,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-77.090518,42.61541,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.309823677581864,"count":397},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Keuka Park, NY"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/keuka-college/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"99bacc0c-67ee-4cda-ad86-96fb2f03ed53","content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":true,"isPremium":false,"name":"American International College","type":"College","url":"american-international-college"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.6931},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":20362},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"762-990"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Alum","body":"I believe the academic offerings and the price of education are very good.

While on campus, many of the staff members will get to know you by name, not as a number. To me, it is really important to recognize students and call them by name, as it makes you feel important.

But then again, I am an international student who's not used to American foods.\nIf you're planning to pursue a computer related degree, you'll have a hard time finding better university than this, at this affordable price and level of education.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2017-10-28T20:49:31.647715Z","guid":"71e60542-cf2d-408f-bf0d-5fc1d39ef603","rating":4},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":2.66}],"photos":{"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-97.109609,44.0127,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-97.109609,44.0127,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.5102880658436213,"count":243},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Madison, SD"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/dakota-state-university/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"513a2adf-8b84-4977-b07a-116c8c29813d","content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"Ferrum College","type":"College","url":"ferrum-college"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.7202},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":17670},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"770-960"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Senior","body":"I have enjoyed my time at Ferrum College from the beginning to the end, honestly. It's a great campus and a supportive community, for the most part. Majority of the buildings on campus are very old, but it seems as though some of the housing buildings are the only true indication of the campus' age. Overall the campus is a safe place, but I would like to see better management of the school's more personal cases (such as Title IX cases) and how they protect the survivors after the dust settles. I would also like to suggest starting incoming freshmen out with advisors in their fields of study, if a major has been decided upon. It would make figuring out the requirements for their majors less confusing, than to be switched around so often and risking being able to graduate on time due to lack of credits required.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2018-05-31T19:15:46.749877Z","guid":"24c0b829-00b2-4318-a915-34137ffea789","rating":4},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":2}],"photos":{"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-80.020864,36.926648,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-80.020864,36.926648,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.3839285714285716,"count":336},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Ferrum, VA"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/ferrum-college/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"348ffb9b-df94-4eab-9fc7-46478c965b17","content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"Mars Hill University","type":"College","url":"mars-hill-university"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.5674},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":17170},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"840-1040"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Junior","body":"Personally I love mars Hill. Although they need to work on the cafe food, they have renovated a lot of the buildings and more plans to continue. The area is great, it's close to downtown Asheville and other places and the views almost everywhere are so gorgeous! The professors are very good depending on your major. One of the major problems is when you try to transfer credits, Mars hill doesn't do a good job with transferring credits in or out. They are big on athletics and over half of the student population are athletes. I give Mars hill a thumbs up because I've thoroughly enjoyed my experience here and I would recommend this school to others!","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2017-03-10T17:30:17.315285Z","guid":"3f015577-a6f5-4fc9-819a-57855e8bca24","rating":4},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":2.33}],"photos":{"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-82.550859,35.825858,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-82.550859,35.825858,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.2576923076923077,"count":520},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Mars Hill, NC"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/mars-hill-university/#scatterplot"}}]}
