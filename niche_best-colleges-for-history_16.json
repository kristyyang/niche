Staff are always willing to help students and make them feel like they're at home. Professors are approachable and are always willing to hear what you have to say. There's tremendously unique experiences that NMSU provides for students. Aside from experiences there's also different kind of activities and organizations where I can find a perfect match to what I like to do and people just get to collaborate with one another. There's over 180+ degrees in NMSU to pick from and just the fact that they had the perfect match to the degree that I wanted to pursue. A couple of things that I think the campus needs to work on is the dorms on campus, there's always something negative that's happening whether is the water, undistinguished smells, door locks.

The professors are well-experienced, intelligible, and strive to make amazing artists out of their students. The class sizes are typically small, ranging from 15-25 students per class. Depending on your chosen course, classes can be mostly hands-on; usually, liberal arts classes are the only classes that are textbook, notes and lecture-only. Classes span from 2-D arts, such as Illustration and Painting, to 3-D arts, like Ceramics, and media-based arts, such as Animation and Film.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2016-06-16T19:18:41Z","guid":"7b91d3a3-4929-4424-aa86-3809452401ff","rating":4},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":2.66}],"photos":{"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-94.583594,39.046353,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-94.583594,39.046353,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.5665529010238908,"count":293},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Kansas City, MO"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/kansas-city-art-institute/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"dc24c3d4-310d-475f-8637-b2a18f38af11","content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"Bellarmine University","type":"College","url":"bellarmine-university"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.8245},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":24742},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"980-1160"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Freshman","body":"Bellarmine University has a great reputation for the business school.

For its low cost, the education you can receive here is outstanding. With myriad departments run by doctoral professors, the opportunities for success and engagement do not end. I have been able to find multiple internships in my field and connect with opportunities for advancing my education after MCLA thanks to my advisors. I have no complaints about this school at all!","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2017-07-18T11:23:05.66849Z","guid":"7e1f2c4a-eced-4a86-bbdb-6b2724b4959c","rating":5},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":2.33}],"photos":{"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-73.1035,42.692427,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-73.1035,42.692427,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.076586433260394,"count":457},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"North Adams, MA"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/massachusetts-college-of-liberal-arts/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"634346a9-f929-49aa-bbae-508f8f112cb2","content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"University of Louisiana - Lafayette","type":"College","url":"university-of-louisiana---lafayette"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.511},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":10200},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"940-1180"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Sophomore","body":"I applied to the University of Louisiana at Lafayette as soon as I received my ACT scores in the mail.
