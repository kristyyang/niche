Classes are relatively small, perhaps 25 maximum for a general education course or something else that's popular, but it's not unusual to have only 6 or seven in more major-specific elective-type courses. This allows you to be very friendly with fellow classmates and faculty, and really be able to understand what needs to be done and exactly how to do it, or at least have the option of quickly approaching your professors. It's located in a charming little town, but also close enough to both Scott Air Force Base and St. Louis to fulfill most needs. My only qualm is the old science building, because it needs some better desks (and it's only that particular building). Also may-or-may not be haunted.\n\nGood for people who want a relatively quiet place where you can still interact with plenty of people but can actually get your work done and learn something worthwhile.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2017-05-05T17:14:14.465182Z","guid":"092199f4-bf7a-4863-80d5-bb9931ee8852","rating":4},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":3}],"photos":{"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-89.814486,38.609431,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-89.814486,38.609431,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.4759725400457664,"count":437},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Lebanon, IL"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/mckendree-university/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"dc1370cf-bf67-4e0b-92fe-32f27f45ea71","badge":{"display":"Best Colleges for Business in America","ordinal":435,"total":1020,"vanityURL":"best-colleges-for-business"},"content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"McDaniel College","type":"College","url":"mcdaniel-college"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.7807},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":23329},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"980-1210"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Freshman","body":"I am a social work major, and I love the program.

You will find organizations that match your views and hobbies, and classes that fit what you're looking for.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2018-04-20T01:02:55.34154Z","guid":"ec1e87f9-464c-4db5-92c3-5307b2c387d7","rating":4},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":3.33}],"photos":{"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-77.001662,39.584879,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-77.001662,39.584879,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.4177852348993287,"count":596},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Westminster, MD"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/mcdaniel-college/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"dedaee55-c30e-4ad8-9db7-9f868e5e4813","badge":{"display":"Best Colleges for Business in America","ordinal":436,"total":1020,"vanityURL":"best-colleges-for-business"},"content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"Carroll College","type":"College","url":"carroll-college"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.7148},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":25449},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"990-1220"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Freshman","body":"I am currently a freshman at Carroll College in Helena, MT.

Upon reading this, you may seem a bit skeptical seeing as how its an \"Assemblies of God\" campus which in your mind is summed up as \"reserved, strict, and overall an anti-'good time' living.\" However, although the University are somewhat strict and frowns upon most cases of going out partying and drinking and has a curfew during the academic year, the atmosphere on each of the halls I wouldn't describe as anything less than family-like.

I am part of a gap year program there called One Life, which I would absolutely recommend to a friend.  It has allowed me to travel to Israel, the Grand Canyon, and countless other places along with living in a community type environment and earning 30 college credits.  As for LBC it self, it is a smaller, Christian school in Lancaster, PA.   LBC is made up of like-minded individuals that are pursuing Christ.  In addition, although this campus is very small (with plenty of room to grow), every part of it is gorgeous.  And with Lancaster city close by, there are countless options to be entertained.  One change I hope LBC will make is to grow their campus.  Although their sports teams perform at a high level for a D3 school, they only have one basketball court that must be shared with other sports teams throughout the week.  They also should have a larger more weight-lifting facility.  Ultimately, I would recommend LBC/One Life to anyone searching for a college.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2018-03-17T15:52:50.231215Z","guid":"267e3e15-6d41-4c7c-9ca4-d3310d39b3ff","rating":4},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":3.33}],"photos":{"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-76.287781,40.074375,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-76.287781,40.074375,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":4.016326530612245,"count":245},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Lancaster, PA"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/lancaster-bible-college/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"bfba009e-0ba4-4107-833e-baed8c564b1d","badge":{"display":"Best Colleges for Business in America","ordinal":439,"total":1020,"vanityURL":"best-colleges-for-business"},"content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":true,"isPremium":false,"name":"Gordon College","type":"College","url":"gordon-college"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.9197},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":29244},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"890-1210"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Junior","body":"It's a great Christian College.

Overall College of Idaho would be a great fit for anyone looking for a small school that offers multiple opportunities for their students.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2018-04-04T21:39:05.32875Z","guid":"549b330e-f960-4427-bc2e-777de418ebfb","rating":4},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":3.33}],"photos":{"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-116.676838,43.652653,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-116.676838,43.652653,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.7350835322195706,"count":419},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Caldwell, ID"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/the-college-of-idaho/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"7b358a5b-c886-44ea-9bb4-e600eb8af12f","badge":{"display":"Best Colleges for Business in America","ordinal":444,"total":1020,"vanityURL":"best-colleges-for-business"},"content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"Andrews University","type":"College","url":"andrews-university"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.4042},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":22012},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"930-1270"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Freshman","body":"I have only been to Andrews for a year so far and I absolutely love it here!

The area is also infested with older, homeless people that can sometimes get awkward, but I've never felt unsafe.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2017-09-30T19:25:10.518202Z","guid":"ae84213a-b185-4958-aa95-645761dab625","rating":4},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":2.66}],"photos":{"default":{"crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/de3476c25d3f81d7e72199c800e9021f425fa28b.jpg","MobileHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/0da435c7a44a06832a8d782b2f3f25e35db145cb.jpg"},"licenseName":"UNLICENSED"},"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-157.866,21.3071,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-157.866,21.3071,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.5645569620253164,"count":790},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Honolulu, HI"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/hawaii-pacific-university/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"2bbaaab0-e6bb-4b98-b5de-a768c4de5af2","badge":{"display":"Best Colleges for Business in America","ordinal":451,"total":1020,"vanityURL":"best-colleges-for-business"},"content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"Brigham Young University - Hawaii","type":"College","url":"brigham-young-university---hawaii"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.2708},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":12319},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"973-1158"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Freshman","body":"Byu Hawaii is a dream come true.\nI love!

But that is what makes Elmhurst the best college to go to! Having a small number of students in your field of program such as Elementary Education is crucial. That means there are not that many graduates from a great college looking for a job in the same area as you. You are able to build a relationship with each of your professors because the class size is about 20 students. Having a real connection with your professor means they get to know you and you get to know them. They will be great references or write great recommendations for whatever you need. In addition to professors, you create long lasting friendships with your peers. Everyone becomes close and you  support each other to get through the semester. I recommend applying to Elmhurst College first.
