It's still small enough to see friends around campus, but big enough to give students the sense of freedom every young adult is looking for when leaving home for the first time. With that, the architecture is beautiful. The hilly streets and tree covered parks add to the breath taking sights as well. It has a great variety of majors, including some of the highest ranked schools in the nation: Kelly, Jacobs, and a few others. Indiana University also includes a number of outstanding graduate programs that have been ranked among the best in the United States. On top of the outstanding scenery and large variety of academics, Indiana University also offers tons of great social groups. This includes a very large Greek life community and practically any club you can think of. Overall, Indiana University will give you a great College Experience!","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2018-03-06T22:10:54.007694Z","guid":"67882c2b-1d0a-4901-b349-6af0c06d2f01","rating":5},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":4}],"photos":{"default":{"crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/384624f1a768b1f1105a87831eb2048f11386291.jpg","MobileHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/4ba85fc5e54092babd4be7cab06641c06ce27a3b.jpg","Thumbnail":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/c349823e87fe38116f01e646076db14a1fa65fea"},"licenseName":"UNLICENSED"},"mapbox_header":{"crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-86.526904,39.166383,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-86.526904,39.166383,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"UNLICENSED"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.744977546679272,"count":4231},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Bloomington, IN"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/indiana-university---bloomington/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"2903a6b2-8158-4848-8d1a-81ebdbba393c","content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"Penn State","type":"College","url":"penn-state"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.564},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":25055},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"1090-1300"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Sophomore","body":"Penn State is an amazing campus with a multitude of career paths to choose from.  There are tons of possibilities that one can get involved in at Penn State through clubs, community involvement, or sports.  As an engineer, I am very glad that I chose this particular school because our engineering department is one of the best in the United States, and the chances of finding a job upon graduation is quite high.  There is one particular thing that I would like to see change in the future at Penn State and that particular change is with academic scholarships for students.  Currently, Penn State only offers athletic scholarships at the main campus, and at branch campuses I was able to find out that they offer academic scholarships.  There are particular scholarships offered through individual colleges at main, but for someone is graduates in the top percentage of their class there should be some sort of scholarship given.

Spring term at Union is still pretty lit though, given that we have ReUnion weekend, Lobster Fest, and Spring Fest.

Extremely strict rules and regulations where violation for missed class or other minor offense may result in 5 hours punishment usually conducted in a physical manner such as marching.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2018-04-30T04:20:17.92536Z","guid":"6f6ba94d-f985-405c-9e2f-8f3764a7ccd3","rating":4},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":4}],"photos":{"default":{"crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/51e986c81df748188b50ed870393ebecffc7cbb6.jpg","MobileHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/3b21d23561fa817efb6037499fa79c553901ddf5.jpg"},"licenseName":"UNLICENSED"},"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-73.956804,41.390882,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-73.956804,41.390882,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.349090909090909,"count":275},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"West Point, NY"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/united-states-military-academy-at-west-point/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"c494ce31-603e-46e3-a477-a03dae81c1be","content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":true,"isPremium":true,"name":"Rutgers University – New Brunswick","type":"College","url":"rutgers-university--new-brunswick"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.5694},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":15614},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"1110-1350"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Senior","body":"Academically, Rutgers is an excellent university. The Philosophy department is one of the best in the country and the German department is fairly small but offers a variety of courses. I was also fortunate enough to study abroad in Germany through Rutgers. There are  scholarship opportunities to offset expenses, and my experience was incredible! The bus system used to transport students from one campus to another is unfortunately sub-par. The drivers take frequent and long breaks, which inconveniences students trying to get to class. A majority of buses themselves don't seem to be well maintained, either, and the bus schedule is unreliable. The quality and variety of the dining hall food is OK, depending on which you go to. There is a lot of cultural and racial diversity on campus, and many different types of course studies, clubs, events, etc. to choose from. Over all, Rutgers is a pretty good school, but one should always be prepared for annoyances.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2018-05-30T18:21:16.015754Z","guid":"01a39b76-f2d9-4942-99de-dbfff1bfa771","rating":4},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":4}],"photos":{"default":{"crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/63edd28c8b5adced9098fd93cc2044f1a1013b1e.jpg","MobileHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/ac486ae5a7a7c83d89cc83347b9440903d55d122.jpg","Thumbnail":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/ab0e0070a7e3c8308c08484d2c5a901dd37b097f"},"licenseName":"UNLICENSED"},"mapbox_header":{"crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-74.45051,40.503796,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-74.45051,40.503796,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"UNLICENSED"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.5708023632551935,"count":5247},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Piscataway, NJ"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/rutgers-university--new-brunswick/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"3cf1630c-6cf0-4189-99aa-10eff7266f78","content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"Stony Brook University, SUNY","type":"College","url":"stony-brook-university-suny"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.4067},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":13615},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"1150-1370"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Freshman","body":"Stony Brook does a fantastic job at getting the students involved in campus life, with multiple activities and events every week.

Mountainview dorms were awfull, invisible RA, no community events, unfriendly people etc. Now I live in Newing and I love it and it’s so much better! Many Long Island students, intentational students (mostly from Asia) and Jewish students. You have to find your people at this school but once you do your experience can be great. Also, we don’t have certain majors like education (also communications, and others people complain about) which really sucks but they try to sell you on their grad program. The food is hit or miss, definitely go to the Kosher station since they have the best food.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2018-05-23T01:30:53.174035Z","guid":"98f168b2-72e9-48d0-bb5e-1cc0fdef30f8","rating":4},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":3.66}],"photos":{"default":{"crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/843cc93be5f59a4bf97adb882d92fccaf932660b.jpg","MobileHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/e1bba7684cb59ca91b80ae5381f80c29566dec0c.jpg"},"licenseName":"UNLICENSED"},"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-75.971143,42.088049,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-75.971143,42.088049,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.5464154411764706,"count":2176},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Vestal, NY"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/binghamton-university-suny/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"8cd719a3-9f66-4a61-a1eb-f2a312b02acc","content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"University of Missouri","type":"College","url":"university-of-missouri"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.747},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":16317},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"1020-1290"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Senior","body":"University of Missouri- Columbia is a school that allows such a variety of studies that almost anyone can find a major they will enjoy pursuing.

I feel extremely fortunate to have spent the past two years at Lewis & Clark.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2018-01-15T04:26:02.009834Z","guid":"3dd9b326-9f82-4bcf-b2fc-82ded7dfaaaf","rating":5},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":3.66}],"photos":{"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-122.672478,45.450547,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-122.672478,45.450547,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.548632218844985,"count":658},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Portland, OR"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/lewis--and--clark-college/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"02b90d8e-3ae7-4e90-8010-bccedd518371","content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"University of California - Santa Cruz","type":"College","url":"university-of-california---santa-cruz"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.5785},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":16261},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"1060-1290"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Sophomore","body":"I love UCSC! I decided to come to this school because of it's beautiful campus and because it is a good school in a prime location for my major (marine biology).  The campus is unlike any I've seen before; you practically forget that you're walking around a college campus because you get so immersed in the beautiful scenic redwood forest around you.  UCSC is also very close to the ocean, making it a great location for those who love to frequent the beach.  Aside from location, I have had great experiences academically with this school.  All of my professors have been extremely kind and genuinely interested in the wellbeing and learning process of their students.  Finally, UCSC is a school that is extremely accepting of people from all different backgrounds, sexual orientations, and cultures and strives to make all students feel welcome.  Has always been my dream school, and still is.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2018-01-24T04:50:19.279179Z","guid":"3213f64d-899a-4ac3-b857-5e9b91f466ef","rating":5},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":3.66}],"photos":{"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-122.067993,36.997258,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-122.067993,36.997258,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.484216459977452,"count":3548},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Santa Cruz, CA"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/university-of-california---santa-cruz/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"7d19ae37-bb2c-4ad8-989f-5fd1cd0c45ce","content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"Washington State University","type":"College","url":"washington-state-university"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.7204},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":17815},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"930-1165"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Sophomore","body":"I've never seen a school so filled with pride! It's incredible to be a part of a family that is nationwide. I've been on vacation, states away, and have heard the familiar greeting of \"Go Cougs!\" from passing strangers. One of the most significant things I like to boast about is how safe and clean the campus is; schools in big cities just can't compete with those aspects of WSU. And, as a young woman living across the state in a new and unfamiliar environment, I can't appreciate enough how hospitable Pullman and the WSU campus is. I'll always recommend WSU to those looking to attend college, it's truly an amazing place to pursue postsecondary education.
