The educational benefits of YSU are amazing for a same state university. \nAlthough, there are somethings I would like to see change. There are not a lot of students that live on campus, there are only three dorm buildings in total. It almost feels like a commuter school in the sense that there are a lot of students that just go to class and then drive home. Weekends are very quiet and there aren't a lot of parties going on mostly because of the lack of students on campus. But, there is some change happening! YSU is building new apartment building the students can stay in.

After changing to a different degree plan that contained classes that were more relevant to my career goal, the department of Kinesiology guided me the entire way! They were very encouraging and willing to help their students to the best of their abilities.

It is a wonderful school with a beautiful camps and great professors. The class sizes are the perfect size, your professor actually get to know your name and they really care about your education. The student life at CMU is great there's never not an activity going on, and if you don't want to stay on campus there many activities just minutes away from the CMU. Weather you like hiking, mountain biking, skiing, paddle boarding you name it then CMU is the right choice for you. And even if you've never done any of those thing CMU has a wonderful Outdoors program that will take you on trips and teach you the basics. Outdoors activites not for you that's okay we have a great rec gym with racquetball courts, basketball courts, rock climbing wall and even a Olympic size swimming pool. So come check out CMU we'd love to have you join our Mavley.

Plus, it's right in downtown! I am part of a honor society for STEM majors and they provided the opportunity for me to do scientific research, and I am in my freshmen year! (also getting a stipend for it).  The university is also down the block from the world's largest medical center (hint hint pre-med and pre-nursing students)!  As for the social life, one can say that students do somewhat lack  is school spirit because it is a commute school so once students are done with classes, they leave. However, it is easier to get involved because of the small environment! I work as a personal trainer at the campus recreation center and I am also part of the orientation team. So I would say that I have been very blessed here at UHD!

I am needing a scholarship because I am in need of a car for transportation. The car I did have just died on me. It was my dad's car. My father always buys used products and cars and think that it is always the safe thing to do. He gave me the car at 300K miles (with a new motor).","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2018-03-19T02:05:06.214576Z","guid":"7fb4e85a-2bf1-4ea7-b69a-5c801bb35a73","rating":5},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":2.66}],"photos":{"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-78.898602,35.974237,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-78.898602,35.974237,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.525852585258526,"count":909},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Durham, NC"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/north-carolina-central-university/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"b87464a3-142a-427b-9586-fc46b7c58986","content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"Northwestern State University of Louisiana","type":"College","url":"northwestern-state-university-of-louisiana"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.618},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":11567},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"880-1100"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Junior","body":"Northwestern State has a wonder variety of activities to keep you interested in school. It’s hard to maintain interest in school year after year without the added benefits of the college. There is clubs, sports, groups, and whole student body that’s main focus is activities for student to enjoy. Northwestern State is a very student oriented campus. There is always something going on to meet new people, to play games, to get out of your comfort zone and explore new things. \n  The only thing I think I would like to see improve is the maps of the campus, there’s so many buildings and so many places to go it’s easy to get lost! Once you learn your way around though, being on campus is so much fun!","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2018-01-29T21:34:02.479542Z","guid":"fcd807f7-a79a-4f5a-a733-6b8dcc3dc486","rating":5},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":2.66}],"photos":{"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-93.097715,31.750675,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-93.097715,31.750675,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.690826727066818,"count":883},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Natchitoches, LA"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/northwestern-state-university-of-louisiana/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"cd7b7a4f-46cf-4237-aba7-e5afa99d9283","content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"Angelo State University","type":"College","url":"angelo-state-university"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.7437},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":10943},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"870-1060"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Freshman","body":"Everyone is super friendly & the classes are a decent size!
