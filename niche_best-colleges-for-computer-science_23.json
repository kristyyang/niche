It's location is ideal, only a quick trip into Philadelphia, but offers a large, green campus to make you feel at home. There are many near by towns that offer fun things to do, but the campus life is HUGE. There are so many ways to get involved! The academics are fair. You truly get a liberal arts experience, taking courses in all different areas of studies. The business school is career driven which is a huge positive, having a focus on getting a job in the future. SJU is a perfect size to make you feel welcome and help you step out of your comfort zone. It has about 5,000 undergraduate students allowing it to feel big and small all at the same time. Additionally, there is a large focus on service and the Jesuit ideals,  allowing students to be immersed in it, but also allowing them to decipher if they want to be involved in that aspect.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2018-05-23T18:46:04.163758Z","guid":"512f4a49-cbdb-4eff-8040-0ff92f07e091","rating":4},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":3.33}],"photos":{"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-75.238343,39.994442,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-75.238343,39.994442,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.527461139896373,"count":965},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Philadelphia, PA"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/saint-josephs-university/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"8f34fbf8-4b19-48f7-afa8-2ce42d051179","content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"University of New Haven","type":"College","url":"university-of-new-haven"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.8053},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":31263},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"930-1140"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Alum","body":"Ujjwal Pruthi\n1.

I refused to research the school because I did not believe Winthrop was the place for me; however,  I toured the campus about three years later.  One reason why is because of the campus's size. In my opinion, Winthrop is a smaller Clemson. Furthermore, the student ratio is 15:1. Another reason is the convivial atmosphere. Winthrop's faculties are organized, easy to find, and productive. For example, the student center has over four different restaurants and the workers are nice. The staff occupying these places such as the recreation center, bookstore, and admissions office are welcoming, helpful, and friendly. Last but not least, Winthrop has the graphic design program which is my intended major. Thus, I have been accepted into Winthrop University and I am looking forward to finish in two years.

They have not only helped me become successful, but many other students their service. The classrooms are up to date and the campuses are very clean for the most part. I felt safe being on the main campus because of the amount of security on campus.

The campus is a very inviting environment; there are always events going on whether it is sports, diversity, or arts. The professors give off a warm, caring  aroma. No student should be afraid to ask for help from their professor; they are always willing whether it is through office hours or email. MSUM offers many ways to help students succeed; from tutoring to the Wellness Center for physical health. The campus is just the right size, not too small yet not overwhelming as well. As soon as I visited MSUM my senior year of high school, I knew it was home. Though, what I would like to see change is the exclusion from some activities held on campus. For example, they have activities that exclude some students from clubs or learning communities. I wish for more equality in allowing all students to be involved. Otherwise, I believe MSUM is a great place full of opportunities for students to further their education.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2017-11-26T05:07:52.397844Z","guid":"0ece1c33-a37d-4bed-abe0-cadcfc074cbc","rating":4},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":3}],"photos":{"default":{"crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/db9b3a0ff27f272424f505083bf388c9377f84cd.jpg","MobileHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/9579f183666104e0e7185a4591a4b5f6878c5147.jpg"},"licenseName":"UNLICENSED"},"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-96.763376,46.866482,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-96.763376,46.866482,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.4360795454545454,"count":704},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Moorhead, MN"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/minnesota-state-university-moorhead/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"96157503-b967-490a-ad5e-c0d0d18b2dc1","content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":true,"isPremium":false,"name":"University of Nebraska at Kearney","type":"College","url":"university-of-nebraska-at-kearney"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.8508},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":15520},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"830-1020"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Freshman","body":"My experience at the University of Nebraska at Kearney has been very good.

Also, it is great to be so close to Broad Ripple and Downtown as this is obviously a big advantage both professionally and socially.

Academically, Midwestern State is excellent and its different departments offer different opportunities for its students to get scholarships as they are posted in each department. Midwestern State also encourages the all rounded education of its students as it requires each student to take classes outside of their major. The institution is also home to a variety of students from all over the world; it boasts students from the Caribbean, Africa, as well as Asia.
