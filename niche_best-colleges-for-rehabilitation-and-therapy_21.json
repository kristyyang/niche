There are always opportunities to get involved and get active on campus. If you show effort, the teachers will meet you half way. They are very willing and open to assistance. My academic adviser is the absolute best. I am comfortable going to see her about anything whether it is school related or not. I was proactive about scheduling so for me, it was easy to get the classes I wanted at the times I wanted. However, they have yet to begin online registration methods but word around is that we should have it for next fall. One set back is that the business office and financial aid offices are not very efficient and are not always on the same page. I had to keep going back and talking with both of them to get one simple thing done that turned out to be a slack on their part. Also, there seems to be some unnecessary general education classes, but that is expected being though that this is a Christian, private school. Other than that I have had a fine time here. I like the small campus and class setting, so this was a good pick for me.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2016-02-09T01:02:59Z","guid":"c5013cc6-c0dd-458c-9831-6d438a8e25a3","rating":4},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":2}],"photos":{"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-77.774231,36.017443,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-77.774231,36.017443,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.450980392156863,"count":204},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Rocky Mount, NC"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/north-carolina-wesleyan-college/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"f28d5c66-21a8-4b37-9ba2-c529e43df2d1","content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":true,"isPremium":true,"name":"Concordia University Irvine","type":"College","url":"concordia-university-irvine"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.6504},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":26180},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"907-1160"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Junior","body":"The professors, classes, and student activities are amazing! Professors are very available to talk to and most genuinely care about how you are doing and are willing to help you outside of class, even with projects unrelated to their specific class in some cases.The material is engaging and forces you to think in new ways and see how the different academic disciplines can connect together. However, the administrative side of Concordia (academic advising, financial aid...) is not very well organized and could use some improvement. Great education department and many study abroad options, with opportunities to meet students from all across the world. Students are very friendly and there is always an interesting event going on somewhere on campus.

We had a great season which featured playoff appearances as a team, and individually, I started every game and scored two game winning goals as a freshman. My coach put lots of faith in me. In the classroom, professors were very involved and seemed to care a lot more than typical college professors. I finished with a 3.6 GPA. The campus is beautiful and small.

The people that inhabit Adams are very warm beings and the professors are truly helpful and compassionate. As an athlete, the school does a good job of taking good care of us but not placing us above the other students. Though based in a small town, Adams is a great institution for any student looking to further the progression of their dreams and goals for numerous reasons!","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2017-09-21T19:57:53.12024Z","guid":"d41cacb3-a5b1-4caa-982c-89c5febbc41b","rating":4},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":2.33}],"photos":{"default":{"crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/43fc4622f3eab1d8008f08521bb555afb5176224.jpg","MobileHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/4dd7bbe6fd6eb11ccd57c185e5ea325329a52076.jpg"},"licenseName":"UNLICENSED"},"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-105.880943,37.477238,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-105.880943,37.477238,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.3946360153256707,"count":522},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Alamosa, CO"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/adams-state-university/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"b0bed62f-b0d1-411a-ba4f-2389721e2196","content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"Oklahoma City University","type":"College","url":"oklahoma-city-university"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.7215},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":26002},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"990-1228"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Sophomore","body":"As a student athlete and musician at Oklahoma City University, I experience a wide variety of things.

They have a variety of clubs and organizations that help and assist students involve themselves in activities and internships!  Our staff members involve themselves as much as possible in order for students to find their right major. We are a big family , regardless of how small we are. Also, I will never get tired of saying this... Everyone is nice. Texas Wesleyan is a diverse, fun and successful University. We have late night activities, for example, bonfires, cookouts, \"Naked but Real\", (students come out to share there art pieces including poems, songs etc.) sand volleyball, free shirts, free meals on occasions and tea!
