Coming from two states over, this is the perfect place to learn to start living on your own, as the campus is easy to navigate, safe, and diverse. While I have heard there are some less than perfect profs on campus, mine have been nothing but kind and extremely intelligent. I am a part of TUs choirs, and my experience there has also been positive, however on the athletics front, although I do not care for sports, I have heard from friends who are involved that they're not the best, namely the Equestrian Team. The food also gets tiring and disappointing, but they have their days, i.e. Taco Tueaday. Overall, my first year on campus has been successful, and I would recommend this uni to my friends.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2018-04-25T06:58:44.975914Z","guid":"37ffa23b-b23e-424b-a05f-2a6f48b32e98","rating":4},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":2.33}],"photos":{"default":{"crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/530d5360f0bd422fda50f8e405df4ed7548ea99a.jpg","MobileHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/ce71674f2e3278ccffcd89792f967c9bbe9617f2.jpg"},"licenseName":"UNLICENSED"},"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-83.18355,41.119193,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-83.18355,41.119193,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.557404326123128,"count":601},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Tiffin, OH"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/tiffin-university/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"86927070-080d-490e-b03e-74cf375edf6a","content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"Lasell College","type":"College","url":"lasell-college"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.7606},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":25893},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"870-1060"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Alum","body":"My experience at Lasell College was overall a great experience. The campus is small and everything is easily accessible, no running across massive campus to get from class to class. The class sizes were small so it allowed for Professors to teach on a more personal basis. The professors were almost all  fair and excellent as well, there was only one I would complain about but is no longer employed. The people are friendly, however the population did not seem very diverse. There were plenty of places to relax or study as a commuting student, and parking spaces were not too bad to locate for the most part. Classes were challenging but practical and allowed for great preparation. I graduated with my Bachelor of Science from Lasell with great satisfaction, and I am even planning to return to Lasell for my graduate degree this coming fall.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2018-02-26T22:09:26.153315Z","guid":"e3b4a2f0-8ffd-48ea-92bb-866a5db0f0b5","rating":4},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":2.33}],"photos":{"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-71.243738,42.342712,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-71.243738,42.342712,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.413870246085011,"count":447},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Newton, MA"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/lasell-college/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"e08e643d-b10a-4d71-9ec6-666077482edb","badge":{"display":"Best Colleges in America","ordinal":351,"total":1644,"vanityURL":"best-colleges"},"content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":true,"isPremium":true,"name":"Ohio Wesleyan University","type":"College","url":"ohio-wesleyan-university"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.7155},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":27967},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"990-1250"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Freshman","body":"Small town atmosphere, safe, plenty to do, liberal arts, fun fun fun!

Sure, it does not have the big school sports scene but the college was top ranked in division two in severals sports. Security seems tight so far and there's a real emphasis on community service. If you want a school where the student will not get lost in a crowd and will get a very good foundation, Rockhurst is an under the radar gem with well respected academics as with most Jesuit colleges. Its not a commuter school even though its in an urban area.

Security is always around, & they are really nice!","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2017-06-28T22:23:57.183887Z","guid":"fc90f879-5ae8-4cb6-a0d9-826b3441c57a","rating":4},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":2}],"photos":{"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-75.527377,39.16325,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-75.527377,39.16325,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.2875,"count":480},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Dover, DE"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/wesley-college/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"f3ea2c4a-0473-4aa3-a99b-17b356c48847","badge":{"display":"Best Colleges in America","ordinal":526,"total":1644,"vanityURL":"best-colleges"},"content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":true,"isPremium":false,"name":"Fontbonne University","type":"College","url":"fontbonne-university"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.97},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":18514},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"1001-1190"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Junior","body":"I love Fontbonne University! It's a small campus which makes getting around to classes super easy. It also means that everyone knows everyone else, and everyone on campus, staff, faculty, and students are friendly! The buildings are nice and classrooms are comfortable. Fontbonne recently added a new parking lot which helped a lot. Fontbonne also offers a lot of activities and fun events. The only thing I would change is the cost of parking passes. FBU is a private University so tuition is crazy expensive and so are parking passes. I feel like since we already pay a ton in tuition, parking passes should be cheaper, if not free!

So far in my education, it has been nothing but great. The professors truly care about students' education; they hold review sessions before test and put in a lot of extra hours outside of class. Newman has a very strong science program, so if you're looking at going to graduate school to become a physician, dentist, physical therapist, etc. I would strongly recommend Newman. In addition to its science program, Newman also has a very strong Nursing program, school of education, and Criminal Justice program. If you're looking for a big college environment Newman probably isn't the school for you; it's pretty small.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2018-05-14T18:47:38.584346Z","guid":"b3e27ad3-0ea8-48f5-9474-21836f6c0e15","rating":5},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":2.66}],"photos":{"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-97.378803,37.672306,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-97.378803,37.672306,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.6458333333333335,"count":192},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Wichita, KS"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/newman-university/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"b0d6a27f-d5ef-47fa-a0f4-591a484409f3","badge":{"display":"Best Colleges in America","ordinal":680,"total":1644,"vanityURL":"best-colleges"},"content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"Mount St. Joseph University","type":"College","url":"mount-st-joseph-university"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.8805},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":17728},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"890-1140"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Sophomore","body":"Mount St Joseph University is an exceptional institution overall and is worthy of praise in many regards. First and foremost the university prides itself on the achievement of academic excellence for its entire student body. The curriculum is varied, interesting and is engineered to maximize the character and well roundedness of its students. This quality of academic achievement is made possible only by an attentive and caring faculty of professors, many of which are expert in their respective fields. Student life at the university is also exceptional. All incoming students are welcomed warmly. The helpfulness of the staff is remarkable considering the fact that each professor is ready and willing to sit one on one with students for discussion. One shortcoming of the university, however, is that, even with its veritable course selection, it offers but one foreign language, that being Spanish. Personally I would have enjoyed a more wide ranging selection of languages.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2017-06-05T19:42:51.155873Z","guid":"52fe6210-a473-4984-9805-bb0f61271409","rating":4},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":3}],"photos":{"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-84.640143,39.094519,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-84.640143,39.094519,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.464968152866242,"count":314},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Cincinnati, OH"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/mount-st-joseph-university/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"870e0b83-934b-4015-b556-9c3cb4fad3b9","content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"College of Our Lady of the Elms","type":"College","url":"college-of-our-lady-of-the-elms"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.7646},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":23846},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"840-1055"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Alum","body":"Great school, small and friendly community, exceptional faculty.
