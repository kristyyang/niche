The professors sincerely care about the students' education and are always there for them. Since it is a small college, the community is tightly-knit; students can hardly walk across campus without saying hello to at least one person, students have movie nights and mixers together, and sometimes will even be invited to dine at professors' houses. Hillsdale is academically challenging, which creates an excellence that allows students to self-govern, and discover how to think.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2017-04-26T21:22:41.395562Z","guid":"4413aa3a-4f1a-43e4-8004-fdb285a665cd","rating":4},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":3.33}],"photos":{"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-84.62,41.89,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-84.62,41.89,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.679640718562874,"count":334},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Hillsdale, MI"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/hillsdale-college/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"512cda37-4f86-4dca-be88-1ba7b7f6b439","content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"Rockhurst University","type":"College","url":"rockhurst-university"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.7406},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":23753},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"986-1166"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Niche User","body":"I'm the parent of a Rockhurst sophomore and feel like the university has been an excellent choice for my daughter, and she agrees. Its a close knit school and very friendly csmpus. Academics are very good with small class sizes.  My daughter, who is African American, has made friends of all sorts and is involved in a lot. Sure, it does not have the big school sports scene but the college was top ranked in division two in severals sports. Security seems tight so far and there's a real emphasis on community service. If you want a school where the student will not get lost in a crowd and will get a very good foundation, Rockhurst is an under the radar gem with well respected academics as with most Jesuit colleges. Its not a commuter school even though its in an urban area. Campus is beautiful and not urban looking at all.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2017-08-26T05:03:14.500932Z","guid":"d2dcfbca-2735-4506-a1cb-af03240d0215","rating":5},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":3.66}],"photos":{"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-94.571249,39.030843,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-94.571249,39.030843,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.589080459770115,"count":348},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Kansas City, MO"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/rockhurst-university/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"1c9182d2-2d4a-4181-8e42-19f15cb46ea3","content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"University of St. Thomas - Texas","type":"College","url":"university-of-st-thomas---texas"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.7739},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":21517},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"990-1175"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Freshman","body":"This university is actually pretty awesome. Despite the not-so-great food selection, everything else is great! The moment you step on campus, everyone is super nice and welcoming. The fact that it's a small school (which means small class sizes) makes it very easy to develop a close relationship with your professors! The classes are all academically demanding, so as long as you try and do your work, you should be fine! Student life is pretty good as the RA's and CA's, as well as the clubs and organizations around school, come up with some fun events and activities that everyone can enjoy! It honestly is very easy to make friends, especially if you live in the dorms. UST offers some great academic programs and they are very generous when awarding scholarships. Overall, the University of St. Thomas is a great school.

The students can get a little rattled when it comes to politics and it's really liberal, some people like that others don't, just depends on who you talk to. The campus is sooo beautiful all throughout the year! And housing is one the best parts because most of the rooms are really big and you can get a single your sophomore year.

I have no complaints about this school at all!","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2017-07-18T11:23:05.66849Z","guid":"7e1f2c4a-eced-4a86-bbdb-6b2724b4959c","rating":5},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":2.33}],"photos":{"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-73.1035,42.692427,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-73.1035,42.692427,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.076586433260394,"count":457},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"North Adams, MA"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/massachusetts-college-of-liberal-arts/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"84d212db-1ef1-4f97-8b18-4d5f1f8525f4","content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"Texas Lutheran University","type":"College","url":"texas-lutheran-university"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.4261},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":20694},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"880-1070"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Freshman","body":"TLU have been a blast, I have very good professors who explain things I may have a problem understanding on. I have a great schedule that fits how I work. I've got the chance to become friends with a whole lot of people I would not have met usually. Lots of them comes from places miles away which boggles my mind! I have found my classes very interesting and not too difficult, Just gotta keep up on whats going on! The only major problem I have is the mytlu website we use to access lots of things is a little difficult to navigate through when it comes to finding things such as student employment and some things aren't able to be found online such as some events. Other than That I really am enjoying TLU and blessed I even get the chance to attend this amazing university.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2018-01-31T05:32:35.153213Z","guid":"3e285b69-5a49-4321-bf3f-5fa6ab099c5c","rating":4},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":3}],"photos":{"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-97.984601,29.573274,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-97.984601,29.573274,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.603938730853392,"count":457},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Seguin, TX"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/texas-lutheran-university/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"12311f54-37d0-4716-ba9e-683f7efae651","content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":true,"isPremium":false,"name":"Roberts Wesleyan College","type":"College","url":"roberts-wesleyan-college"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.9},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":22681},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"970-1160"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Senior","body":"The higher education experience I received at Roberts was excellent.
