It is definitely a very liberal campus so may be difficult for conservative students but this climate definitely challenges conservative students to clearly think through their opinions and convictions, ultimately molding everyone to be a more careful thinker, more articulate speaker and writer, and better global citizen.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2018-02-23T13:41:41.112665Z","guid":"887a2db1-f1aa-4ddd-b666-7a87fd8bcae3","rating":5},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":4}],"photos":{"default":{"crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/23de020ed1f1e711fce623b93d51658fd31845ef.jpg","MobileHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/ae7e258edc46e9db455df5d463c1be2ae7c17d43.jpg","Thumbnail":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/be9a22e0a8a992cf1aec55766e9178fe18c527dc"},"licenseName":"UNLICENSED"},"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-118.210783,34.126224,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-118.210783,34.126224,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.6056338028169015,"count":426},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Los Angeles, CA"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/occidental-college/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"f56abd54-4c72-4706-aa60-b7b2db1435b1","badge":{"display":"Best Colleges for Political Science in America","ordinal":82,"total":520,"vanityURL":"best-colleges-for-political-science"},"content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"University of California - Santa Barbara","type":"College","url":"university-of-california---santa-barbara"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.3577},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":15149},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"1120-1390"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Alum","body":"I had a great experience attending UCSB!

Whether it's research or internships or pursuits fo further education, proactive St. Olaf students have many resources they can take advantage of. The curriculum is tough no matter what department you take courses in. Professors have extremely high expectations for their students, however they do everything in their power to build your way to those high expectations. It can be difficult to find a study/social life balance. If you cannot develop strong study habits, classes will be a struggle. There are a ton of resources available to students who haven't established study habits and professors are happy to work with students. The open-door policy is an awesome thing to take advantage of. There can be a sense of a competitive atmosphere, but usually there is a stronger sense of community and camaraderie between students because everyone is facing many of the same challenges in an academic sense.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2017-12-29T06:15:09.010955Z","guid":"0327f163-663c-474f-aa4e-9a560bc27a1d","rating":4},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":4}],"photos":{"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-93.183633,44.462884,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-93.183633,44.462884,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.617862371888726,"count":683},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Northfield, MN"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/st-olaf-college/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"4a4fe604-d453-446d-986a-c1de1ee249c4","badge":{"display":"Best Colleges for Political Science in America","ordinal":89,"total":520,"vanityURL":"best-colleges-for-political-science"},"content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":true,"isPremium":false,"name":"University of Minnesota - Twin Cities","type":"College","url":"university-of-minnesota---twin-cities"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.4441},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":16242},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"1180-1450"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Niche User","body":"The University of Minnesota is a welcoming, lively, and beautiful university.

The people here at UCSD are unlike any people I have met, they are social in their own way (its a very admirable and fascinating trait). Just because UCSD holds the reputation of no parties does not make the school socially dead, there are other ways people can socialize! There are campus events for everyone in any college and there are events that are specific to each individual college. \nThe people here each have amazing distinct personalities in which anyone can find who they vibe with easily.

The physics department is particularly impressive, except for its distinct lack of coffee (it's time: get a cafe in/near Loomis already).","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2018-04-29T05:27:03.992779Z","guid":"3d055a45-3d23-42f6-a4eb-65bda8f2a411","rating":4},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":4.33}],"photos":{"default":{"author":"vsmithuk","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/3bd07b7ad6f7539602b686c397574b5df9aedcbd.jpg","MobileHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/a3ceb931e74031ade74565eea2d1d30c9ee4e770.jpg","Thumbnail":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/0ec9783e6ecefa67c0081d4d083fbd2ec39cb2d8"},"licenseName":"CC BY ","licenseUrl":"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/2.0/","sourceUrl":"https://www.flickr.com/photos/vsmithuk/370812598/"},"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-88.230309,40.108864,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-88.230309,40.108864,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.68393536121673,"count":4208},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Champaign, IL"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/university-of-illinois-at-urbana-champaign/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"319b5387-5c04-4800-8c43-235676099e04","badge":{"display":"Best Colleges for Political Science in America","ordinal":96,"total":520,"vanityURL":"best-colleges-for-political-science"},"content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"College of Wooster","type":"College","url":"college-of-wooster"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.5816},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":29813},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"1070-1350"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Junior","body":"I absolutely love the College of Wooster! When I visited for the first time, I fell in love with the atmosphere of the College. I felt welcomed right away and never lost this feeling. Additionally, I loved that the students seemed to really care about their campus and that most students are extremely involved on campus. This was all clear to me during my tour and then when I sat in on a class, I was sold. The professor I had was engaging and made the rather large classroom (by Wooster's standards) seem much more intimate. I remember hearing students talking about the class and other classes before and after the lecture, which made me realize how engaged in academics students here are. Fast forward four years and here I am typing this review as a junior at the College. I am so happy that I chose the College of Wooster and that every good thought I had about the College has been proven right ten-fold since coming here.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2017-09-28T19:14:11.732478Z","guid":"7151ada7-491c-482a-be1f-89289234009d","rating":5},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":4}],"photos":{"default":{"author":"cogdog","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/c7b22f39c24ab144a0e0d2445bc21b28e7c67cf2.jpg","MobileHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/fecf2c4978a9be0483d19ec59e55c5e28fd10796.jpg","Thumbnail":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/e06a3442f84bca7de61c7a2e58f95766e6633c97"},"licenseName":"CC BY ","licenseUrl":"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/2.0/","sourceUrl":"https://www.flickr.com/photos/cogdog/8763606508/"},"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-81.934674,40.81046,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-81.934674,40.81046,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.536326530612245,"count":1225},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Wooster, OH"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/college-of-wooster/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"5c9ab696-de0e-4271-8bf4-163137359704","badge":{"display":"Best Colleges for Political Science in America","ordinal":97,"total":520,"vanityURL":"best-colleges-for-political-science"},"content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":true,"isPremium":false,"name":"Willamette University","type":"College","url":"willamette-university"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.7806},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":32628},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"1100-1330"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Freshman","body":"The university is an accepting community to all of whom it welcomes. While it has a very rigorous academic program, the school also provides a range of resource to choose from if a student is ever in need of help, both academically and otherwise. Despite being an open campus, as a cis-female individual I still feel reasonably safe. The campus is small and beautiful, with the state capital building just across the street. The student body shares a close-knit bond that is perhaps even more so than larger schools, due to the smaller undergrad population. Professors and staff are generally very open, accepting, and easy to approach without fear of judgement. It is a very expensive education, but the majority of students receive some sort of financial aid or scholarship. I'm so glad to be fortunate enough to be able to attend this school.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2018-05-18T20:39:06.20624Z","guid":"0f4d17a5-cf3c-4882-af66-e03a836d4ad0","rating":4},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":3.66}],"photos":{"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-123.030727,44.935743,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-123.030727,44.935743,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.601108033240997,"count":722},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Salem, OR"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/willamette-university/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"f5464544-1058-40ec-a8be-41422b38bd6c","badge":{"display":"Best Colleges for Political Science in America","ordinal":98,"total":520,"vanityURL":"best-colleges-for-political-science"},"content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"University of Washington","type":"College","url":"university-of-washington"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.4535},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":10068},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"1120-1370"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Senior","body":"The life is great and overall one of the best schools in Washington state.

With a campus in the \"capital of the world\", the location provides opportunities unrivaled by others.  By planning ahead, you can schedule classes with some top-notch professors who actively help students succeed and provide an unforgettable learning experience.  Though Core requirements are extensive, even excessive to some, they make way for an education that explores all fields.  The Jesuit presence is in no way overbearing and the community is open to a diversity of thought (Professors are almost always unrelated to the Church; even theology classes teach a variety of religions).  The Rose Hill campus is quite beautiful, boasting sports teams, a large library, and a variety of eateries.  Both campuses are very safe and any incidents are vigilantly pursued by campus safety and the NYPD. Fordham can be a very good experience, if deemed worth the price point (note they do award aid) and if one is willing to take advantage of their time there.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2018-06-05T17:39:23.039915Z","guid":"c7e106e7-e1c4-45d2-8987-d3382185aaa0","rating":4},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":3.66}],"photos":{"default":{"crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/58a16aa62394c04c88abf70482b6dfc699f8d219.jpg","MobileHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/2a5478c448466060f510b754b7a99112cf2dbc0c.jpg"},"licenseName":"UNLICENSED"},"mapbox_header":{"crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-73.889578,40.861183,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-73.889578,40.861183,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"UNLICENSED"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.4920049200492005,"count":1626},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Bronx, NY"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/fordham-university/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"af7eab45-d4b3-47ec-bd76-17bed4baf006","badge":{"display":"Best Colleges for Political Science in America","ordinal":100,"total":520,"vanityURL":"best-colleges-for-political-science"},"content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":true,"isPremium":true,"name":"Skidmore College","type":"College","url":"skidmore-college"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.2908},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":23941},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"1120-1330"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Junior","body":"A beautiful school with truly a place for everyone.

There are also so many extracurricular activities to participate in, and if something you want is not there, it is very easy to start your own club!  The campus dining services are incredible.  Dhall is life and I would be so lost without Spa and Burgess.  Dorms and on-campus apartments are spacious and have everything you could possibly need!
