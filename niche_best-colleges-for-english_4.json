It's not just about the grades at this university, it truly is about learning information and expanding your knowledge. The location is great as well. A safe small town that still is full of fun activities to keep students occupied on the weekends. Another great part of Bucknell is that it is a liberal science university.

However, I still think SCU was the right choice for me.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2017-12-31T03:17:32.766825Z","guid":"9c8b406f-6fb6-4bf9-a2cc-690eb7af0549","rating":5},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":4}],"photos":{"default":{"crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/37ce712dc9ae0942fba9ffed0bf0ca51daa1c6b0.jpg","MobileHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/098e75a6ab19572012ff48bf561b654185b3108f.jpg","Thumbnail":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/f614b2d92bded94a44be367c452c16c3b7c56f82"},"licenseName":"UNLICENSED"},"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-121.938189,37.352706,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-121.938189,37.352706,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.6813611755607116,"count":1293},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Santa Clara, CA"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/santa-clara-university/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"3fd5adb3-1879-47c5-a7c7-995fc22225d1","badge":{"display":"Best Colleges for English in America","ordinal":85,"total":647,"vanityURL":"best-colleges-for-english"},"content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"Wheaton College - Illinois","type":"College","url":"wheaton-college---illinois"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.7865},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":27840},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"1170-1400"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Alum","body":"The academic rigor and Christian atmosphere that draw most people there drew me as well.

Despite all of its flaws and imperfections, it is a safe space where I can explore and learn. The campus itself is a small city with features that make it feel more cozy than full-out sophisticated. From our beautiful Cathedral of Learning (we lovingly call her Cathy) to the spacious Schenley Park, there are tons of secret nooks that are perfect for studying. The professors, while teaching multiple classes, still make themselves available for questions outside the classroom. They are never too busy to stop and chat if you see them around campus; they really care about your education and that you have a passion for what you are studying. Overall, Pitt is an amazing college to attend. The community surrounding the campus challenge you and support you all at once. I’m extremely happy I made the decision to attend the University of Pittsburgh.

It's also easy to get involved on campus: there are RSOs for just about any interest, so it's easy to find people with common interests.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2017-04-09T17:50:18.991942Z","guid":"32998311-aa84-4435-ac00-c52986c1d140","rating":5},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":4}],"photos":{"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-88.990622,40.491522,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-88.990622,40.491522,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.6274165202108963,"count":569},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Bloomington, IL"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/illinois-wesleyan-university/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"7506bda8-994b-4e7a-a0b8-cbd64bed03bb","badge":{"display":"Best Colleges for English in America","ordinal":100,"total":647,"vanityURL":"best-colleges-for-english"},"content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"Union College - New York","type":"College","url":"union-college---new-york"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.369},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":38621},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"1220-1400"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Senior","body":"Review Continued: The social scene is Greek dominated; the Minerva system is an absolute joke. Parties are moving off campus. The administration is cracking down on Greek life HARD! On campus parties are no longer the same, and are pretty much used as pre games for the off campus parties, Wednesdays nights are practically nonexistent compared to what it was when I was a freshman thanks to the cops and administration (more of a small gathering night for upperclassmen), and Thursday AD dinner parties (which is a frat known for hosting the spot to be on a Thursday night) no longer exist due to the administration. Spring term at Union is still pretty lit though, given that we have ReUnion weekend, Lobster Fest, and Spring Fest. The social scene for the most part, given that Greek life makes up 70% of the student body (Union butchers this statistic as it includes freshman, even though you can't pledge until sophomore year) is getting blackout and going to an off campus party nowadays.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2016-12-22T18:45:44.991174Z","guid":"3f25e605-a90b-4599-8c44-58eda1d27e16","rating":4},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":4}],"photos":{"default":{"author":"jirka_matousek","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/1c50f212b43127310b4796fcdc08c4db170301ea.jpg","MobileHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/a085f7463737d2d7a537e43fac12c8fa2f8c5316.jpg","Thumbnail":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/ff1a2a9f6b4a027509cca9cc5f8c02efce604fcd"},"licenseName":"CC BY ","licenseUrl":"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/2.0/","sourceUrl":"https://www.flickr.com/photos/jirka_matousek/8374084149/"},"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-73.928498,42.817578,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-73.928498,42.817578,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.601923076923077,"count":520},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Schenectady, NY"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/union-college---new-york/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"59885caa-b205-4c07-ab30-607ad21c8e12","badge":{"display":"Best Colleges for English in America","ordinal":101,"total":647,"vanityURL":"best-colleges-for-english"},"content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"Southwestern University","type":"College","url":"southwestern-university"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.4503},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":25622},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"1050-1280"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Sophomore","body":"Although at first glance I was not completely sure SU would be the school for me, after simply days there I knew that I was home.
