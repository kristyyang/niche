Unfortunately, like all colleges, there are issues with the administration, in that they sometimes have a misguided view of what the student body wants or needs.

If you want to start a project, do research, get internships, or help out in the community, you have to have some initiative but it pays off. I got a really cool internship through the career services and completed a fulfilling work-study.\n\nI took classes and electives in several departments outside my major, including education, communication and psychology, and I gained a lot of practical knowledge. Professors are intelligent, funny, and made learning feel less like work. Definitely recommend the senior capstone project required by several majors because it gives you the research and writing skills needed to do a master's thesis project closely supervised by faculty.\n\nStudent body is quiet but has a lot of neat interests and passions. The college could do more to bring that out, but there's a lot of potential.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2017-07-11T18:37:09.679548Z","guid":"476b0a9b-ac4a-420c-b193-a7b5d224093b","rating":5},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":2.66}],"photos":{"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-81.251817,41.717841,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-81.251817,41.717841,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.4285714285714284,"count":175},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Painesville, OH"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/lake-erie-college/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"7ddc5498-856a-4ed9-91ff-8db68d4672cb","content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"West Liberty University","type":"College","url":"west-liberty-university"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.717},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":12285},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"830-990"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Freshman","body":"West Liberty has a great atmosphere, the campus is nice and peaceful.

Campus life and party life are good for me because I am a social person. Food is alright. Spellmann is great with Sushi, Chic-fil-a, Qdoba, etc., but you never know what you're in for at Evans. It's hard to be healthy at this school. The campus is beautiful, and if you make friends easily like me, you don't have a problem with the commuter culture.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2017-07-25T22:21:25.446621Z","guid":"5447a269-12fd-4ec9-96e8-0f593198b4e5","rating":4},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":2.66}],"photos":{"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-90.502825,38.788203,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-90.502825,38.788203,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.5039893617021276,"count":752},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Saint Charles, MO"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/lindenwood-university/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"64d8b1e0-b8cb-4358-8880-643050a09d66","content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"Western Washington University","type":"College","url":"western-washington-university"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.8312},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":16245},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"990-1220"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Freshman","body":"Western Washington University has a great community established in the university as well as surrounding the university.

Cannot beat the small class sizes and professor attention. Coming from Rutgers university i really appreciate that. Not as cutthroat as rutgers or other schools. I also actually like that each professor takes attendance and counts it as ten percent or more, of your grade. This encourages class attendance and pushes their students to do well. It is very possible to get a 4.0 if you show up to class and put in the effort, which for some classes requires less work than others.  I gave 4/5 because of the parking situation although they are trying to improve this situation by adding across the street parking.

This school is also very affordable for both in-state and out-of-state students, thanks to the Bearcat Advantage scholarship which covers the difference of in-state tuition for out-of-state students. Another great thing about this university is that laptops and textbooks are included in tuition. Aside from the academic and campus culture, the community culture is also amazing.

They are definitely lacking in the social aspect and should coordinate more vibrant events.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2018-04-26T17:56:19.949051Z","guid":"98e81e06-7ce2-4632-a8e7-b9e4a199bc1d","rating":4},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":3.66}],"photos":{"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-87.651145,41.872651,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-87.651145,41.872651,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.5712780898876404,"count":2848},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Chicago, IL"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/university-of-illinois-at-chicago/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"a1361929-d873-4799-80ec-6a107d1c0d6c","content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"SUNY Buffalo State College","type":"College","url":"suny-buffalo-state-college"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.6407},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":12046},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"775-980"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Freshman","body":"Wow, I got 3 acceptance letters! One of them was from my dream school, SUNY Buffalo State! I've dreamed about going to this school for about two years, so seeing that acceptance letter really brightened up my life. August 23, 2016, the first day I stepped foot on campus. Boy oh boy was it hard for me to maintain a calm manner. i was really excited to see my dorm. I received my room key and ID that same day. I got to the door and slid the room key in the slot. I couldn't believe how bright the room looked and how roomy it was. From the looks of my room, I believed i would've had the best college experience ever.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2017-03-09T22:06:22.973548Z","guid":"a274f32e-17b9-41f2-a37f-9c1828519a9f","rating":5},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":2.33}],"photos":{"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-78.88067,42.934199,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-78.88067,42.934199,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.412650602409639,"count":1328},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Buffalo, NY"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/suny-buffalo-state-college/#scatterplot"}}]}
