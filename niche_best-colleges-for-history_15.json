I had not dreamed of a learning atmosphere where the student's input and idea's were valued as much as a teachers, of a place that encouraged individuality and self expression to the extent that Mass Art does. I feel myself growing and discovering so much about myself as an artist, because my school allows me to trust my intuition.

The small class sizes, the dedicated teachers, and it's the most affordable waterfront place you can find! The only red flag I see from St. Mary's is the limited majors. Lucky for me, I am studying to be a teacher in the St. Mary's five year teaching program. However, not everyone can be so lucky.

Also, the dorms are clean and feel homey just as if you were at home! This is one of the other reasons I love Portland State.

I lived in Selleck which boasts a varied exchange student population. The dining halls are great and dorms are clean. The campus is right near downtown with plenty of entertainment within walking distance. There is a convenient on-site health clinic, and the athletics program cannot be beat.  I would recommend UNL to any prospective college student.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2018-01-11T20:43:26.480298Z","guid":"ac972c2e-9420-40e7-9ee7-f3e0a11b9263","rating":5},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":4}],"photos":{"default":{"author":"ivyfield","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/dcb2fb513e8b6d533b4a4991f0cef81323fb1bde.jpg","MobileHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/4690d091f954f63a1c9b504057710be089e888d2.jpg","Thumbnail":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/43295d3eedc379e04f35377371efecce49167e67"},"licenseName":"CC BY ","licenseUrl":"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/2.0/","sourceUrl":"https://www.flickr.com/photos/ivyfield/6986330897/in/album-72157603879379896/"},"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-96.702177,40.822272,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-96.702177,40.822272,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.674708818635607,"count":2404},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Lincoln, NE"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/university-of-nebraska---lincoln/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"23dfdc50-c6a3-42a5-b318-71186d894781","content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":true,"isPremium":false,"name":"Taylor University","type":"College","url":"taylor-university"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.7961},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":25429},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"950-1250"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Junior","body":"Taylor is a great Christian school focusing primarily of getting a Christian education in order to build up characteristics of servant leaders. The school is making strides towards improving the positive nature of their diversity, which is encouraging during these times of racial tension. Taylor University has a lot to work on financially. Students are unable to attend the university without experience substantial debt as their financial aid programs are lacking. I'm hoping to see more improvement in his area in particular. Their academics are challenging and rewarding. I feel prepared academically for graduate school as I look on toward more practical living experiences in an apartment or home.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2018-01-24T00:42:19.596441Z","guid":"a4c5075b-ed87-4a1c-8e14-72d6fe6e812d","rating":4},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":3.66}],"photos":{"default":{"crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/43e93ee6f5b628b26705b7e12fee3002a038fe0a.jpg","MobileHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/b015f6533ba30b9359b96a5b0885e45b5c2f22fc.jpg"},"licenseName":"UNLICENSED"},"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-85.496906,40.458382,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-85.496906,40.458382,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.6705882352941175,"count":1020},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Upland, IN"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/taylor-university/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"d7a347a3-2d4a-4312-bff1-c0e26d828872","content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"Georgia College & State University","type":"College","url":"georgia-college--and--state-university"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.8452},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":19717},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"1030-1220"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Freshman","body":"My absolute favourite thing was how everyone was so friendly here! All the staff were very nice and helpful whenever I had any issues, which wasn't often in the first place because everyone was so helpful. Lots of my teachers seemed genuinely invested in how I was doing in their class and at GCSU in general.\nThe only thing I ever had an issue with was the mathematics department. Most teachers in that area did seem to care, but oftentimes I found they weren't able to teach the material quite as well as teachers in other areas. It would either be extremely difficult, with teachers going completely over my head, or very, very easy, with the teacher practically going back to basic high school math. It'd be nice to see some more focus on that area and to see it improve some.\nBut overall, this college has a very welcoming and warm environment and I'd recommend it to anyone looking for a good start to college. Just maybe don't come here if you want to be a math major.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2018-05-14T16:31:27.18293Z","guid":"b45e32d1-4501-4f01-a345-234a7cf1a0e9","rating":4},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":3.33}],"photos":{"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-83.231962,33.082787,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-83.231962,33.082787,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.6914529914529917,"count":1170},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Milledgeville, GA"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/georgia-college--and--state-university/#scatterplot"}}]}
