I have not visited many other colleges before so I am not going to say that this is the best one, however I am going to say that it is a great school. The atmosphere is nice, the campus is beautiful, and there are many things to do on campus. The facilities are all very nice, modern, and clean, and there is almost always something to do on campus. I was actually faced with the opportunity to transfer to another school that would be closer to home, but I just couldn't bring myself to doing it because this school did not compare to Andrews. \nAnother thing about Andrews is that it is very diverse--that is one of the major things that I enjoy the most. I have many friends from the united states, Brazil, Rwanda, Kenya, China, Russia and many other people.

It was easy to get involved around campus, and being involved led to a great, paid internship opportunity on campus. My internship and classes allowed me to test different career paths and focus on my interests.\r\n\r\nI was thankful for the small campus size, especially in the winter or when I was running late for class.  It was great seeing my friends around campus. \r\n\r\nManor was affordable, supportive, and lots of fun!","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2016-06-17T11:10:47Z","guid":"4c6e2a37-b819-4b9b-8809-eebaa1241570","rating":5},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":3}],"photos":{"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-75.103749,40.086409,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-75.103749,40.086409,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.806451612903226,"count":124},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"2 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Jenkintown, PA"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/manor-college/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"a975f856-cc59-420a-84bf-0b57b7d42e1c","content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"Johnson College","type":"College","url":"johnson-college"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.5962},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":18059},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"870-1170"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"College Junior","body":"My Freshman year at Johnson College can be described as nothing more then AWESOME!  The professors were actually there to teach, listen, and to answer all my questions.  The Professors have one purpose, and that is to\r\n\r\ngive the student(s) the education that is needed to make a real difference in the world.  What I also liked is the job placement with local firms/businesses in my field of Drafting and Design. The registration process was simple. Tons of helpful information and assistance when needed in applying for financial aid.  Not the big campus run around from one office to the next.  Everything simplified!  I love this college, and as a result my GPA is 3.8.  This college is a perfect fit for me!","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2016-01-04T21:04:31Z","guid":"34ba9332-149d-4eda-a0de-efdffa61f836","rating":5},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":3.66}],"photos":{"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-75.642476,41.450409,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-75.642476,41.450409,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.945945945945946,"count":74},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"2 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Scranton, PA"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/johnson-college/#scatterplot"}}]}
