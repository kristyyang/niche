While working on my associates degree, I was able to take classes that easily transferred over to fulfill my bachelors degree requirements. This was very helpful to me because I didn't want to be put back in the 4 year college track. Saint Xavier also offers many scholarships and makes it very easy to set up a non interest payment plan throughout the year. What I would change about the school is that I would offer a greater variety of courses. I would also enjoy having more lounge space in the hallways since many of the students and myself are commuters. Furthermore, I would recommend the school to invest in finding a way to add more parking space because parking is always filled and very hard to find. Overall, I really enjoy the atmosphere and the small school setting, because the professors, students, and alumni are very welcoming and kind.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2017-10-12T19:26:36.229331Z","guid":"9b6614dd-2dbe-493c-ae0f-33d84487500c","rating":4},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":2.66}],"photos":{"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-87.713507,41.707763,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-87.713507,41.707763,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.5204819277108435,"count":830},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Chicago, IL"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/saint-xavier-university/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"1cf0e982-b968-4438-bf8d-ba78e7dadd32","content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"Eastern New Mexico University","type":"College","url":"eastern-new-mexico-university"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.5731},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":10481},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"776-1046"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Junior","body":"Great university!

I see lots of different schools and interact with dozens of student populations. Each campus has a different vibe and feel, and conversations in campus coffee shops range from purely academic to purely social. I loved Middlebury for the blend of high caliber academics, a hardworking student body, and a focus on active, healthy lifestyles. Students at Middlebury balance work and play, and a weekend was never without hours in the library or miles of hiking, running or biking. The teachers have high expectations for your work, but they understand there's more to get out of college than acing every exam. As I tour college campuses today, I look for candidates who strike that same balance, who take their work seriously, but they don't take themselves too seriously.

My best advice for those that are thinking about coming here is that if you thrive in a chill and relaxed environment, then this is a great place for you! The campus is dead most of the times, so if you are looking for a party school do not come here.  Overall I think the university is great for on campus activities, the knowledgable professors and the small classroom sizes.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2018-05-19T18:57:31.166016Z","guid":"ce0e148d-3991-4838-96a5-c765e70a87c3","rating":4},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":2.66}],"photos":{"default":{"crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/3d4e203434169bc3a3125077b2be973409504bc0.jpg","MobileHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/badf7c1f0fb7e98ffbc11258dc12d2d67564face.jpg"},"licenseName":"UNLICENSED"},"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-155.081329,19.701854,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-155.081329,19.701854,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.2812121212121212,"count":825},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Hilo, HI"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/university-of-hawaii-at-hilo/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"c8ff6f6a-a5f0-4595-83e4-21d52fd11fc9","content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"Dallas Baptist University","type":"College","url":"dallas-baptist-university"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.4311},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":24669},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"1030-1190"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Niche User","body":"My Experience with Dallas Baptist so far has been exceptional, I am going to attend the University in the fall to study and play soccer and I'm super excited!
