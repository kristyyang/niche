All the professors are wonderful and really know how to teach vs just read off a PowerPoint. I felt safe on campus everyday. I did take biology anantomy and psychiology and that was the only class I would say is really tough because the professor only reads off a PowerPoint and nothing she says is on her tests, but every other class was awesome. If you can take a class with Eric Ash you will love it! Places around campus to eat at we’re all decently priced and great food. I commuted so I’m not sure how on campus food is. Don’t buy a parking pass. Load money on your one card and pay that way it will save you money.

Furthermore, this college provides students with easy access to multiple rooms where students can study, write papers, and do group projects without any distractions. Although the college is near downtown Brooklyn where plenty of traffic takes place it provides the students to get use to a fast life style while attending a college in New York City. The surroundings of the college can also help students obtain internships at many company's that have a strong relationship with the New York City College of Technology.

So make sure you build a relationship with them - they may be able to write an amazing recommendation or get you a job after you graduate!

The clubs and organizations are welcoming and always have a project going--which non-members are always welcome to participate in.  Football is big in the south so game day is always a must.  One of personal favorite experiences of my time at Troy was watching the band (we have an AMAZING band).  My housing (Trojan Village) was fantastic!  As with any college, it has its share of issues--parking is a big one--sometimes you will hear uncomfortable stories about the older dorms and every once an a while someone would get something gross at the dining hall but these few slips are to be expected anywhere.  As far as academics my classes are small, personal, and most of my teachers are beyond great.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2018-04-02T21:55:59.407644Z","guid":"82779b0d-b2cc-4f6b-bd37-94a1b428e898","rating":5},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":3}],"photos":{"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-85.950191,31.800128,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-85.950191,31.800128,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.6317626527050613,"count":1719},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Troy, AL"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/troy-university/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"04b96d74-4243-448d-b842-0c4e6a1dfe97","content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"California State University - Dominguez Hills","type":"College","url":"california-state-university---dominguez-hills"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.4791},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":3297},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"760-940"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Senior","body":"Dominguez Hills has paved the road for my physical therapy career.

Weather you like hiking, mountain biking, skiing, paddle boarding you name it then CMU is the right choice for you.

I got involved at the Foy Fitness Center in an aerial silks class. I really appreciated that the two instructors were involved with each student and pushed each of us to the best of our abilities. I also got accepted into Sigma Kappa, the new sorority on campus. Being in Sigma Kappa was the one of the best things that had ever happened to me. It formed me into a social butterfly and allowed me to really help out in the community. The women of Sigma Kappa came together to host events with other sororities to bring people together for charity. Being at APSU has transformed my life in the most amazing ways.

I am a proud to call Jackson State my home and ALMA MATER!","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2018-05-01T20:03:04.271861Z","guid":"e51f3247-c1da-4fcd-aecc-ba9439deecbf","rating":5},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":2.66}],"photos":{"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-90.20663,32.296781,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-90.20663,32.296781,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.5740585774058578,"count":1195},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Jackson, MS"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/jackson-state-university/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"a6fee292-a097-47f9-bd8e-783a24bb99c2","content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"Indiana University-Purdue University - Fort Wayne","type":"College","url":"indiana-university-purdue-university---fort-wayne"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.9326},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":7270},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"860-1080"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Freshman","body":"IPFW is a very welcoming campus.

Plus, it's right in downtown! I am part of a honor society for STEM majors and they provided the opportunity for me to do scientific research, and I am in my freshmen year! (also getting a stipend for it).  The university is also down the block from the world's largest medical center (hint hint pre-med and pre-nursing students)!  As for the social life, one can say that students do somewhat lack  is school spirit because it is a commute school so once students are done with classes, they leave. However, it is easier to get involved because of the small environment! I work as a personal trainer at the campus recreation center and I am also part of the orientation team. So I would say that I have been very blessed here at UHD! As my freshmen year is coming to an end, I realize I would not want it anywhere else.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2017-05-02T03:05:10.684442Z","guid":"8c797fd7-4723-4a75-9867-45043f56349a","rating":4},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":3}],"photos":{"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-95.35953,29.763831,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-95.35953,29.763831,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.7091237579042455,"count":1107},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Houston, TX"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/university-of-houston---downtown/#scatterplot"}}]}
