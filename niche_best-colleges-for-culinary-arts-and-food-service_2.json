There is a wide range of subjects that are offered, so odds are that you will find the types of classes you are looking for.

They make it matter. Located in Brookline, MA, just 15 minutes outside of Boston, I am able to have the small hands on college experience I want, without having to live right in the city. On the weekends I am able to leave my satellite dorm in historic Coolidge Corner, and head into Boston by T to get to Fenway, the museums, or TD Garden. The professors on average have 15 plus years experience in their respective fields, guaranteeing that I am learning the most up to date information in my area of study.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2017-02-17T17:29:03.360646Z","guid":"27d19c86-e1cd-4c7d-94f8-952bbd076410","rating":4},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":2}],"photos":{"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-71.142082,42.331032,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-71.142082,42.331032,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.58974358974359,"count":234},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Brookline, MA"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/newbury-college/#scatterplot"}}]}
