The events and programs on campus are almost all student lead  and developed, so all of the events benefit students of all backgrounds and interests.  There is always something to do on the weekends, and if nothing interests you specifically, their is always an opportunity for you to organize an event to reach out to students with the same interest; all with the support of whatever club/organization you choose to go through.  The campus is all about expanding its influence into the community and helping those in need.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2018-01-10T18:31:44.551923Z","guid":"5d5c0d01-e395-40c1-a999-4959f1d4455c","rating":5},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":3}],"photos":{"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-75.88833,41.243204,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-75.88833,41.243204,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.396414342629482,"count":502},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Wilkes-Barre, PA"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/wilkes-university/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"000bb920-cee5-4a1b-9a23-672b8abddac1","content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":true,"isPremium":true,"name":"Palm Beach Atlantic University","type":"College","url":"palm-beach-atlantic-university"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.9337},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":23444},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"930-1170"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Freshman","body":"Palm Beach Atlantic University is a Christian Private School dedicated to it's students.

I love my HBCU and will definitely recommend to anyone to attend.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2017-12-30T09:46:11.122467Z","guid":"8c1dc942-b0e2-4ff1-bb96-08e884655138","rating":5},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":2.33}],"photos":{"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-84.14306,31.571395,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-84.14306,31.571395,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.6028823058446755,"count":1249},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Albany, GA"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/albany-state-university/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"1d5b13f0-4223-40dd-a647-282410d0fb58","content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"Mount Saint Mary's University (CA)","type":"College","url":"mount-saint-marys-university-ca"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.8592},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":27134},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"820-1020"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Alum","body":"Mount Saint Mary's University is an amazing place to receive your education, but you MUST take full advantage of ALL the services it provides to students.

At the opening-of-school ceremony, all of the incoming freshmen carried candles signifying we should strive to be a \"light in the world.\" I believe I am studying among students who are focusing on their studies, trying to do their best in school, and wanting to make a difference in the world beyond college.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2018-02-18T04:46:58.533499Z","guid":"bdb45ee1-9862-4583-bd09-7863e580406f","rating":5},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":3}],"photos":{"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-81.60706,30.350349,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-81.60706,30.350349,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.6066066066066065,"count":666},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Jacksonville, FL"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/jacksonville-university/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"ba584809-7c16-45c5-8d4d-bbb61c31cea3","content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"University of Mount Union","type":"College","url":"university-of-mount-union"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.7699},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":22728},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"890-1110"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Freshman","body":"I love Mount Union because the atmosphere is very friendly. I think many people assume because Mount is an expensive college, the students will be stuck up snobs. This is completely untrue. I have found the complete opposite to be true really. I come from a low income household and paid for college completely through scholarships and grants. Never once have I felt lesser because of my socioeconomic status. Everyone I've interacted with have been exceptionally kind to one another. As funny as it is to say, the one thing that sticks out in my mind is the extreme lengths students go to to hold doors for others. The professors are always available and are able to relate well with students. Course material is difficult, but the atmosphere is full of resources and encouragement. I love being a Raider!","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2017-12-29T18:48:39.480277Z","guid":"73da08d2-0c06-4b75-a6f3-dd0533a62108","rating":5},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":3}],"photos":{"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-81.108624,40.905093,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-81.108624,40.905093,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.4296228150873964,"count":1087},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Alliance, OH"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/university-of-mount-union/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"3dac1572-8d55-4c8e-8f1d-6afd1556b42a","content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"University of Evansville","type":"College","url":"university-of-evansville"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.7089},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":22068},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"990-1220"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Junior","body":"I have loved my college experience here. The small class sizes, individualized courses, and professors who actually care about your success.
