The community they've built on campus is amazingly homey and comforting.

When you come in as a freshman, you get to do great beginnings which is basically just a giant ice breaker and really helps to get you started in that homey vibe.

Prior to coming here, I was highly indecisive between Mississippi State and Ole Miss. After my first visit to MSU, I was completely in love with the academics, campus, and town! I will forever be a huge proponent for MSU, and everything that it has have to offer. MSU has offered me so much just in the two semesters I have been here. I am majoring in Kinesiology, and every single of one the professors in this department are so helpful, and truly want to watch each student succeed. The professors in this department are particularly wonderful in assisting their students to get into grad school. Additionally, I have had a number of ways to get involved and volunteer for different organizations. I love seeing the diversity here at MSU, and at the same time realizing that we are all here for one goal, and that is being taught to be well-rounded professionals for “the real world”.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2018-04-13T19:30:25.532473Z","guid":"89d45621-9f52-41bc-b46c-9c9bee3a797c","rating":5},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":4}],"photos":{"default":{"crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/c0937e3ef5ea37e17fe1c8fe728abe009ee6ecc4.jpg","MobileHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/f5136c486c1d7aee0938da37d874c8f2c90d108e.jpg","Thumbnail":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/ade2bf07163c70dccd621ad6a5ced5dd4ff0ce24"},"licenseName":"UNLICENSED"},"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-88.78834,33.455241,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-88.78834,33.455241,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.843767011431682,"count":1837},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Mississippi State, MS"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/mississippi-state-university/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"b81bcc1a-38e4-469e-aee1-2084c9d7f43d","content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"University of Connecticut","type":"College","url":"university-of-connecticut"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.488},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":19064},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"1120-1340"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Junior","body":"I like UConn because it really gives ample opportunities for anyone to pursue their interests and diverge further in that field. It is very diverse with people from all around the world. The professors are very helpful and there is a common theme of \"the mission to education\" where every person is working with another to improve the educational experience for everyone. \nAlthough having large classes might be an advantage for some people, it minimizes the interaction between the students, which could be improved. Students don't interact very well in classes and rely on extracurricular activities or living on campus to get to know more people. Additionally, another area where the university can improve is the campus food!

The campus is beautiful and everyone is so welcoming.  I felt at home the first time I visited and automatically I knew UK was the school I wanted to attend.  There's a whole week of activities in August before classes start specifically for incoming freshman to get them acclimated to the university and show them everything UK has to offer.  There are numerous tutoring services and most professors are flexible with their office hours to find a time that works for the student.  Almost everyday there's a different activity happening on campus, from goat yoga and Pinterest parties for stress relief, to live music and food to spend time with friends, to tailgates before sports games to support our Wildcats with the most spirit.  It's clear that the university strives to create the best environment for students' success and well-being.

To summarize, the University of Arizona is an amazing opportunity for anyone looking to get a world-class education in an environment where employers often come directly to you.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2018-03-01T03:25:26.123698Z","guid":"092f1096-7bb8-4ba8-852f-05209f1ef07f","rating":4},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":3.66}],"photos":{"default":{"author":"iagoarchangel","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/50d9d513c48381c6ba4939908c60bbd3ac3a4631.jpg","MobileHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/0c9c05adf4b9e9ce85277fdbe92468b57d06a2e7.jpg","Thumbnail":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/375760a6d8ec09f2b2b89cb9f9f2d14e6e577f2e"},"licenseName":"CC BY-SA","licenseUrl":"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/","sourceUrl":"https://www.flickr.com/photos/iagoarchangel/8608390310/"},"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-110.950769,32.232071,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-110.950769,32.232071,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.7181506849315067,"count":5840},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Tucson, AZ"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/university-of-arizona/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"c323725c-f4bb-49c3-90d4-e35b25c46a29","content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"University of California - Davis","type":"College","url":"university-of-california---davis"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.4228},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":16039},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"1050-1330"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Sophomore","body":"Davis empowers its student body by encouraging cultural awareness by hosting International Week, providing study abroad programs (and financial aid), having gender-inclusive restrooms throughout campus and the Student Community Center with a Cross-Cultural Center and LGBTQIA Center, a safe place for all students to hang out or study.

Keep up the good work USU!","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2018-04-28T02:34:51.274997Z","guid":"a92c12b3-6c6e-40a0-a5e9-0f295ef4cdb2","rating":4},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":3.33}],"photos":{"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-111.81391,41.740748,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-111.81391,41.740748,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.8143459915611815,"count":4029},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Logan, UT"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/utah-state-university/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"e10a097f-d982-484e-b167-7032f5e24440","content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"Brigham Young University - Idaho","type":"College","url":"brigham-young-university---idaho"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.9583},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":8344},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"900-1110"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Sophomore","body":"Brigham Young University- Idaho is located in the little town of Rexburg, surrounded by rolling hills and farm fields. You can really feel at home here in a way few schools can make you feel at home. The campus is beautiful and the people are friendly. There's a quaint apple orchard right outside! The welcoming vibe doesn't end when you leave the campus, though. Even in my online classes, I can feel the warmth of professors and classmates that care about me. Being at BYUI is like being part of a family.

The university is always being renovated and they are bringing in local restaurants, which have some of the best food on campus!

I was apprehensive and nervous about attending such a large, well-known university, but I now feel more comfortable here. I have been making good grades so far (3.5 GPA) and all of my teachers have been very open to student communication. I can tell that they genuinely want to help their students succeed. My only prominent complaint is all of the construction on campus. Maneuvering through the dirty sidewalks and the one-way streets outlined in cones can be annoying. However, I know that the finished structures will improve academics and student life in the long run, and I cannot wait to see what else Sam Houston State has in store for me in the coming semesters!","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2018-01-23T01:02:48.321036Z","guid":"e5c995ca-32df-4ee5-944c-f24faa7da61e","rating":5},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":3}],"photos":{"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-95.5519,30.7247,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-95.5519,30.7247,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.6463759021022906,"count":3187},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Huntsville, TX"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/sam-houston-state-university/#scatterplot"}}]}
