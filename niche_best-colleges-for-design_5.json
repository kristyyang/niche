It is not a typical college campus with brick buildings and grassy fields. It's nestled in the city of Richmond where you have a diverse and dynamic mix of students, city dwellers, artists, and everything you can imagine! I would never trade this for another \"typical\" school. In terms of academics, everything is accessible through student tutoring sessions, group review sessions (highly advisable). It's challenging (especially if you do the Honors College), but worth your while. THe study abroad programs are EXCELLENT. I did 2 of them myself, and definitely recommend it-- they find a way to finance whatever study abroad you want to do, through their scholarship office. \nI only take 1 star away because I was a commuter and did not enjoy VCU as much as the residential students. However, the commute is also highly doable and there is a lot of parking available to students. Honestly, VCU is the way to go.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2018-05-01T08:37:43.300365Z","guid":"f71873d8-b412-454c-be0c-5f8da8fc5baa","rating":4},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":3.33}],"photos":{"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-77.453597,37.547631,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-77.453597,37.547631,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.6626812515899263,"count":3931},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Richmond, VA"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/virginia-commonwealth-university/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"2a28f074-6504-433d-b6fe-d180aa92717b","content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"Otterbein University","type":"College","url":"otterbein-university"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.7287},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":23945},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"1010-1220"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Senior","body":"Awesome academics with many internship opportunities.

The academic aspect is amazing as well. There are over 700 majors to choose from. Many of these programs are world renowned, and they're engaged in helping students attend higher levels of education. Another highlight of Queens College is the resources it offers to its students. There are tutoring centers, Counseling services, athletic opportunities, and so much more. It's definitely a college to look out for when applying.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2018-03-07T17:57:21.237414Z","guid":"b8c8114c-6e1b-4488-b9e1-9e29aca415e1","rating":5},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":3.33}],"photos":{"default":{"crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/125c76ed14edcf7752b8e71770450afff7b4ad46.jpg","MobileHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/c452fcefe2a286f8f6e44558bee4d6f67606d2d7.jpg"},"licenseName":"UNLICENSED"},"mapbox_header":{"crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-73.815387,40.737771,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-73.815387,40.737771,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"UNLICENSED"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.446254071661238,"count":921},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Queens, NY"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/cuny-queens-college/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"62369217-8abf-4ff4-b8db-d1f27dcb1972","content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"University of Central Florida","type":"College","url":"university-of-central-florida"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.4999},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":15533},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"1080-1270"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Senior","body":"My experience at the University of Central Florida is everything that any student that ever dreamed of going to college to ever imagine.

They place a lot of emphasis on academic growth and career success, and many students are offered generous scholarships during their undergrad. If money is a concern for you, I would strongly consider applying and seeing what scholarships you earn, because that was the deciding factor for me when I was in high school. Social life is lacking a bit but improving overall. It's important to get yourself out there and get involved in organizations, people I know in Greek life have also really enjoyed their experience. UTD is fairly close to Dallas and has a modern-type campus with many new buildings recently built. Campus food is excellent now with many options, there is also a full Starbucks store on campus. \n\nOverall, UTD is actually a great school that focuses on academics but has also improved in many other areas recently.

The campus is small, so you get more one on one time in class. This helped me to learn more and made me more confident around my classmates. We were even division II National Campions in football this year! It really boosted morale and made us feel bigger than our small campus. Everything I experienced in Commerce made me appreciate the small campus and I loved every moment. If one can look past the isolated feeling at times, it is a great place to learn and make life long friends.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2018-02-26T04:03:01.217363Z","guid":"db1b03f2-bb49-43cc-93c5-a1f2051a3f7b","rating":4},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":3}],"photos":{"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-95.906913,33.243814,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-95.906913,33.243814,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.6611909650924024,"count":974},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Commerce, TX"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/texas-a-and-m-university---commerce/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"1614aa44-01e2-4ffe-8b2b-c614b1fc2fe9","content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"Lesley University","type":"College","url":"lesley-university"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.6373},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":29276},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"960-1160"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Freshman","body":"The things I love most about Lesley is that the students are creative, accepting, empowered, and open-minded.
