We had a great season which featured playoff appearances as a team, and individually, I started every game and scored two game winning goals as a freshman. My coach put lots of faith in me.

The professors are AMAZING! They are very helpful and supportive. There is a great deal of help all throughout campus, whether it is at the library, mental health services, or financial aid office. This school is also very accepting of all people from different genders, ethnicities, races, etc. I am very proud of graduating from this school. Studnets, professors and staff have all influenced my life and the person I have grown to become.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2018-05-24T05:34:51.280865Z","guid":"8f0a371f-9059-4d6a-a965-7ac9e5cf5592","rating":5},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":2.66}],"photos":{"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-117.158013,33.129115,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-117.158013,33.129115,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.6083776595744683,"count":1504},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"San Marcos, CA"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/california-state-university---san-marcos/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"ae4f33c6-3e0d-4015-96f6-9f94f2bbd789","badge":{"display":"Best Colleges in America","ordinal":676,"total":1644,"vanityURL":"best-colleges"},"content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"California State University - Stanislaus","type":"College","url":"california-state-university---stanislaus"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.7434},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":7557},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"810-1030"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Freshman","body":"I love the space between the buildings of each of the classes because it provides a lovely break from being trapped in a room all morning. I think the teachers provide an enthusiastic teaching environment, and it helps to transition the freshman from being in high school to a whole new environment: college. I love the shade provided on the campus, but I do think there should be more of it, especially with the heat and vigor the sun gives during the summer months of Turlock. Perhaps each graduating class could plant a tree to help promote saving the environment, and make a positive impact as they face the world outside of college!

It is a college where it is affordable and most professors seem to care about you and if you are in class of not.  My favorite experiences are it has been easy to make true friends, be involved, and not feel overwhelmed with the size.

If I hadn't chosen to come here I would have never discovered my passion for social justice issues. Without Plymouth, I wouldn't have ever thought about standing up for so many issues that need to be talked about. Thanks to Plymouth I'll always have a school that backs me on my choice to step out and speaks up.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2018-04-11T19:35:16.448001Z","guid":"9163c377-70a6-4739-9e5f-777ec17ebc1e","rating":5},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":2.66}],"photos":{"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-71.691164,43.757386,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-71.691164,43.757386,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.466666666666667,"count":810},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Plymouth, NH"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/plymouth-state-university/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"e6e390ca-d054-4103-96d4-d520349cdd82","content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"Midway College","type":"College","url":"midway-college"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.6032},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":23802},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"710-870"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Freshman","body":"Midway College has been a perfect fit for myself. Midway is based in the center of an historic town. The setting of  Midway College is peaceful and they could help with relaxation when dealing with stressful studies. Midway is continuing to advance everyday. Midway is now co ed which can improve students way of being social. Yet, the college has a classroom size of 18-20 which allows students to have more interaction with the professor.

Actually, I was so anti-AU that I was considering every other school, even super religious ones (which is interesting b/c I'm not very religious). AU didn't fit my perception of what college is supposed to be like; a big school in warm weather & far away from home. Well, PLOT TWIST! I chose AU b/c it's affordable. After my 1st week of classes, I let really myself experience the school -- w/o any judgements. The moment I started identifying all the positives at AU was the moment I started to love this university. The campus is gorgeous & well maintained, the staff goes above & beyond to help students, the community is so welcoming, & student-life is thriving. Everyone here is truly amazing! After having completed 1 semester here & getting involved in all that my schedule prevails, I have no regrets on choosing this university as the one to complete my degree at. I love the atmosphere, the education offered, & all the opportunities! :)","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2018-03-05T23:48:38.218504Z","guid":"0193d4c0-615e-4647-beac-7e5b1d94fed8","rating":5},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":2.33}],"photos":{"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-88.349469,41.754465,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-88.349469,41.754465,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.452681388012618,"count":634},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Aurora, IL"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/aurora-university/#scatterplot"}}]}
