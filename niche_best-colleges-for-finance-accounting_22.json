IUP has a strong network of professors from a variety of backgrounds and experiences, which allows for a multitude of learning opportunities.

The university aims to have a very diverse community of faculty and students, which it successfully accomplishes through its various academic programs and events.

The faculty will be willing to present you with what kind of opportunities are available to you, but you have to be the one to pursue them and find out which one is right for you.\nYou also need to keep an eye on is your finances. They won’t pursue you, you need to pursue them periodically in person to see if anything is amiss. Technology is temperamental in ways they might not even be aware of. \nAnother thing I love is their willingness to just talk with you as a person.

I have not had a bad experience with any nursing professor, and some have even become friends.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2018-04-25T18:30:55.347783Z","guid":"49fdb668-8001-4db7-9dcd-086b1319ba80","rating":4},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":2.66}],"photos":{"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-75.356718,39.86158,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-75.356718,39.86158,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.4615384615384617,"count":663},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Chester, PA"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/widener-university/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"ad8533ff-f853-4f8f-b89c-16944b083dad","content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"Northern Michigan University","type":"College","url":"northern-michigan-university"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.7587},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":12667},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"760-940"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Freshman","body":"I am born and raised in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan. Going to Northern Michigan University has not been a big change in venue and that! I love the setup of the campus, everything is very easy to locate and everything is in walking distance from the residence halls. I also enjoy how incoming freshman are able o have cars on campus, it's a big help to be able to get home more often. There are a few things that Northern Michigan University could improve on. The parking situation is one of them, although they have added multiple lots to help the problem. Another item that could be better is the dining areas. They could have more of a selection of food throughout the week, which they are also changing for the Fall semester of 2018!","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2018-02-27T18:40:46.249035Z","guid":"f0a072ca-b35a-4bf0-8876-8d38f248e77d","rating":5},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":2.66}],"photos":{"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-87.403857,46.558037,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-87.403857,46.558037,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.5866099893730072,"count":941},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Marquette, MI"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/northern-michigan-university/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"3d6df1a2-1cd4-45b1-a4c8-af21bcd69a1d","content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"Cumberland University","type":"College","url":"cumberland-university"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.4891},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":20753},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"830-1030"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Freshman","body":"Cumberland University fits perfect for my situation.

The only things that I would fix are some of the dorms and the food in the cafeteria but you would probably want to fix those things at most schools!","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2017-12-31T03:19:13.20315Z","guid":"4b2ed9ef-1723-4ac5-a74d-d23f3a530345","rating":4},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":2.66}],"photos":{"default":{"crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/d2d24c76a72730c0e6b037285ff3af8b9bdcb231.jpg","MobileHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/65796a67d9f0191f63fd3a25f17f509003b4682e.jpg"},"licenseName":"UNLICENSED"},"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-86.865099,33.10625,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-86.865099,33.10625,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.574404761904762,"count":672},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Montevallo, AL"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/university-of-montevallo/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"0972131f-a656-411c-bb0b-6d2750d8b031","content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":true,"isPremium":false,"name":"Clarke University","type":"College","url":"clarke-university"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.6493},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":23787},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"856-1060"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Niche User","body":"I really loved the location of the college.  it is located in Dubuque near the bluffs and a river, and is also about 5 minutes away from downtown.  The campus itself is very old, but is newly renovated which gives it that antique feel.  It used to be an all women college, but has recently been opened up to men.  The architecture of the buildings is spectacular, and even more impressive, the school has underground tunnels!  I'm going for nursing, and the program guarantees you're out in four years with a degree which is extremely satisfying.  There are also a lot of hospitals near the campus which makes it super easy to complete my clinicals.  The only problem I have with the overall atmosphere is that it is still a blossoming campus, so it is quite small.  I'm from a small town so I'm familiar with the small-town feel, but it would be nice to be apart of a campus with more students at some point in the future.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2017-01-30T15:38:10.925906Z","guid":"6170eace-605b-49ef-814a-a23e385a18af","rating":4},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":2.66}],"photos":{"default":{"crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/fab1d8508676876a6778f15f5ba87c8d6fa832da.jpg","MobileHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/4ad0c7b5da1160250f3a0006ba1d9c92fc7264c7.jpg"},"licenseName":"UNLICENSED"},"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-90.691512,42.508619,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-90.691512,42.508619,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.592833876221498,"count":307},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Dubuque, IA"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/clarke-university/#scatterplot"}}]}
