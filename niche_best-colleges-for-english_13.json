There's a wide variety of students here that guarantees ease in finding friends in classes and other places on campus.  There's also so much to do every week!  JMU offers so many organizations and clubs to join as well as fun activities for the whole campus to join in on.  The reason I didn't give JMU 5 stars is because there are some small difficulties that arise for me throughout the school year. For example, it is very difficult to register for classes and get all the classes you need to satisfy graduation requirements, especially as a freshman.  Also, because JMU is a smaller campus with a growing student population, there are always very long lines for food, for example, because they cannot cater to every single student.  These are just a few examples of small problems I face on campus, but overall, I love JMU!","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2017-12-24T17:09:20.796054Z","guid":"679eb716-52a9-4dfc-b4f9-a74c15bfe27b","rating":4},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":4}],"photos":{"default":{"crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/4db870c879f0c6df1a1e3ba4ff31e994f951edad.jpg","MobileHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/3a5ac8236426e56afa157a1ec322d5838b863cae.jpg","Thumbnail":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/c349de8eee19ea6f15f0642d0d8b16418148cac0"},"licenseName":"UNLICENSED"},"mapbox_header":{"crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-78.871663,38.435332,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-78.871663,38.435332,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"UNLICENSED"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.7404946474713916,"count":2709},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Harrisonburg, VA"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/james-madison-university/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"5661693d-f152-4d12-b65f-f318532a03d5","content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"University of St. Thomas - Minnesota","type":"College","url":"university-of-st-thomas---minnesota"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.8266},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":30791},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"1050-1290"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Freshman","body":"First off, all of the Teachers are amazing, they're office doors are always open and they're willing to help!

There truly is a group for everyone. Students are well taken care of, and the University holds its name in high regard with good reason. Looking for a party? Don't let the Catholic mission fool you. St. John's has as many opportunities to balance social life and academia inside and outside of her walls. Indulge in free fairs, activities, games, amusements, food, and refreshments. Academia in SJU is guided by deans and advisors of your choosing in your given college but remember, like in any college and a lesson to hold throughout your years: fight for what you want!","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2018-06-03T05:48:06.645741Z","guid":"44f4c2a8-2371-4698-b0b7-0943ac8feee4","rating":4},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":3}],"photos":{"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-73.795301,40.721979,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-73.795301,40.721979,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.606974209952779,"count":2753},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Queens, NY"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/st-johns-university---new-york/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"62369217-8abf-4ff4-b8db-d1f27dcb1972","content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"University of Central Florida","type":"College","url":"university-of-central-florida"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.4999},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":15533},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"1080-1270"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Senior","body":"My experience at the University of Central Florida is everything that any student that ever dreamed of going to college to ever imagine.

It was fun doing them and I'm going to become morr involved next semester. I learned in Adelphi some things I didn't knkw about myself and it really opened my eyes to all the new skills I've developed throughout a short period of time.

The teachers are great, paying attention to the needs and desires of every student. The atmosphere is also beautiful, with views of both Mount San Jacinto and the San Bernardino Mountains. The campus is extremely diverse with people from all over the world. It is a great place to be yourself and express yourself without having to hide. It is also a very religious campus with a large emphasis and focus on God and a person's relationship with God. Overall, the school is pretty good, I would recommend it!","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2017-01-19T05:10:51.094545Z","guid":"bc9a3f93-c7fe-4b40-bfa1-eee19b883307","rating":4},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":3}],"photos":{"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-117.497071,33.908834,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-117.497071,33.908834,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.491778774289985,"count":669},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Riverside, CA"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/la-sierra-university/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"19156948-0891-4637-9bf6-2b7e489aacc6","content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"Ohio University","type":"College","url":"ohio-university"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.7485},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":21899},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"990-1200"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Sophomore","body":"Ohio University is more than just the four years you are here. It's about the lasting memories you make and knowledge you gain. While it is a bit taunting to go out and enjoy the social and bar scenes around campus, OU is all about time management. It's very hard to get caught up in the fun of things and forget about academics. But it is most certainly not impossible. If students take their time here, and use the networking and resources that are available it is absolutely amazing the places you can go. The oppritunities are so beyond contrary belief.  \n\nCollege has been the best time of my life, Ohio University has already opened so many doors for so many and it just keeps growing and getting better.
