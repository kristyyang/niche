The people here are awesome. If you want a place where you can walk across campus and know 10 out of the 20 people that you just walked past, this is the place for you. The professors care about you and your education, and about what you are doing as a student to further your experience in the classroom. Campus is small, and the closest 'big town' is about ten minutes away, but you can always find things to do and people to do them with if you try hard enough. If you don't think a big school is for you, then SAU might be a good option! Our CORE program does a really good job of getting new students hooked up with a student mentor and a group of fellow classmates from the first day on campus. You get to grow with this group and you might find that some of those people will be your good friends.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2017-01-23T21:51:30.56762Z","guid":"7da6c56d-c755-40aa-ab52-6dfe796b878f","rating":4},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":2.66}],"photos":{"default":{"crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/cfbd055fdf88698a3021c1fb1c275238f3a3cd8d.jpg","MobileHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/04ce8326585f3ef8285079f8ba1d89d66e5fc71f.jpg"},"licenseName":"UNLICENSED"},"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-84.551918,42.206233,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-84.551918,42.206233,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.6422764227642275,"count":738},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Spring Arbor, MI"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/spring-arbor-university/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"1a78b6e5-fe24-443a-967d-40079fd070ff","content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"Pomona College","type":"College","url":"pomona-college"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.0944},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":18140},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"1340-1540"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Sophomore","body":"I'm only a sophomore, but I've gotten involved with research for all four semesters, received internship funding, had expenses for two conferences paid for, was actively involved in an award winning Mock Trial without any experience, and learned how to play the violin through free private music lessons.

The academic experience is robust, with professors who love to teach and peers who love to learn. The Claremont Colleges add so much depth, and each is distinctive enough to venture out to and seek out new perspective. I had my choice of attending a world-renowned university over here, but I could see the difference in how the undergraduates were valued.

The community is student friendly & provides free food, discounts, & job opportunities for college students!\n\nI wouldn’t trade my experience at HSU for the world.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2018-02-23T21:53:49.722843Z","guid":"56d5e358-2d3b-4707-a2f9-a5f7f1dfb6ca","rating":5},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":2.66}],"photos":{"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-99.733815,32.476786,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-99.733815,32.476786,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.684684684684685,"count":333},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Abilene, TX"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/hardin-simmons-university/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"c45e7144-d7cd-4ee0-a779-641ea23d6215","content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":true,"isPremium":true,"name":"Southwestern Assemblies of God University","type":"College","url":"southwestern-assemblies-of-god-university"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.2347},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":25466},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"800-1030"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Senior","body":"Southwestern Assemblies of God University is the type of place where you just feel right at home and welcomed as soon as you arrive.

Upon reading this, you may seem a bit skeptical seeing as how its an \"Assemblies of God\" campus which in your mind is summed up as \"reserved, strict, and overall an anti-'good time' living.\" However, although the University are somewhat strict and frowns upon most cases of going out partying and drinking and has a curfew during the academic year, the atmosphere on each of the halls I wouldn't describe as anything less than family-like. Living on a small campus may seem to some as a disadvantage, but it enables you to become familiar with almost everyone on the campus which can have several benefits.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2017-08-13T23:14:44.135853Z","guid":"c23abd0c-7514-4861-aa73-4c8c0ccf947e","rating":4},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":3}],"photos":{"default":{"crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/3450c186f2426028217f0b432a634602c173e950.jpg","MobileHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/56c01a9ba1a806b7680647697b1d21f332479944.jpg"},"licenseName":"UNLICENSED"},"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-96.85315,32.405477,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-96.85315,32.405477,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.9687092568448503,"count":767},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Waxahachie, TX"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/southwestern-assemblies-of-god-university/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"0c1bbdd2-6245-43ce-bb41-aa3e3273feb7","content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"Texas Wesleyan University","type":"College","url":"texas-wesleyan-university"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.4116},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":19804},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"925-1070"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Junior","body":"Texas Wesleyan is an outstanding private University!

It is a school that not only excels with excellent professors and campus life, but a school that takes your purpose and morphs it into a future.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2018-02-22T20:37:12.806526Z","guid":"a6824192-ced9-4bce-b046-6315a01728c5","rating":5},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":3.33}],"photos":{"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-117.900911,33.662686,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-117.900911,33.662686,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.759305210918114,"count":806},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Costa Mesa, CA"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/vanguard-university-of-southern-california/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"0da98a11-3f7d-47af-83c5-8a510dce1dc8","content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":true,"isPremium":false,"name":"University of Mount Olive","type":"College","url":"university-of-mount-olive"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.4766},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":15063},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"1020-1150"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Freshman","body":"Applying to UMO was a very short and easy process.

I was highly concerned over what UMO could offer me financially due to having a family that cannot easily support me. The Admissions Representative promised to try to get as much help for me as possible so I would be able to attend. Within a week of applying, I was accepted with a financial package!

The classes are all academically demanding, so as long as you try and do your work, you should be fine! Student life is pretty good as the RA's and CA's, as well as the clubs and organizations around school, come up with some fun events and activities that everyone can enjoy! It honestly is very easy to make friends, especially if you live in the dorms. UST offers some great academic programs and they are very generous when awarding scholarships.

As with every school, it does have its pros and cons, but all-in-all, your time spent here is going to be well worth it.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2016-12-20T17:36:38.487154Z","guid":"e33a7126-7e25-4d5c-a9d0-37b691ca0c80","rating":5},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":3.33}],"photos":{"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-95.394178,29.738113,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-95.394178,29.738113,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.5983050847457627,"count":590},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Houston, TX"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/university-of-st-thomas---texas/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"4755f8e4-ceeb-4aa3-a493-893bc7e3dd79","content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"Sul Ross State University","type":"College","url":"sul-ross-state-university"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.9222},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":14095},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"730-949"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Junior","body":"It is an amazing school! It is great for my field of study, as well as different people or different places. Professors are great at teaching and helping students learn the material. There is the one on one teacher, student ratio that helps the students learn better. Campus is beautiful and has amazing weather. I am on my own but not too far from home.

As a student wanting to grow in my education as well as my Christian faith, this place has helped me become the person that God has created me to be. I am going into my sophomore year of college, and I was so excited to come back! It is home to me. The small class sizes allow me to get to know more students and my professors on a first-name basis. There is not much that I would recommend they change.
