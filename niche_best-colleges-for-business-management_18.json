Academically, WCU exists as only one of two colleges to offer a minor in leadership -a highly recommended 18-credit program for all. The School of Stage & Screen is one of the nation's top programs for anything theatre, and members of the school will stress this (however, the school's undertakings speak for itself). The Honors College just celebrated its 20th anniversary, and continues to stand out among higher ed institutions for its dedication to research and involvement.

It's also a good size to get from one end to the other, unlike some of the \nlarge campuses I'd seen. The grounds are well-lit, clean, and pretty. There are a number of housing options once you decide you're done with dorm life, including many homes for rent in the area. I like that we are taught by the professors and not aides. I appreciate that we don't have to be entered onto a waiting list for entry into specialized studies pertaining to our majors. I do feel that Whitewater athletics should be recognized more statewide, as we have some of the best athletes/teams around! The student enrollment is diverse, allowing interactions with people not only from around the US but the world! And tuition is more affordable than some of the other state universities, yet we get the same (or better) educational offerings. My experience with UWW has been very enjoyable.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2017-11-05T15:32:20.832692Z","guid":"459f27a1-bebe-444b-bd0e-0daa5bb56f06","rating":5},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":3}],"photos":{"default":{"crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/377333c08fe7891f2723cf399dd03a2977a17962.jpg","MobileHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/6b205393e1ddcb9e045bd0682a63f3ff4b421836.jpg"},"licenseName":"UNLICENSED"},"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-88.742368,42.835563,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-88.742368,42.835563,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.535,"count":1200},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Whitewater, WI"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/university-of-wisconsin---whitewater/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"32a609ce-ac46-4e27-a2aa-eaff68a7a8b7","content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"Flagler College - St. Augustine","type":"College","url":"flagler-college---st-augustine"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.5505},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":22727},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"960-1150"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Junior","body":"Flagler College is a great school with a beautiful campus!

On orientation day the staff made me feel so welcome, everyone was so friendly, and not because they had to be, it was truly genuine! The actual DEAN of my department spent over an hour with me helping to map out my first semester by going over different course selections available for me, helping to make sure I didn't waste time or money picking classes that would not benefit my intended major. The academics are challenging and many employers see Stockton University as a highly credited institution to graduate from. I highly recommend any student looking for a college where they will easily fit in and belong. There are so many activities to keep busy and because Stockton is situated in the heart of South Jersey, its relatively close to anything you could need.

He loves the school and the key is to get involved with sports, clubs, volunteering, study groups, and social activities in the dorm.

However,  if you are looking for a solid school that is on the smaller side with a beautiful campus located in a resort town and personalized attention from professors then you should check out Salve Regina.

UIC is clearly diverse, but not inclusive. I have heard stories of qualified students of color being passed over for white students.\nThe are a plethora of scholarship opportunities to assist low-income and first generation students. I took out loans the first two years, but received a full-ride the last two years.\nAbout 90% of my profess were intellectually stimulating and very friendly. They welcome students during office hours and actually want to see you succeed. The advisors are the BEST! They are very supportive. The business career center is a great asset of UIC. The advisors help students find internships and full-time jobs after graduation.\nOverall, I would rate UIC a 8.2/10. They are definitely lacking in the social aspect and should coordinate more vibrant events.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2018-04-26T17:56:19.949051Z","guid":"98e81e06-7ce2-4632-a8e7-b9e4a199bc1d","rating":4},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":3.66}],"photos":{"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-87.651145,41.872651,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-87.651145,41.872651,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.5712780898876404,"count":2848},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Chicago, IL"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/university-of-illinois-at-chicago/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"21f8641e-453a-43ad-9945-eec60c6d7031","content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"University of Detroit Mercy","type":"College","url":"university-of-detroit-mercy"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.784},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":22382},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"960-1280"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Freshman","body":"So far, my experience here has been amazing! \nThe classes are interesting and just challenging enough to the point where I have to work hard, but not so challenging that they're impossible to keep up with in addition to my life. \nThe campus, while small, is very nice, with a fitness center available to all students and a library including a cafe.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2018-02-16T14:50:21.401156Z","guid":"8d75678e-ab74-4419-89ca-7e8d1b5fa564","rating":5},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":3}],"photos":{"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-83.138369,42.417168,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-83.138369,42.417168,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.519543973941368,"count":614},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Detroit, MI"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/university-of-detroit-mercy/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"0892d6f3-5af9-4f2f-97b1-dfdc6e9107f3","content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":true,"isPremium":false,"name":"Simpson University","type":"College","url":"simpson-university"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.5215},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":20574},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"860-1105"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Sophomore","body":"So far, my experience at Simpson University has been great.
