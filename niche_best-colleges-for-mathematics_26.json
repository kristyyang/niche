Each of your professors are invested in your future and success, and are devoted to helping you learn what you need to learn, and provide you with the resources that  you will need to succeed.

But that is what makes Elmhurst the best college to go to! Having a small number of students in your field of program such as Elementary Education is crucial. That means there are not that many graduates from a great college looking for a job in the same area as you. You are able to build a relationship with each of your professors because the class size is about 20 students. Having a real connection with your professor means they get to know you and you get to know them. They will be great references or write great recommendations for whatever you need. In addition to professors, you create long lasting friendships with your peers. Everyone becomes close and you  support each other to get through the semester. I recommend applying to Elmhurst College first. It can be competitive to get in, but that is because they should be your number one choice!","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2017-01-20T21:53:23.668045Z","guid":"2d55ff0b-095b-48bf-8332-698f999e5716","rating":5},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":3}],"photos":{"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-87.946096,41.899215,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-87.946096,41.899215,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.5140845070422535,"count":710},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Elmhurst, IL"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/elmhurst-college/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"37b0b5c4-ff20-4d65-902b-a429dffc1053","content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"University of Pittsburgh - Johnstown","type":"College","url":"university-of-pittsburgh---johnstown"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.7426},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":17804},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"910-1130"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Sophomore","body":"The University of Pittsburgh at Johnstown is a very relaxed, yet engaging campus. The people and staff are welcoming, helpful, and hard working. The campus is comforting with its acres of woods surrounding it, and safe.

The services offered here are great, ranging from career assistance, tutoring, to health and fitness. My favorite part about the campus, and also the first thing I noticed was the many critters running around.

There's little spots to eat around town and lots of hiking opportunities. The professors are kind and easy to talk to. The small class size is one of my favorite things because all of my professors know my name and we form a nice student teacher relationship.

However, if I really had to say one thing that could change it would be something as small as providing more cheap and healthy food choices around campus.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2018-03-05T00:09:26.253476Z","guid":"e6812564-5e0d-45ce-a9e8-90f88197c91e","rating":5},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":3}],"photos":{"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-112.160021,33.60726,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-112.160021,33.60726,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.85929648241206,"count":199},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Glendale, AZ"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/arizona-state-university---west-campus/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"26e7b9f4-18e1-4bad-9c9e-679fa6b30212","content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":true,"isPremium":false,"name":"Concordia University - Wisconsin","type":"College","url":"concordia-university---wisconsin"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.6335},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":25764},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"898-1156"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Junior","body":"I really enjoyed and appreciated the immediate warm welcoming I received on my very first visit to the campus.

Saint Xavier also offers many scholarships and makes it very easy to set up a non interest payment plan throughout the year. What I would change about the school is that I would offer a greater variety of courses. I would also enjoy having more lounge space in the hallways since many of the students and myself are commuters.

Every time  I visit the campus, it seems more diverse and of course, that’s inspiring. I was a business major but the liberal arts aspects - learning to think deeply and to constantly question the answer with a critical view - is what this school is about. This school opens you up to making connections in material and in the real world. I went straight to NYC for a decade, two weeks after graduating from SMC. I will say that St Mary’s is a bubble; the school isn’t so much about teaching street smarts, but you can easily learn all things academic here, if you choose. Getting involved is key, too.

The support and love I have felt at this school has truly changed my life and I am beyond grateful for PLNU!","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2018-05-17T04:38:46.898478Z","guid":"b79da9ae-26c4-4112-ab81-f8893deb7031","rating":5},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":3.66}],"photos":{"default":{"crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/63312fcc4d4613832d10c84f51115e56e0478dc3.jpg","MobileHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/a4e11420e29437ebe12bb870c7583dd6640ce063.jpg"},"licenseName":"UNLICENSED"},"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-117.251204,32.713295,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-117.251204,32.713295,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.6842105263157894,"count":912},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"San Diego, CA"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/point-loma-nazarene-university/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"19b49afe-66c6-4b98-ab8d-44676b2c5372","content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"Capital University","type":"College","url":"capital-university"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.6923},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":20676},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"950-1180"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Alum","body":"Good academics and faculty, most professors are super helpful! Class size is pretty small, good for someone who likes student faculty interaction and ask questions. On campus life, the student body is pretty conservative. ROI is good if you study hard, no problem getting a job in public accounting for me. The downside is the food, it has gone downhill like 2 years ago since the operation got outsourced to a different company.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2018-01-20T00:44:47.088203Z","guid":"8dce985a-e527-4374-bdeb-49e1c02c2364","rating":5},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":2.66}],"photos":{"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-82.937867,39.954875,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-82.937867,39.954875,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.575685339690107,"count":839},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Columbus, OH"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/capital-university/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"d362130b-10d2-4a6a-8383-778916645da0","content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":true,"isPremium":false,"name":"University of Redlands","type":"College","url":"university-of-redlands"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.7475},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":34200},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"980-1190"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Freshman","body":"I'm just starting out as a freshman and so far I'm really pleased with the school. For starters its so pretty and green! There's so many clubs to get involved in (I joined social affairs and I'm loving it). There's a lot of things to apply to become like an orientation leader or a tour guide or a CA, I plan on doing them all. I was unsatisfied with the on-campus job options because I didn't get the one I applied for and they didn't have very many left at that point. Im currently doing note-taking for 2 classes but the pay is low.
