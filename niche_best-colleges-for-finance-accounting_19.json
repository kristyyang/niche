If you want to start a project, do research, get internships, or help out in the community, you have to have some initiative but it pays off. I got a really cool internship through the career services and completed a fulfilling work-study.\n\nI took classes and electives in several departments outside my major, including education, communication and psychology, and I gained a lot of practical knowledge. Professors are intelligent, funny, and made learning feel less like work. Definitely recommend the senior capstone project required by several majors because it gives you the research and writing skills needed to do a master's thesis project closely supervised by faculty.\n\nStudent body is quiet but has a lot of neat interests and passions. The college could do more to bring that out, but there's a lot of potential.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2017-07-11T18:37:09.679548Z","guid":"476b0a9b-ac4a-420c-b193-a7b5d224093b","rating":5},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":2.66}],"photos":{"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-81.251817,41.717841,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-81.251817,41.717841,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.4285714285714284,"count":175},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Painesville, OH"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/lake-erie-college/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"2b312623-ad6e-4931-b97b-12e4376ec13a","content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"Wilkes University","type":"College","url":"wilkes-university"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.7592},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":25025},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"895-1130"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Junior","body":"Wilkes offers a high class education with dedicated staff and faculty.

The campus is beautiful and constantly undergoing new development and improvement.  Connecting with campus is seamless as each club and program is more than willing to accept new team members to help organize events and bring out the colonel spirit.   The events and programs on campus are almost all student lead  and developed, so all of the events benefit students of all backgrounds and interests.  There is always something to do on the weekends, and if nothing interests you specifically, their is always an opportunity for you to organize an event to reach out to students with the same interest; all with the support of whatever club/organization you choose to go through.  The campus is all about expanding its influence into the community and helping those in need.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2018-01-10T18:31:44.551923Z","guid":"5d5c0d01-e395-40c1-a999-4959f1d4455c","rating":5},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":3}],"photos":{"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-75.88833,41.243204,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-75.88833,41.243204,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.396414342629482,"count":502},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Wilkes-Barre, PA"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/wilkes-university/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"32a609ce-ac46-4e27-a2aa-eaff68a7a8b7","content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"Flagler College - St. Augustine","type":"College","url":"flagler-college---st-augustine"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.5505},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":22727},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"960-1150"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Junior","body":"Flagler College is a great school with a beautiful campus!

While working on my associates degree, I was able to take classes that easily transferred over to fulfill my bachelors degree requirements. This was very helpful to me because I didn't want to be put back in the 4 year college track. Saint Xavier also offers many scholarships and makes it very easy to set up a non interest payment plan throughout the year. What I would change about the school is that I would offer a greater variety of courses. I would also enjoy having more lounge space in the hallways since many of the students and myself are commuters. Furthermore, I would recommend the school to invest in finding a way to add more parking space because parking is always filled and very hard to find. Overall, I really enjoy the atmosphere and the small school setting, because the professors, students, and alumni are very welcoming and kind.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2017-10-12T19:26:36.229331Z","guid":"9b6614dd-2dbe-493c-ae0f-33d84487500c","rating":4},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":2.66}],"photos":{"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-87.713507,41.707763,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-87.713507,41.707763,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.5204819277108435,"count":830},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Chicago, IL"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/saint-xavier-university/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"5efd3575-e136-48cc-a461-6f278c3beb5f","content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"Hampton University","type":"College","url":"hampton-university"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.6482},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":24377},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"860-1040"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Sophomore","body":"Through my freshman year at Hampton University, I have learned that in order to enact change is like pulling teeth. The administration has been intact for some 40 years, therefore it is very difficult to get things such as food quality, dorm maintenance, and events to change for the better. Although this year was a very academically rigorous year, it did lack in other areas. In the aforementioned areas, students had to organize a sit in protest in order to have our voices and concerns addressed. Academically speaking, Hampton University is not lacking at all, well, at least in my experience. All of my professors were professional, thorough, and cared about the well being and academic journey of their students. Entering my sophomore year, I look forward to how this illustrious institution will grow, or decline!","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2018-05-18T18:54:22.157176Z","guid":"ae3e8cc6-c609-4a16-ae37-ca3c5f628c1a","rating":4},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":2.66}],"photos":{"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-76.337647,37.022084,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-76.337647,37.022084,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.189840944073884,"count":1949},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Hampton, VA"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/hampton-university/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"2b15541d-7892-425e-8687-13ae02e2f925","content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":true,"isPremium":true,"name":"Franklin College","type":"College","url":"franklin-college"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.61},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":22031},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"940-1480"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Junior","body":"I love Franklin College because they've given me the opportunities to be successful and excel in my career field.

For off-campus activities, the city of Philadelphia is just 10 minutes away by train. There are also apartments within a 5 minute walk of campus where students can live for an affordable price. There aren't many food options, so it's best not to buy the meal plan. Lots of scholarship money available for financial aid. Overall, Arcadia is pretty great.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2018-04-16T17:34:07.674186Z","guid":"c53177c4-aa46-414d-a7fd-99970c04351f","rating":4},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":2.66}],"photos":{"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-75.165205,40.091941,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-75.165205,40.091941,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.268965517241379,"count":1160},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Glenside, PA"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/arcadia-university/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"acad5fe1-f327-427a-9635-32ece63a0c0c","content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"Lynchburg College","type":"College","url":"lynchburg-college"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.6378},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":23692},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"920-1120"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Senior","body":"I absolutely love my college!
