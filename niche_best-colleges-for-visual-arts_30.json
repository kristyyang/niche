Whether that’s through freshman activities, great professors, or just awesome, nice people, Concordia is extremely welcoming to everyone and anyone. Oh and I can’t forget to mention how awesome free parking at the university is! \nI would, however, change the policies pertaining to the hours that boys/girls can be in each other’s dorms. I think that this policy should be different because by the time we get to college, we are adults. We should be capable of making our own mature decisions pertaining to the opposite gender. \nThe smallness of Concordia is one of its positives and negatives. It is a good thing because of how easy it is to know your fellow students, athletes, faculty, and even the president of the university. The negative of the smallness of the school is that everyone knows everything, word travels very fast.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2018-01-03T16:43:38.630766Z","guid":"d8e0a378-269a-4587-8b87-0fb383cd5cc8","rating":4},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":3}],"photos":{"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-97.089054,40.914853,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-97.089054,40.914853,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.672316384180791,"count":354},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Seward, NE"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/concordia-university---nebraska/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"b0580b80-9d0d-4e6f-b807-27dcc07c7472","content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"Cardinal Stritch University","type":"College","url":"cardinal-stritch-university"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.8152},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":17289},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"930-1083"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Freshman","body":"I'm a nursing student at Cardinal Stritch University and it's been a great ride so far!

It's just such a beautiful school, and I couldn't imagine going anywhere else.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2018-02-09T19:00:26.03858Z","guid":"2415bb96-1fd9-422c-af15-e12535bac022","rating":5},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":3}],"photos":{"default":{"crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/6853d7cf865d74c07f7a8484bc88a7ef669964b6.jpg","MobileHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/14eda8ee3ca1879cae32eeec6132d1c6c4df41f0.jpg"},"licenseName":"UNLICENSED"},"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-86.191642,41.677671,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-86.191642,41.677671,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.87374749498998,"count":499},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Mishawaka, IN"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/bethel-college---indiana/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"e6775634-735b-47f2-808f-2aa89daf9120","content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":true,"isPremium":false,"name":"Hastings College","type":"College","url":"hastings-college"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.6394},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":19871},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"890-1010"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Freshman","body":"Hastings college is a particularly great school in the sense of how great the people are.

There are always events going on that are generally open to the students and the food at the Shoebox and Underground is simply fantastic.

It is also very nice to have everything so close on campus... not big at all, so if that is a big factor for you Elmira College is definitely a great choice!","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2018-03-15T20:50:32.509998Z","guid":"9d376b09-8d76-429e-bb60-62410b9bdf4b","rating":5},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":2.33}],"photos":{"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-76.811333,42.092724,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-76.811333,42.092724,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.341113105924596,"count":557},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Elmira, NY"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/elmira-college/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"1abdb91c-a3c3-4b50-9d2c-0d7464c67b42","content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"Lyndon State College","type":"College","url":"lyndon-state-college"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.9834},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":15587},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"840-1060"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Junior","body":"What I loved about Lyndon State College was that the student to professor ratio was 15-20:1. The professors are willing to work one-on-one and help you succeed. There is many resources available such as tutors, and the academic support center which helps students prioritize, schedule classes, and learn how to effectively study. The academics are optimal and require professionalism and the programs expect high quality, to their best effort out of the students. The community is very open and willing to help anybody. Lyndon gives the opportunity for students to be an athlete while having their main focus on school then sports after. There is many activities to do on campus from student life scheduling opportunities. Activities off campus also includes skiing, hiking, etc. Lyndon provides the optimal opportunity for school and fun, all while receivin the college experience.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2017-12-27T17:32:30.395408Z","guid":"05283d51-b253-4fbb-87ce-3c7896280321","rating":4},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":2.33}],"photos":{"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-72.024563,44.53433,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-72.024563,44.53433,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.34,"count":250},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Lyndonville, VT"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/lyndon-state-college/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"51a8a818-b9de-4e30-b9b9-acfd16032e05","content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":true,"isPremium":false,"name":"Transylvania University","type":"College","url":"transylvania-university"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.9482},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":23685},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"1040-1300"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Sophomore","body":"I absolutely love this university. Many classes are discussion-based, making them very engaging. Campus is small & it only takes about 5 minutes to walk to class from most dorms. Lexington is a wonderful place to be, although pretty unsafe, which leads me to say that the safety on campus could improve, but that will likely happen soon as a result of an attack that occurred earlier this year. Dining locations on campus currently have unusual hours & sometimes students find that they want food when dining locations are closed, but Lexington as a whole has several nearby restaurants students can order from with their own money. Also, many cheaper housing options were closed down for next year so students will live in the brand-new dorms, which makes it harder for students to find affordable housing. Overall, though, I'd recommend this university to anyone who wants to go to a smaller school and/or live in a bigger city, and especially to artists because Lexington is a very artistic city.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2017-07-27T01:57:05.316293Z","guid":"4c908b63-69b0-4011-af13-ff14c0f24b5f","rating":5},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":3.33}],"photos":{"default":{"crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/8f36cce8c68337eb4666ce7eb7df61d7c92fc0bc.jpg","MobileHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/60571fb9bf154b85b95af6b752884503de2a182d.jpg"},"licenseName":"UNLICENSED"},"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-84.493883,38.053236,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-84.493883,38.053236,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.7111111111111112,"count":270},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Lexington, KY"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/transylvania-university/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"305f34bd-c28b-45a5-8767-25ad1cd6f5dd","content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"Olivet College","type":"College","url":"olivet-college"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.5335},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":20973},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"870-1180"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Sophomore","body":"Olivet College is a very nice school all together.

Now that it is no longer a Girls Only School, my dream has come true!","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2017-08-19T07:32:01.380983Z","guid":"b7469134-c992-435f-b344-7f56678d6c0f","rating":5},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":2.33}],"photos":{"default":{"crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/3c9c0ecf5eca9aa351fd50d971390577b87c16b8.jpg","MobileHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/2426933832ee3d9d53bc26e017732247da1c22ce.jpg"},"licenseName":"UNLICENSED"},"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-79.068325,38.154799,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-79.068325,38.154799,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.3397312859884836,"count":521},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Staunton, VA"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/mary-baldwin-university/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"a0ffa30d-2f22-4d4d-ae42-d8f64bbed884","content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"William Woods University","type":"College","url":"william-woods-university"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.7017},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":22611},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"860-1120"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"College Sophomore","body":"My overall experience at William Woods University has been spectacular so far! It's best known for its equestrian programs, but no one bats an eye if you're not involved with horses either. It's very friendly and diverse (I feel like there is a representative of every type of person here, and we all mesh together just fine), and since William Woods is such a small college, the professors have more time to form enriching relationships with students, and no one feels swamped by an overwhelming student population. If I had to do everything all over again I would return to William Woods every time.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2016-09-18T21:18:51Z","guid":"70c3a402-1312-459d-a0ce-54d75a489c4f","rating":5},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":3}],"photos":{"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-91.949273,38.857864,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-91.949273,38.857864,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.5669291338582676,"count":381},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Fulton, MO"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/william-woods-university/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"8c2c8dae-8089-4f57-9750-762bb3535ceb","content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"Lakeland University","type":"College","url":"lakeland-university"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.554},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":21210},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"810-1000"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Sophomore","body":"My overall experience at Lakeland has been an adventure and a half. The teachers and faculty are always willing to lend an ear and a hand when you find the right people and pursue the help you know you need.\nThe opportunities through and at Lakeland are many and I love to explore what's available to me as there seem to be more options popping up every day. But, again, you need to seek them out. The faculty will be willing to present you with what kind of opportunities are available to you, but you have to be the one to pursue them and find out which one is right for you.\nYou also need to keep an eye on is your finances. They won’t pursue you, you need to pursue them periodically in person to see if anything is amiss. Technology is temperamental in ways they might not even be aware of. \nAnother thing I love is their willingness to just talk with you as a person. If you are just looking for a person to talk to and chat with, then they are more than willing if they have the time.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2018-01-01T00:32:08.056758Z","guid":"62ee1167-d4c8-4db2-9805-abba2bbdd21f","rating":4},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":2.33}],"photos":{"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-87.884956,43.841863,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-87.884956,43.841863,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.5238095238095237,"count":336},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Plymouth, WI"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/lakeland-university/#scatterplot"}}]}
