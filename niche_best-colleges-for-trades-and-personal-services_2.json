I had the opportunity to learn from professors who exemplify what they teach, and benefited from hands on experience to implement what I have learned. My professors and the entire college are so understanding, thoughtful, and caring. They want to help you succeed and work with you. They even called me in Florida to make sure I was okay and offer extended deadlines after Hurricane Irma. This is also the cheapest, quickest way to get my degree and really learn my stuff so I can be the most educated, experienced, and effective educator I can be.

I am enrolled in Teacher's College in the Elementary Education Program. I have had the privilege of building long-lasting relationships with classmates and outstanding professors in this program.

I personally love this class size because it allows me to create more meaningful and authentic relationships with my professor in a setting where I can have more one-on-one instruction if needed. With the encouragement and help of professors and my advisor on campus, I have been introduced to the opportunity to travel and teach in England for the summer. I am excited to announce that I have made the decision to study abroad!

Pom poms shake throughout Bryant Denny Stadium and each spectator is completely invested in Alabama's sports teams. Moving 18 hours away from home was extremely nerve-racking but Alabama could not feel more like home. The amount of scholarship offered to out-of-state students is amazing and helps combat the high cost.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2018-04-10T19:02:12.236272Z","guid":"040f2331-f244-42bf-9627-e453172c9bff","rating":5},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":4}],"photos":{"default":{"crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/72d468d49a692298481d0fd444598807a8e348ce.jpg","MobileHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/e8b3f3c3a38131d336c2949319f659484199b5ba.jpg"},"licenseName":"UNLICENSED"},"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-87.545766,33.2144,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-87.545766,33.2144,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.8969047038752134,"count":4103},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Tuscaloosa, AL"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/the-university-of-alabama/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"0b914389-d868-4ecf-970e-60ac8353dde1","badge":{"display":"Best Colleges in America","ordinal":195,"total":1644,"vanityURL":"best-colleges"},"content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":true,"isPremium":false,"name":"University of South Carolina","type":"College","url":"university-of-south-carolina"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.6814},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":19913},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"1120-1300"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Freshman","body":"I am an out of state student attending USC for the first year of pursuing a 4 year degree. In the beginning I was uncomfortable with my transition and unable to feel at home. Through clubs and sports teams I was able to develop new friendships and life skills that made me feel more at home. There are so many opportunities presented to students at USC that all should take advantage of. One of the most important things that is clearly valued here, is academics. My professors so far have been some of the most passionate people I have met. A favorite course I have taken here has been environmental ethics. I took this course as a philosophy requirement and it inspired me to change my major to environmental studies. The professor and the course material inspired me to make a decision that I will not soon regret. I am more than happy to say that I am a student at USC. If someone decides to attend school here, I bet they will say the same thing.

The community they've built on campus is amazingly homey and comforting. There are always people willing to talk to you and it's a smaller school so there aren't a million people on campus, which helps. When you come in as a freshman, you get to do great beginnings which is basically just a giant ice breaker and really helps to get you started in that homey vibe.

It's still small enough to see friends around campus, but big enough to give students the sense of freedom every young adult is looking for when leaving home for the first time. With that, the architecture is beautiful. The hilly streets and tree covered parks add to the breath taking sights as well. It has a great variety of majors, including some of the highest ranked schools in the nation: Kelly, Jacobs, and a few others. Indiana University also includes a number of outstanding graduate programs that have been ranked among the best in the United States. On top of the outstanding scenery and large variety of academics, Indiana University also offers tons of great social groups. This includes a very large Greek life community and practically any club you can think of.
