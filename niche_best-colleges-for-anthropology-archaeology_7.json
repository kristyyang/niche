This school has everything you need and is covered in your tuition. Before college I was looking for a diverse and aesthetically pleasing campus, and this gave me all of this and more. Northridge has one the  best art school in the country. They offer several free tutoring, therapist, doctors, and more. The professors have great credentials and want the best for your learning experience, one just needs to look at their background prior to the class. They do not have the best sport team but this an easy fix to their overall performance. They have a high-tech gym that offer numerous classes, equipment, and facilities. The party scene is great. It is not too much or less but the right amount.

UIC is clearly diverse, but not inclusive. I have heard stories of qualified students of color being passed over for white students.\nThe are a plethora of scholarship opportunities to assist low-income and first generation students. I took out loans the first two years, but received a full-ride the last two years.\nAbout 90% of my profess were intellectually stimulating and very friendly. They welcome students during office hours and actually want to see you succeed. The advisors are the BEST! They are very supportive. The business career center is a great asset of UIC. The advisors help students find internships and full-time jobs after graduation.\nOverall, I would rate UIC a 8.2/10. They are definitely lacking in the social aspect and should coordinate more vibrant events.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2018-04-26T17:56:19.949051Z","guid":"98e81e06-7ce2-4632-a8e7-b9e4a199bc1d","rating":4},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":3.66}],"photos":{"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-87.651145,41.872651,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-87.651145,41.872651,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.5712780898876404,"count":2848},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Chicago, IL"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/university-of-illinois-at-chicago/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"8cd719a3-9f66-4a61-a1eb-f2a312b02acc","content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"University of Missouri","type":"College","url":"university-of-missouri"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.747},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":16317},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"1020-1290"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Senior","body":"University of Missouri- Columbia is a school that allows such a variety of studies that almost anyone can find a major they will enjoy pursuing.

It is not a typical college campus with brick buildings and grassy fields. It's nestled in the city of Richmond where you have a diverse and dynamic mix of students, city dwellers, artists, and everything you can imagine! I would never trade this for another \"typical\" school. In terms of academics, everything is accessible through student tutoring sessions, group review sessions (highly advisable). It's challenging (especially if you do the Honors College), but worth your while. THe study abroad programs are EXCELLENT. I did 2 of them myself, and definitely recommend it-- they find a way to finance whatever study abroad you want to do, through their scholarship office. \nI only take 1 star away because I was a commuter and did not enjoy VCU as much as the residential students. However, the commute is also highly doable and there is a lot of parking available to students.

However, if there are two aspects that I would like to see CSULA improve on, they would be the local area and campus food. I would appreciate it if there were interesting activities to participate in in the local area and if there was a much bigger variety of healthy food choices aside from the food trucks and the food court.

I couldn't BEAR being anywhere else!","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2018-05-26T18:34:40.488877Z","guid":"f6ddd6de-5030-499c-a5f6-13e33b98c114","rating":5},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":3}],"photos":{"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-93.276821,37.197983,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-93.276821,37.197983,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.6702761234434216,"count":1847},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Springfield, MO"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/missouri-state-university/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"7dc03130-954f-43ac-a9e4-1b613ef63ebe","content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"Bloomsburg University of Pennsylvania","type":"College","url":"bloomsburg-university-of-pennsylvania"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.7756},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":16027},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"870-1070"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Sophomore","body":"Bloomsburg University of Pennsylvania is a great school. Since the University is small, it is easy to create relationships with your professors and other students. There are a lot of different clubs and activities catered to an individual's personal interest. The community assistants in the dorms and the apartments are also great! They are there to help you in any way possible and truly care about their residents and their safety. The education received at Bloomsburg University is amazing! It is also a lot cheaper than a private school where you are receiving the same information. I would encourage everyone to apply to Bloomsburg University of Pennsylvania","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2018-04-01T17:52:25.113543Z","guid":"4e96eb3d-a377-439b-a902-6bd1f02cd12f","rating":5},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":3}],"photos":{"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-76.446383,41.007989,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-76.446383,41.007989,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.6014206787687453,"count":1267},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Bloomsburg, PA"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/bloomsburg-university-of-pennsylvania/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"057f0334-d050-40cc-8c53-ded9965a328d","content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":true,"isPremium":false,"name":"Oakland University","type":"College","url":"oakland-university"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.8635},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":12198},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"805-1110"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Freshman","body":"I love Oakland Iniversity. The staff and students are all so very friendly and helpful. If you have a question about anything, there is always someone here to help you out.  The Honors College staff are exceptional and extremely helpful.  It doesn’t matter how busy they are, they always make time for you and make you feel important. The informational session for the Honors College was so helpful in helping me make my final decision to attend here at Oakland University. Everyone here is so approachable and kind. The classrooms are very nice, not to mention the Oak View Honors dorms! This is a beautiful building and has very nice dorms. This is my new home and I cannot say enough about how much I love Oakland University.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2018-05-22T15:18:05.389064Z","guid":"da55ae83-8873-4431-ad77-7e55441c147e","rating":5},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":3}],"photos":{"default":{"crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/38bb3c2a072a04df0ce139e7a6302e149971ae26.jpg","MobileHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/00242be1486640f3bb87d5c367426eec7e83c9a1.jpg"},"licenseName":"UNLICENSED"},"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-83.218866,42.672586,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-83.218866,42.672586,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.489578284052351,"count":2063},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Rochester, MI"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/oakland-university/#scatterplot"}}]}
