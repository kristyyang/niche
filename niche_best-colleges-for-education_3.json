It's still small enough to see friends around campus, but big enough to give students the sense of freedom every young adult is looking for when leaving home for the first time. With that, the architecture is beautiful. The hilly streets and tree covered parks add to the breath taking sights as well. It has a great variety of majors, including some of the highest ranked schools in the nation: Kelly, Jacobs, and a few others. Indiana University also includes a number of outstanding graduate programs that have been ranked among the best in the United States. On top of the outstanding scenery and large variety of academics, Indiana University also offers tons of great social groups. This includes a very large Greek life community and practically any club you can think of. Overall, Indiana University will give you a great College Experience!","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2018-03-06T22:10:54.007694Z","guid":"67882c2b-1d0a-4901-b349-6af0c06d2f01","rating":5},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":4}],"photos":{"default":{"crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/384624f1a768b1f1105a87831eb2048f11386291.jpg","MobileHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/4ba85fc5e54092babd4be7cab06641c06ce27a3b.jpg","Thumbnail":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/c349823e87fe38116f01e646076db14a1fa65fea"},"licenseName":"UNLICENSED"},"mapbox_header":{"crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-86.526904,39.166383,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-86.526904,39.166383,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"UNLICENSED"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.744977546679272,"count":4231},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Bloomington, IN"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/indiana-university---bloomington/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"ff985ec0-4353-4309-8616-6e578f1133be","badge":{"display":"Best Colleges for Education in America","ordinal":56,"total":756,"vanityURL":"best-colleges-for-education"},"content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"Martin Luther College","type":"College","url":"martin-luther-college"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.8328},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":18300},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"1080-1380"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Sophomore","body":"I have completed my freshman year at Martin Luther College, and it exceeded my expectations. Being on a relatively small campus allows students to get to know each other easily and create strong friendships. I have enjoyed getting to know my classmates and see them shine in their extracurricular activities. The professors genuinely make time for each student and do what they can to make sure that students fully understand the coursework. The classes are challenging and have fed my desire to become a teacher. The best part of MLC is the bond you create with everyone there through your shared faith. The love for Christ is evident the second you walk on campus and engage in conversation with someone. From the professors, the students, and the other staff everyone is there to build you up and help you become the best pastor or teacher you can be.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2018-05-14T16:31:23.896596Z","guid":"6ebe2d25-b164-41a0-87d0-633493c129ec","rating":5},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":3.33}],"photos":{"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-94.473422,44.3046,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-94.473422,44.3046,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.713235294117647,"count":136},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"New Ulm, MN"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/martin-luther-college/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"b212d30a-2d53-42db-b405-ed141a637592","badge":{"display":"Best Colleges for Education in America","ordinal":57,"total":756,"vanityURL":"best-colleges-for-education"},"content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":true,"isPremium":false,"name":"Arizona State University","type":"College","url":"arizona-state-university"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.825},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":13007},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"1020-1280"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Junior","body":"My experience at ASU was an experience like no other. My course and professors all inspired me to find my passion. I changed my major after the first semester; which allowed me to explore the different career paths before I chose my current career goal. ASU truly opened my eyes to a lot of wonderful opportunities. I am taking my experiences working alongside my peers in the school newspaper \"State Press\" and student outreach \"Programming and Activities Board\" to learn valuable work ethics for future career skills. As a medical studies major, I still find it important to surround myself with other activities and involvements that are not related to my major. Therefore, the school paper gives me sense of the journalism world and the PAB allows me to explore skills in marketing and event planning.

Our athletics are also amazing. I especially like the swimming & diving and volleyball team. They are both so fun to cheer on!

All around, it's my dream University.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2018-03-28T19:01:53.950799Z","guid":"053f6b46-001a-463c-918a-bb2b3715a877","rating":5},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":3.66}],"photos":{"default":{"author":"30791749@N07","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/fb90d2b3ad935c89ade7379fbae247b55fda1dd6.jpg","MobileHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/bcfdc0f48a7c27526977a21dfa677e69b4844f1c.jpg","Thumbnail":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/68d3568efbd5aaba40447846736fa48571b1d802"},"licenseName":"CC BY ","licenseUrl":"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/2.0/","sourceUrl":"https://www.flickr.com/photos/30791749@N07/11540284636/"},"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-97.361537,32.709568,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-97.361537,32.709568,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.85,"count":1460},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Fort Worth, TX"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/texas-christian-university/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"076d6457-e542-40e7-a649-71d8aad57f34","badge":{"display":"Best Colleges for Education in America","ordinal":61,"total":756,"vanityURL":"best-colleges-for-education"},"content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"Whitworth University","type":"College","url":"whitworth-university"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.8857},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":27826},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"1000-1260"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"College Sophomore","body":"I have really enjoyed my experience at Whitworth so far! As a freshman, Whitworth was really great with helping me adapt to the big changes that come with college. Specifically at Whitworth, I have really enjoyed the traditiation for freshmen and all the events that it contained. I really enjoyed the events on campus during weekends. I wish the price could be cheaper so that it was easier to enjoy such a great education at Whitworth. I have met great friends who would probably answer the same as me. Another improvement I think Whitworth could make is making sure that students are able to understand how to get a job once they have finished college. This might be an improvement with the advisers but I think students need help with stress and knowing we can find stable careers out of college that correspond with our majors.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2016-07-13T23:12:11Z","guid":"d41405c1-67df-4aea-88ec-c750f90fc98d","rating":4},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":3.66}],"photos":{"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-117.418078,47.753699,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-117.418078,47.753699,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.9413145539906105,"count":852},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Spokane, WA"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/whitworth-university/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"6e001eef-6195-431a-b281-c944206bc540","badge":{"display":"Best Colleges for Education in America","ordinal":62,"total":756,"vanityURL":"best-colleges-for-education"},"content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":true,"isPremium":false,"name":"DePauw University","type":"College","url":"depauw-university"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.58},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":30863},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"1180-1360"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Freshman","body":"I  will be attending DePauw University next fall and I am more than excited about the opportunities it has to offer.

I would recommend UNL to any prospective college student.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2018-01-11T20:43:26.480298Z","guid":"ac972c2e-9420-40e7-9ee7-f3e0a11b9263","rating":5},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":4}],"photos":{"default":{"author":"ivyfield","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/dcb2fb513e8b6d533b4a4991f0cef81323fb1bde.jpg","MobileHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/4690d091f954f63a1c9b504057710be089e888d2.jpg","Thumbnail":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/43295d3eedc379e04f35377371efecce49167e67"},"licenseName":"CC BY ","licenseUrl":"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/2.0/","sourceUrl":"https://www.flickr.com/photos/ivyfield/6986330897/in/album-72157603879379896/"},"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-96.702177,40.822272,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-96.702177,40.822272,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.674708818635607,"count":2404},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Lincoln, NE"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/university-of-nebraska---lincoln/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"ae22001d-88c2-46aa-8ba6-612846f01024","badge":{"display":"Best Colleges for Education in America","ordinal":68,"total":756,"vanityURL":"best-colleges-for-education"},"content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":true,"isPremium":false,"name":"Calvin College","type":"College","url":"calvin-college"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.7471},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":25446},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"1050-1285"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Sophomore","body":"Your Calvin experience all comes down to perspective. Great professors and challenging classes foster a pretty positive environment for learning. Interim classes may seem like a waste of time, but pick something that interests you and you'll be surprised. Don't slack, work hard, and you'll be fine. Dorm housing is nothing to complain about, being so close to academic buildings. There are solid people at Calvin, but it takes a while to figure social out. If you're not from the area, Dutch, 6\"2, or wear shorts in winter, it may be a little jarring, but there are great people out there. This is college, not high school, you don't need to impress anyone. Most kids grew up in the area all their lives and have known each other forever, so it certainly is a bubble. If you're from out of the country and are used to nightlife, it's painful to watch. Overall, Calvin's a good place that gives you space to develop as a person. Students listen and learn from each other, regardless of opinion.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2018-06-04T10:55:00.15119Z","guid":"af267447-0e53-4cfa-b9f9-113f0decde18","rating":4},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":4}],"photos":{"default":{"crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/100046d6ab5817509ba9ac3135f7d0337810d550.jpg","MobileHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/1b1dd584208ff1a34d63821ab2e269e780a5e0c4.jpg"},"licenseName":"UNLICENSED"},"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-85.587548,42.929916,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-85.587548,42.929916,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.8747044917257685,"count":846},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Grand Rapids, MI"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/calvin-college/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"c3ea35a9-85d8-473b-a511-4f7d71c3b78e","badge":{"display":"Best Colleges for Education in America","ordinal":69,"total":756,"vanityURL":"best-colleges-for-education"},"content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":true,"isPremium":false,"name":"North Carolina State University","type":"College","url":"north-carolina-state-university"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.4751},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":13066},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"1170-1350"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Junior","body":"One thing that I love about North Carolina State University is the amount of diversity and school pride here on campus.

I think NCSU has one of the best engineering and communication programs here on campus and they also have a lot of resources at our libraries and everywhere else on campus. Their database is incredible and the library has so much information for you to refer to when doing research or completing an essay. This University has a strong reputation of academic success as well competitive students, which is makes our school very exciting.

A lot of opportunities for internships, leadership positions and involvement. A lot of research opportunities and very good professors as well, especially for a public university. Despite the perception, OU is a lot more than just football and greek life. However, I would recommend that after freshman year, you live somewhere within walking distance to campus, because the parking here is absolutely awful and you will absolutely regret commuting to campus and spending nearly 2 hours looking for a parking spot everyday, even with a parking pass that costs hundreds of dollars. Also Dale Hall is a ridiculous building and if you have a class there, get there early because trying to make your way through the crowds in that building can sometimes take a while. The parking situation & Dale Hall is the only thing preventing me from giving this great school 5 stars.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2017-11-06T00:20:34.290457Z","guid":"75f25a4a-6e57-4df8-b0a2-0b3897295b1c","rating":4},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":4}],"photos":{"default":{"crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/6a7d7e2d5c708a009e6b4857db0d69cf2efb39c4.jpg","MobileHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/eeb1688e862a426894b97137be0e4145307a7a24.jpg","Thumbnail":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/0dfb8859200ebd86bfb0acaf4b7740bcc6822455"},"licenseName":"UNLICENSED"},"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-97.445692,35.208152,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-97.445692,35.208152,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.7810136157337366,"count":2644},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Norman, OK"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/university-of-oklahoma/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"9d56b986-2303-4209-8b21-669e0cd89cb3","badge":{"display":"Best Colleges for Education in America","ordinal":77,"total":756,"vanityURL":"best-colleges-for-education"},"content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":true,"isPremium":false,"name":"Gustavus Adolphus College","type":"College","url":"gustavus-adolphus-college"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.648},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":24293},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"1080-1340"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Freshman","body":"Wonderful community that fostered both my desire for success and my need for higher education.
