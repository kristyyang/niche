The Spokane area is not the best, most activities are done on campus; Spokane is honestly a little crusty.

Hendrix College can be way too stressful at times, but at the end of the day, there are plenty of resources to help those in need of stress relief. The student housing for underclassmen, however, is abysmal. The dorms are not in the best shape, but there are plans to renovate in the next 5 years. The student Quad is better, yet the walls are so thin you can hear the student above you sneezing. The apartments are better, but they are sometimes a crap-shoot.

From athletes looking for competitive NCAA Division I teams, academias looking for top-notch classes with engaged professors, social butterflies looking for campus involvement and nightlife, they have something for everyone! Although Presbyterian is small, it has a large school social and athletic life, while still maintaining small class sizes so that you get the most out of every experience.

There are plenty of programs that are there to help if you are struggling outside and inside of the school. There are also rewards for students who maintain a GPA of 3.0 and above as well as programs that recognizes students who are not quite at the 3.0 mark bug still shows their ambition to succeed. I think the best part was getting first pick in registration because I am registered with the accessibility center.

The food is okay nothing special, it gets very repetitive. The buses are pretty good, sometimes late but usually on time. Everyone on campus is overall pretty. Although their are sometimes some racial problems, that’s with every school.

First off, the professors and faculty members at Hofstra are there to make sure you're at your best 24/7. There's so many places to go to receive help, it's very reassuring especially when you're having a bad day. Next, the campus and the dorms are nice. The campus is very large which means a lot of walking, but it's not that bad because there's such beautiful architecture and landscaping to look at. The dorms are small and neat, but there's air conditioning which is a major plus. I got to sit through a real college class, which at Hofstra are relatively small. The food at Hofstra has a pretty good selection, but nothing crazy. There are Starbucks, Dunkin Donuts, Subways, Sbarros, and many other places to grab a bite to eat.

The school is making strides towards improving the positive nature of their diversity, which is encouraging during these times of racial tension. Taylor University has a lot to work on financially. Students are unable to attend the university without experience substantial debt as their financial aid programs are lacking. I'm hoping to see more improvement in his area in particular. Their academics are challenging and rewarding.

The professors here really care about your college experience, and the counselors are extremely open to helping you out when you are struggling with your classes/major/whatever it may be.  If there was something that I could recommend that we add to our campus it would be to maybe remodel the interior of the Knight library, because it's definitely starting to fall apart.
