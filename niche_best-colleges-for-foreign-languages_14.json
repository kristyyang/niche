Even though the school is bigger, the MAcc program still has smaller classes and the professors really take the time to get to know you and assist you if you need it. The food options on campus are also awesome.

The campus is smaller than most which allows you to really get to know the other students. It starts to feel more like home once you begin to get to know a lot of people and feels more welcome. Everybody for the most part is friendly and the professor are really interesting and you will definitely learn a lot from them. The campus buildings are all close together so you don't have to walk more than ten minutes to class, which is great! There are multiple clubs and organizations to fit any interest and all of them focus on community and building relationships. The only thing I would change is to have more police officers present at night near the library for people who walk back to their dorms alone.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2018-01-31T18:17:00.628444Z","guid":"068da44f-58a8-49a6-8ad9-9189f7508c82","rating":5},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":3}],"photos":{"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-92.45931,35.078196,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-92.45931,35.078196,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.661257606490872,"count":1479},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Conway, AR"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/university-of-central-arkansas/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"800d1179-6391-4a99-86a6-34e9e975904b","badge":{"display":"Best Colleges in America","ordinal":766,"total":1644,"vanityURL":"best-colleges"},"content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":true,"isPremium":false,"name":"Benedictine College","type":"College","url":"benedictine-college"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.6924},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":24816},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"895-1230"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Sophomore","body":"Becoming a student at Benedictine College has become a great opportunity.

It tends to have a bad reputation, especially from where I come from, but I have nothing but great things to say about it.  Campus culture is very work oriented, many people here are ready to really earn their way to what they want to do.  Eastern is very community based, and that is shown in Ypsilanti, and the kind people around you.  Very diverse student body.  EMU tends to be too focused on the work at times, which is never a bad thing, but we could learn to relax.  You have to work to get the experience that you want.

There seems to be something available for everyone. \nThere are also various opportunities to play a varsity sport or participate in intramural sports. \nThe classes are challenging and push you to think.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2016-12-30T22:11:15.977123Z","guid":"1bd43040-a390-4e63-a0d0-c363bfb2fa6c","rating":5},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":3}],"photos":{"default":{"crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/7339d4a8ac93166e0c31f2ad07c5f8274499863a.jpg","MobileHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/2a9b8969b390a1a7d49f6ab7ed829b24c8c3ba1c.jpg"},"licenseName":"UNLICENSED"},"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-93.563471,41.365503,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-93.563471,41.365503,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.5278688524590165,"count":305},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Indianola, IA"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/simpson-college/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"efd24293-d300-4f65-93e9-dbb7b1b981ba","content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":true,"isPremium":false,"name":"East Tennessee State University","type":"College","url":"east-tennessee-state-university"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.9164},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":14915},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"920-1130"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Senior","body":"Overall, I have been impressed with the type of experiences I have been able to receive at East Tennessee State University. As I am studying to be a future teacher, I have had many opportunities to work with young students at the University School on campus. This has allowed me to gain experience with students by actually doing my lesson plans with real students. Almost all of my professors have been enthusiastic and passionate about the content they have been teaching, which creates a more engaging classroom. The campus has many different options for food and entertainment, with weekly emails about upcoming events. With over 200 student clubs and organizations, there are plenty of opportunities to get involved on campus, make friends, and develop new skills!","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2018-05-04T19:30:36.560392Z","guid":"8736eb2d-2c3e-4a1a-a1d5-f91d959a02b0","rating":4},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":2.66}],"photos":{"default":{"crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/234b885f667940d55c4cf97c66c68ac986caabfd.jpg","MobileHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/c4bbcc2a986339b80984764a6cfea7a03ed13430.jpg"},"licenseName":"UNLICENSED"},"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-82.366954,36.301643,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-82.366954,36.301643,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.598621877691645,"count":1161},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Johnson City, TN"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/east-tennessee-state-university/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"caeeafb2-60f9-4e5a-99ea-c1b77df4bd6b","badge":{"display":"Best Colleges in America","ordinal":848,"total":1644,"vanityURL":"best-colleges"},"content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"California State University - San Bernardino","type":"College","url":"california-state-university---san-bernardino"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.5814},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":6444},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"780-980"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Sophomore","body":"This school is very diverse!
