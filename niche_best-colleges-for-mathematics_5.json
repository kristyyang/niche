I think NCSU has one of the best engineering and communication programs here on campus and they also have a lot of resources at our libraries and everywhere else on campus. Their database is incredible and the library has so much information for you to refer to when doing research or completing an essay.

It's true that Nova isn't a big party school, but I think that's a perk.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2017-12-12T15:01:12.193275Z","guid":"0dd42eff-16d6-4e2b-94fe-4a3f5c27a154","rating":5},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":4.33}],"photos":{"default":{"crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/ca6cc3e8bb92995e7d42f026ae847a02e931cc3e.jpg","MobileHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/815a13eb4d7ef7ab77d2c15e472f67c91cca05d0.jpg"},"licenseName":"UNLICENSED"},"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-75.345457,40.039388,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-75.345457,40.039388,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.669034090909091,"count":1408},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Villanova, PA"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/villanova-university/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"a0f32e0b-7896-407d-ab7c-b96ffe35d307","badge":{"display":"Best Colleges for Math in America","ordinal":108,"total":398,"vanityURL":"best-colleges-for-math"},"content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":true,"isPremium":true,"name":"Gettysburg College","type":"College","url":"gettysburg-college"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.4263},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":34636},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"1200-1370"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Alum","body":"Gettysburg College shaped me into the person I am today!

It's also easy to get involved on campus: there are RSOs for just about any interest, so it's easy to find people with common interests.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2017-04-09T17:50:18.991942Z","guid":"32998311-aa84-4435-ac00-c52986c1d140","rating":5},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":4}],"photos":{"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-88.990622,40.491522,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-88.990622,40.491522,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.6274165202108963,"count":569},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Bloomington, IL"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/illinois-wesleyan-university/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"eb26f5e3-a81b-4fe7-b724-aa502695d935","badge":{"display":"Best Colleges for Math in America","ordinal":115,"total":398,"vanityURL":"best-colleges-for-math"},"content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"Drake University","type":"College","url":"drake-university"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.6895},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":28088},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"1050-1340"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Junior","body":"Drake has been a great experience for me overall! The professors really care about each student's needs and goals, and they are willing to help students at a personal level. There is always something to do on campus and most people I have met (in and out of classes) are nice and outgoing. The campus definitely has a home feel for me. Some downsides are the food (which isn't great) and some of the extra things that come with it being a small school. For example, registering for certain majors can be extremely difficult because of limited class options and there are less options for housing, food, and activities than on a larger campus. Des Moines is also a nice in-between sized city! There is always something to do but it isn't a huge adjustment if you come from a smaller area.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2018-05-31T04:35:19.549811Z","guid":"24632281-62d0-4d5a-909b-f782c1b1f5aa","rating":4},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":3.66}],"photos":{"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-93.654062,41.60381,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-93.654062,41.60381,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.663507109004739,"count":844},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Des Moines, IA"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/drake-university/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"319b5387-5c04-4800-8c43-235676099e04","badge":{"display":"Best Colleges for Math in America","ordinal":116,"total":398,"vanityURL":"best-colleges-for-math"},"content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"College of Wooster","type":"College","url":"college-of-wooster"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.5816},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":29813},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"1070-1350"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Junior","body":"I absolutely love the College of Wooster! When I visited for the first time, I fell in love with the atmosphere of the College. I felt welcomed right away and never lost this feeling. Additionally, I loved that the students seemed to really care about their campus and that most students are extremely involved on campus. This was all clear to me during my tour and then when I sat in on a class, I was sold. The professor I had was engaging and made the rather large classroom (by Wooster's standards) seem much more intimate. I remember hearing students talking about the class and other classes before and after the lecture, which made me realize how engaged in academics students here are. Fast forward four years and here I am typing this review as a junior at the College. I am so happy that I chose the College of Wooster and that every good thought I had about the College has been proven right ten-fold since coming here.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2017-09-28T19:14:11.732478Z","guid":"7151ada7-491c-482a-be1f-89289234009d","rating":5},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":4}],"photos":{"default":{"author":"cogdog","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/c7b22f39c24ab144a0e0d2445bc21b28e7c67cf2.jpg","MobileHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/fecf2c4978a9be0483d19ec59e55c5e28fd10796.jpg","Thumbnail":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/e06a3442f84bca7de61c7a2e58f95766e6633c97"},"licenseName":"CC BY ","licenseUrl":"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/2.0/","sourceUrl":"https://www.flickr.com/photos/cogdog/8763606508/"},"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-81.934674,40.81046,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-81.934674,40.81046,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.536326530612245,"count":1225},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Wooster, OH"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/college-of-wooster/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"16e73fef-82a8-4fe4-ae06-3f1392e31d63","badge":{"display":"Best Colleges for Math in America","ordinal":117,"total":398,"vanityURL":"best-colleges-for-math"},"content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":true,"isPremium":true,"name":"Binghamton University, SUNY","type":"College","url":"binghamton-university-suny"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.4062},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":16540},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"1230-1400"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Junior","body":"I really like Binghamton but there is room for improvement. As a psychology major it is hard to get into classes you need as they close out, even if you came in with a ton of AP credits. Also, so many classes are big so its harder to focus and do well in them. The campus is hilly. Academics are great, i’ve only had one bad teacher. Advising sucks I had to figure everything out on my own. Mountainview dorms were awfull, invisible RA, no community events, unfriendly people etc. Now I live in Newing and I love it and it’s so much better! Many Long Island students, intentational students (mostly from Asia) and Jewish students. You have to find your people at this school but once you do your experience can be great. Also, we don’t have certain majors like education (also communications, and others people complain about) which really sucks but they try to sell you on their grad program. The food is hit or miss, definitely go to the Kosher station since they have the best food.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2018-05-23T01:30:53.174035Z","guid":"98f168b2-72e9-48d0-bb5e-1cc0fdef30f8","rating":4},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":3.66}],"photos":{"default":{"crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/843cc93be5f59a4bf97adb882d92fccaf932660b.jpg","MobileHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/e1bba7684cb59ca91b80ae5381f80c29566dec0c.jpg"},"licenseName":"UNLICENSED"},"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-75.971143,42.088049,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-75.971143,42.088049,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.5464154411764706,"count":2176},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Vestal, NY"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/binghamton-university-suny/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"7506bda8-994b-4e7a-a0b8-cbd64bed03bb","badge":{"display":"Best Colleges for Math in America","ordinal":118,"total":398,"vanityURL":"best-colleges-for-math"},"content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"Union College - New York","type":"College","url":"union-college---new-york"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.369},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":38621},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"1220-1400"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Senior","body":"Review Continued: The social scene is Greek dominated; the Minerva system is an absolute joke.

TAMU is also steeped in traditions that make it an incredibly unique college experience!","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2018-05-28T22:47:05.098811Z","guid":"1bcd4563-84cf-49cf-8e39-de2b0186e8dd","rating":5},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":4.33}],"photos":{"default":{"author":"stuseeger","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/ff5729663bd7a54277d74bd8984e13c49ccf7c45.jpg","MobileHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/7d1b079ee81a8a31c0d2ef4ed9a7a70f12598247.jpg","Thumbnail":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/f676617e01732b695d6b17acf63bafcf2e322892"},"licenseName":"CC BY ","licenseUrl":"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/2.0/","sourceUrl":"https://www.flickr.com/photos/stuseeger/1236808146/"},"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-96.340322,30.613226,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-96.340322,30.613226,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.946622579121398,"count":6351},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"College Station, TX"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/texas-a-and-m-university/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"4355937b-ea83-43fb-b7ee-ed0a6a1e0415","badge":{"display":"Best Colleges for Math in America","ordinal":122,"total":398,"vanityURL":"best-colleges-for-math"},"content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":true,"isPremium":false,"name":"Michigan State University","type":"College","url":"michigan-state-university"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.6574},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":14970},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"990-1260"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Junior","body":"Heyyyyy, so let me tell you about MSU! Michigan State overall is a great school. The campus is very beautiful and spacious. The professors are nice and “most”of them genuinely care about you and how you perform in the classes. The food is okay nothing special, it gets very repetitive. The buses are pretty good, sometimes late but usually on time. Everyone on campus is overall pretty. Although their are sometimes some racial problems, that’s with every school.

Most of all, I was serviced with fantastic one-on-one advisor attention throughout my entire bachelor's course (4 years). Excellent free help labs (economics, accounting) and tutoring services.

Even more so, I love the city in which it resides. Rhodes does a great job of encouraging its students to go beyond campus and experience what Memphis has to offer those who live there. Further, the school is very service oriented, and generally does a great job with connecting students to service opportunities. Unlike at most schools, greek life is a positive addition to the campus, and offers various leadership and philanthropic opportunities for those involved. Additionally, the coursework is manageable, yet still vigorous. Faculty are easily accessible, and class sized are small enough for professors to notice absences. Lastly, and most importantly, the school recognized its past shortcomings on its lack of diversity, and has worked tirelessly in recent years to improve this problem. Overall, the student-faculty relations and the opportunities the school offers makes it a great institution for anyone interested.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2018-03-30T20:19:28.844716Z","guid":"2039a4e4-5dac-4819-95d5-b4b5d0f8916c","rating":4},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":3.66}],"photos":{"default":{"crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/0e49d2a27206780f531f5030705b9e680d5a0bf8.jpg","MobileHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/771c4a2ccffab3b5cc94b2785e7d8826eb1c0be4.jpg"},"licenseName":"UNLICENSED"},"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-89.989187,35.154424,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-89.989187,35.154424,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.5977382875605817,"count":619},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Memphis, TN"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/rhodes-college/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"f2d64ff5-0d0a-4f57-a235-0b6f7af27da9","badge":{"display":"Best Colleges for Math in America","ordinal":126,"total":398,"vanityURL":"best-colleges-for-math"},"content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":true,"isPremium":false,"name":"Iowa State University","type":"College","url":"iowa-state-university"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.8749},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":13623},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"980-1270"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Alum","body":"I graduated from Iowa State as an International Student and it was one of the best experiences of my life; very different from where I am from but excellent overall.
