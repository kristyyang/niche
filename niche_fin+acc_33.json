Due to its small size, you have the ability to know most of the other students that attend the university as well. The small class sizes allow for you to get to know your professor and your professor to get to know you! These relationships are very helpful for classes, internships, and future job opportunities.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2017-02-17T19:34:33.367073Z","guid":"1753e5b2-a613-476b-ba1a-5c133efb038b","rating":4},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":2.33}],"photos":{"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-92.648348,41.308868,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-92.648348,41.308868,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.493243243243243,"count":148},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Oskaloosa, IA"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/william-penn-university/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"46e1550f-969c-4ae7-99c3-79a100677a9b","content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"Bluefield State College","type":"College","url":"bluefield-state-college"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.8331},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":8560},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"870-1070"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Junior","body":"Bluefield State College offers many diverse classes, exceptional instructors, and a an opportunity to achieve your dreams!

This quality of academic achievement is made possible only by an attentive and caring faculty of professors, many of which are expert in their respective fields. Student life at the university is also exceptional. All incoming students are welcomed warmly. The helpfulness of the staff is remarkable considering the fact that each professor is ready and willing to sit one on one with students for discussion. One shortcoming of the university, however, is that, even with its veritable course selection, it offers but one foreign language, that being Spanish.

The school over all was a great school but I feel like the resources that were available especially in the science department, that's where the majority of my time was spent, need to be upgraded tremendously. The school is really trying to satisfy the needs of the incoming students and I appreciate that fact. I met some of my closest friends at AB and it will always hold a special place in my heart.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2017-08-15T15:00:55.199331Z","guid":"66f9b7f5-3f6b-4442-8b85-e8d2274b2996","rating":4},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":2.33}],"photos":{"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-80.047728,39.158067,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-80.047728,39.158067,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.5597014925373136,"count":268},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Philippi, WV"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/alderson-broaddus-college/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"e0870765-4af3-4a76-8155-17fc1ac595e7","content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"McMurry University","type":"College","url":"mcmurry-university"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.4804},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":21516},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"820-1030"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Alum","body":"Coming from a big city, McMurry was the perfect college town for me!
