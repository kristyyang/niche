The leadership in the corp works hard to encourage every cadet to practice the core values by stressing the importance of keeping your 'battle buddies' in check. The corp also has many opportunities to learn and grow as a leader which is why it is known as the \"Leadership college of Alabama.\" Between clubs like White Knights, Honor Guard, Scuba Tigers, and Flying Tigers, (just to name a few) students have an enriching experience that they will always keep with them through their adult lives. The school offers a variety of programs to prepare students for their futures such as the Early Commissioning Program and the Service Academy Program that rocket students ahead of their peers.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2018-01-25T03:02:50.983812Z","guid":"fb26c0a7-f2ac-4890-9967-208675fa6cbe","rating":4},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":3}],"photos":{"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-87.317998,32.622359,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-87.317998,32.622359,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.4705882352941178,"count":51},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"2 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Marion, AL"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/marion-military-institute/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"011acefc-1280-4cda-9575-414e68e3a3ad","content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"University of Maine at Machias","type":"College","url":"university-of-maine-at-machias"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.853982},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":9766},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"820-1050"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Niche User","body":"I went to the University of Maine at Machias about 16 years ago. It was an amazing experience at the University because of the diversity of students, the campus beauty and the overall Downeast Maine atmosphere. Here I sit today going back to the University of Maine at Machias in my early 40's. I decided to change my major and return to school. I am an online student now, however I stay connected in various ways through the school. What I find the most appealing that even after all these years, the same professors are still working at the college. The school has a home like feel because of the atmosphere the campus offers. I highly recommend the University of Maine at Machias if you enjoy the outdoors, especially oceans. There may not be a lot of things to do in town because it is very rural. However, there is an abundance of outdoor activities that will be a once in a lifetime experience. Whether it exploring Jaspers Beach or The Bluff.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2017-05-23T16:50:39.013145Z","guid":"8d43d158-749c-432f-bdc9-f41d702f4fe8","rating":4},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":2.33}],"photos":{"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-67.456534,44.709895,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-67.456534,44.709895,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.2211538461538463,"count":104},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Machias, ME"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/university-of-maine-at-machias/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"26af2a28-12fc-4533-b7b5-b788e1765913","content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"University of the Southwest","type":"College","url":"university-of-the-southwest"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.6578},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":18063},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"742-970"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Alum","body":"I completed an online Master's degree in School Counseling with the U of Southwest.

My classes are really interactive and offer flexibility in your learning style.  I would definitely choose my school if i could do it all over again, the only thing i would change would the orientation offered at the school was somewhat difficult for me. Because my school is outdoor based and environmentally conscious, out orientation is a three week backpacking trip that I wasn't nearly prepared for.
