Public Safety constantly picks up any fallen tree branches, shovels snow, and checks buildings to keep the campus safe. Annville is a small quiet town and the elderly are not afraid to call the police if the parties get too rowdy.  The campus food is not the best, but there is always a salad bar and deli. Turkey Hill also supplies the ice cream.

As a young African American Woman, I was further impressed by not only the diversity of the university's  faculty but also their students. Overall, my experience at CCSU was positive.

The buildings look great and the mostly glass designs give off an open, chic vibe. Webb University Center, or the Webb as we call it, has 5+ eateries, a video game lobby, pool tables, and it is home to many student activities. Unlike other schools, Old Dominion allows their freshman to enjoy their college experience. We have only 1-2 visitation rules, residents don't have a curfew, and dorms are co-ed. With all this freedom, the university still makes sure our work gets done. We are given free tutoring, study rooms on every floor of every dorm, and many educational centers. To relax from the stress of school, you could party near or on campus! Safe Ride (ODU's free transportation.) will take you anywhere that isn't beyond 38th street, which most parties aren't.

There are some rough professors that don’t teach very well but they are outnumbered by ones that you will have an easier time learning from. The campus has many organizations you can join, you will not get bored here. Also, the president and his wife are very involved in student life and never hesitates to carry a conversation! Highly recommend this school.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2018-01-25T03:48:21.754921Z","guid":"7c644fa4-03fd-47e7-9e57-b3db921e96fd","rating":5},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":3}],"photos":{"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-98.22008,32.215665,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-98.22008,32.215665,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.7155555555555555,"count":1575},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Stephenville, TX"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/tarleton-state-university/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"7dc03130-954f-43ac-a9e4-1b613ef63ebe","content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"Bloomsburg University of Pennsylvania","type":"College","url":"bloomsburg-university-of-pennsylvania"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.7756},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":16027},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"870-1070"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Sophomore","body":"Bloomsburg University of Pennsylvania is a great school. Since the University is small, it is easy to create relationships with your professors and other students. There are a lot of different clubs and activities catered to an individual's personal interest. The community assistants in the dorms and the apartments are also great! They are there to help you in any way possible and truly care about their residents and their safety. The education received at Bloomsburg University is amazing! It is also a lot cheaper than a private school where you are receiving the same information. I would encourage everyone to apply to Bloomsburg University of Pennsylvania","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2018-04-01T17:52:25.113543Z","guid":"4e96eb3d-a377-439b-a902-6bd1f02cd12f","rating":5},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":3}],"photos":{"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-76.446383,41.007989,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-76.446383,41.007989,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.6014206787687453,"count":1267},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Bloomsburg, PA"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/bloomsburg-university-of-pennsylvania/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"e86b1196-1af9-41c3-b6c4-095f12ea1f0a","content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"Eastern Michigan University","type":"College","url":"eastern-michigan-university"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.7288},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":14268},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"910-1140"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Junior","body":"I love this school.  It tends to have a bad reputation, especially from where I come from, but I have nothing but great things to say about it.  Campus culture is very work oriented, many people here are ready to really earn their way to what they want to do.  Eastern is very community based, and that is shown in Ypsilanti, and the kind people around you.  Very diverse student body.  EMU tends to be too focused on the work at times, which is never a bad thing, but we could learn to relax.  You have to work to get the experience that you want.  Don't expect to pay tuition and love it - get involved, talk to your professors, do community service, look into study abroad, talk to your classmates, do research!  There is plenty there if you grab it.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2018-05-25T19:01:31.291123Z","guid":"5e5fed39-5d34-462e-9cae-0ed359833037","rating":5},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":2.66}],"photos":{"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-83.624499,42.245751,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-83.624499,42.245751,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.4503844745514463,"count":2731},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Ypsilanti, MI"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/eastern-michigan-university/#scatterplot"}}]}
