There is a real sense of community; the history and quirkiness of the school only add to the charm. While the faculty and staff are incredibly caring and attentive. There are also a ton of opportunities on and off campus. Roanoke is a great location in the heart of the Blue Ridge Mountains which provides endless hiking trails and outdoor areas to explore, and downtown is just a quick drive from campus as well, there really is something for everyone.  The number of clubs, organizations, and activities on campus is incredible considering the schools size.  Academically the student to teacher ratio is awesome, I love knowing all my Professors personally and having them know me. Professors really seem to care about your thoughts and want you to be involved in class.

But on the real— campus is absolutely beautiful, especially to a girl from flat Texas like me! Fayetteville is utterly charming, and has something for everyone. With thousands of international students and its central location, the diversity is special and so treasured on this campus. I am never worried about making friends of different backgrounds, or finding my niche with those who share my cultural background because it happens so naturally. There are also plenty of religious groups to get plugged into on and around campus. My only complaint is the Hill, but it is worth it to live in Pomfret Hall with bigger bathrooms, a nice common area, and the dining hall which comes in handy on days of inclement weather. I truly love being a Razorback, and am so grateful to call Northwest Arkansas my second home.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2017-12-31T08:20:55.505021Z","guid":"743e04d5-da12-4e79-b8a9-e1fbbec69371","rating":5},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":4}],"photos":{"default":{"author":"mtnorton","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/5469a0f272cd5651b2fcfac357f368e9aedfee1b.jpg","MobileHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/c40b369d23ffb3ef5ca2388827b771cfcb22ef59.jpg","Thumbnail":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/a2ba338f9c416b38ba6a2ee45506047d4f0176e7"},"licenseName":"CC BY ","licenseUrl":"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/2.0/","sourceUrl":"https://www.flickr.com/photos/mtnorton/7212584262/"},"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-94.178214,36.06153,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-94.178214,36.06153,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.787639710716634,"count":3042},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Fayetteville, AR"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/university-of-arkansas/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"64d8b1e0-b8cb-4358-8880-643050a09d66","badge":{"display":"Best Colleges for Environmental Science in America","ordinal":158,"total":382,"vanityURL":"best-colleges-for-environmental-science"},"content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"Western Washington University","type":"College","url":"western-washington-university"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.8312},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":16245},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"990-1220"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Freshman","body":"Western Washington University has a great community established in the university as well as surrounding the university.

The amount of clubs and organizations that are on campus allows everyone to be involved in something they are passionate about!","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2018-05-26T00:31:58.928026Z","guid":"7ffc8c25-7ee4-4807-bf19-050d2464d348","rating":5},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":3.66}],"photos":{"default":{"author":"adamprocter","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/26ec2facde69a26dd7f03c83202d6c9036c17c11.jpg","MobileHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/f6d6393c5bd8e0713fd3045561ebce1191395c7d.jpg","Thumbnail":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/291e7fb965c279eb2e6dc3ffee4a632770874dbc"},"licenseName":"CC BY ","licenseUrl":"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/2.0/","sourceUrl":"https://www.flickr.com/photos/adamprocter/537921148/"},"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-92.326429,38.941015,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-92.326429,38.941015,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.6707275803722506,"count":2955},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Columbia, MO"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/university-of-missouri/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"7f446129-261e-4b1c-bc59-64e6c9572962","badge":{"display":"Best Colleges for Environmental Science in America","ordinal":164,"total":382,"vanityURL":"best-colleges-for-environmental-science"},"content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"University of Minnesota - Crookston","type":"College","url":"university-of-minnesota---crookston"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.6817},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":13396},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"800-1100"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Freshman","body":"Nice quiet campus out of the way, good solid classes, workable work load but challenging, very hands on, big on critical thinking.

SLU is an extremely open college where you will meet people from diverse backgrounds who have different experiences. Of course, people will always complain and say that the \"rich white people\" surround SLU. However, if you actually try and engage in the SLU community you will find more than just that. SLU has given me life long friends and an education that I am proud of. So far my classes have gone well and are usually well taught. If there are any complaints, there are always surveys at the end of the semester that go straight to the department heads for review. Finding the right college for you is difficult. I was lucky enough to fall in love with SLU as soon as I visited. I definitely suggest visiting and doing an overnight to see if SLU is right for you.

The amount of scholarship offered to out-of-state students is amazing and helps combat the high cost.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2018-04-10T19:02:12.236272Z","guid":"040f2331-f244-42bf-9627-e453172c9bff","rating":5},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":4}],"photos":{"default":{"crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/72d468d49a692298481d0fd444598807a8e348ce.jpg","MobileHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/e8b3f3c3a38131d336c2949319f659484199b5ba.jpg"},"licenseName":"UNLICENSED"},"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-87.545766,33.2144,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-87.545766,33.2144,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.8969047038752134,"count":4103},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Tuscaloosa, AL"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/the-university-of-alabama/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"f6ebcd8a-6bf5-4c9a-bd92-bc675ff35532","badge":{"display":"Best Colleges for Environmental Science in America","ordinal":180,"total":382,"vanityURL":"best-colleges-for-environmental-science"},"content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"University of California - Irvine","type":"College","url":"university-of-california---irvine"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.4065},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":13780},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"1060-1330"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Sophomore","body":"UCI is a nice place in the sense that it's generally safe and easy to get around. Professors vary from each other; since the university is a research university (and they take pride over that), your professors will vary from individual to individual. It's not surprising if your professor is super smart but horrible in teaching. You really have to fight for yourself here in studying, but that's not saying there aren't good Professors at all - there are! Emphasis on Professors because sometimes that's just what'll make or break your happiness for that quarter or so.\n\nThat being said, it's also not surprising to question your tuition here if it's worth it or not. UCI is a great place for connections, and if you learn well here and you connect well, then the money you put in here is pretty worth.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2018-02-13T03:59:18.054987Z","guid":"6eb5aef0-08a6-40f7-b76f-fef9e86e3c86","rating":4},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":4}],"photos":{"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-117.841248,33.648434,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-117.841248,33.648434,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.634504608294931,"count":3472},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Irvine, CA"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/university-of-california---irvine/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"16e73fef-82a8-4fe4-ae06-3f1392e31d63","badge":{"display":"Best Colleges for Environmental Science in America","ordinal":181,"total":382,"vanityURL":"best-colleges-for-environmental-science"},"content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":true,"isPremium":true,"name":"Binghamton University, SUNY","type":"College","url":"binghamton-university-suny"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.4062},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":16540},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"1230-1400"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Junior","body":"I really like Binghamton but there is room for improvement. As a psychology major it is hard to get into classes you need as they close out, even if you came in with a ton of AP credits. Also, so many classes are big so its harder to focus and do well in them. The campus is hilly. Academics are great, i’ve only had one bad teacher. Advising sucks I had to figure everything out on my own. Mountainview dorms were awfull, invisible RA, no community events, unfriendly people etc. Now I live in Newing and I love it and it’s so much better! Many Long Island students, intentational students (mostly from Asia) and Jewish students. You have to find your people at this school but once you do your experience can be great. Also, we don’t have certain majors like education (also communications, and others people complain about) which really sucks but they try to sell you on their grad program. The food is hit or miss, definitely go to the Kosher station since they have the best food.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2018-05-23T01:30:53.174035Z","guid":"98f168b2-72e9-48d0-bb5e-1cc0fdef30f8","rating":4},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":3.66}],"photos":{"default":{"crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/843cc93be5f59a4bf97adb882d92fccaf932660b.jpg","MobileHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/e1bba7684cb59ca91b80ae5381f80c29566dec0c.jpg"},"licenseName":"UNLICENSED"},"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-75.971143,42.088049,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-75.971143,42.088049,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.5464154411764706,"count":2176},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Vestal, NY"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/binghamton-university-suny/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"600dc8dc-eda3-4c9a-9226-e788eba4be46","badge":{"display":"Best Colleges for Environmental Science in America","ordinal":182,"total":382,"vanityURL":"best-colleges-for-environmental-science"},"content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"SUNY Maritime College","type":"College","url":"suny-maritime-college"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.5804},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":16301},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"1030-1210"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Freshman","body":"The college is an excellent place, I love every second on this campus, yes sometimes the work load can be a lot but there is very good tutoring on campus. Also the regiment program is definitely something I recommend for all who are looking into the school. It keeps you in line where as other schools you don't have that type of guidance where someone is always helping you. Another thing I like is that the regiment is very student based so they understand the struggles of the regiment program as well as the work load of the school. The school has amazing job placement coming out of this school; coming from someone who has family history from the school I can definitely back up my statement.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2018-01-25T21:51:31.729035Z","guid":"c18f5ca1-f0e4-41d1-9cee-175a7656a0ab","rating":5},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":3}],"photos":{"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-73.800336,40.809048,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-73.800336,40.809048,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.3125,"count":112},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Throggs Neck, NY"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/suny-maritime-college/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"450e54ff-bab1-4a3f-a06f-5dd161ad0d0a","badge":{"display":"Best Colleges for Environmental Science in America","ordinal":183,"total":382,"vanityURL":"best-colleges-for-environmental-science"},"content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":true,"isPremium":false,"name":"Goshen College","type":"College","url":"goshen-college"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.6245},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":17398},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"870-1196"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Senior","body":"As a music major, Goshen College has phenomenal facilities!
