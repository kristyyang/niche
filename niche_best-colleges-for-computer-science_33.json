The campus lacks a bit in parties because of public safety cracking down on townhouse and fraternity parties and there isn't much to do in town otherwise. Even with the party crackdown, campus security still lacks cameras over most of campus and things regularly get stolen. Diversity pretty much only exists in that the sports tems try and recruit diverse teams. The school itself lacks diversity but not for any reason specifically. Its a small, expensive school on a mostly white, very conservative town so diversity obviously is lacking.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2018-06-06T13:28:51.604192Z","guid":"25218f04-c836-47fc-be7d-04a38ca3bc27","rating":4},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":3}],"photos":{"default":{"crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/e243774b7af562fe24277ff50c387db5fbeda36a.jpg","MobileHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/00c180c03da80a976c4c7f4e274442f13d75f842.jpg"},"licenseName":"UNLICENSED"},"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-80.331376,41.118456,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-80.331376,41.118456,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.5279805352798053,"count":411},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"New Wilmington, PA"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/westminster-college---pennsylvania/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"10b3c5c0-e1a3-4d2b-8f61-6aa9a3d4eb9c","content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"Malone University","type":"College","url":"malone-university"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.7281},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":20785},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"830-1060"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Sophomore","body":"I decided to attend Malone all the way from Southern California and, while a crazy decision, I would not have chosen any other school.

They also strongly support athletics and  other extra curricular activities. My favorite part of William Penn University is the relationships built while on campus. Due to its small size, you have the ability to know most of the other students that attend the university as well. The small class sizes allow for you to get to know your professor and your professor to get to know you! These relationships are very helpful for classes, internships, and future job opportunities.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2017-02-17T19:34:33.367073Z","guid":"1753e5b2-a613-476b-ba1a-5c133efb038b","rating":4},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":2.33}],"photos":{"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-92.648348,41.308868,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-92.648348,41.308868,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.493243243243243,"count":148},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Oskaloosa, IA"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/william-penn-university/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"46e1550f-969c-4ae7-99c3-79a100677a9b","content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"Bluefield State College","type":"College","url":"bluefield-state-college"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.8331},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":8560},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"870-1070"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Junior","body":"Bluefield State College offers many diverse classes, exceptional instructors, and a an opportunity to achieve your dreams!

Many classes are discussion-based, making them very engaging. Campus is small & it only takes about 5 minutes to walk to class from most dorms. Lexington is a wonderful place to be, although pretty unsafe, which leads me to say that the safety on campus could improve, but that will likely happen soon as a result of an attack that occurred earlier this year. Dining locations on campus currently have unusual hours & sometimes students find that they want food when dining locations are closed, but Lexington as a whole has several nearby restaurants students can order from with their own money. Also, many cheaper housing options were closed down for next year so students will live in the brand-new dorms, which makes it harder for students to find affordable housing. Overall, though, I'd recommend this university to anyone who wants to go to a smaller school and/or live in a bigger city, and especially to artists because Lexington is a very artistic city.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2017-07-27T01:57:05.316293Z","guid":"4c908b63-69b0-4011-af13-ff14c0f24b5f","rating":5},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":3.33}],"photos":{"default":{"crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/8f36cce8c68337eb4666ce7eb7df61d7c92fc0bc.jpg","MobileHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/60571fb9bf154b85b95af6b752884503de2a182d.jpg"},"licenseName":"UNLICENSED"},"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-84.493883,38.053236,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-84.493883,38.053236,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.7111111111111112,"count":270},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Lexington, KY"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/transylvania-university/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"f91aa1b0-a4c6-4a06-b092-17cde3832db4","content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"Alderson Broaddus College","type":"College","url":"alderson-broaddus-college"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.4138},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":18233},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"870-1030"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Alum","body":"Alderson Broaddus is a small school on the mountain top that makes you feel like you have the world at your hand.
