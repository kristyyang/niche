But on the real— campus is absolutely beautiful, especially to a girl from flat Texas like me! Fayetteville is utterly charming, and has something for everyone. With thousands of international students and its central location, the diversity is special and so treasured on this campus. I am never worried about making friends of different backgrounds, or finding my niche with those who share my cultural background because it happens so naturally. There are also plenty of religious groups to get plugged into on and around campus. My only complaint is the Hill, but it is worth it to live in Pomfret Hall with bigger bathrooms, a nice common area, and the dining hall which comes in handy on days of inclement weather. I truly love being a Razorback, and am so grateful to call Northwest Arkansas my second home.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2017-12-31T08:20:55.505021Z","guid":"743e04d5-da12-4e79-b8a9-e1fbbec69371","rating":5},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":4}],"photos":{"default":{"author":"mtnorton","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/5469a0f272cd5651b2fcfac357f368e9aedfee1b.jpg","MobileHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/c40b369d23ffb3ef5ca2388827b771cfcb22ef59.jpg","Thumbnail":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/a2ba338f9c416b38ba6a2ee45506047d4f0176e7"},"licenseName":"CC BY ","licenseUrl":"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/2.0/","sourceUrl":"https://www.flickr.com/photos/mtnorton/7212584262/"},"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-94.178214,36.06153,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-94.178214,36.06153,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.787639710716634,"count":3042},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Fayetteville, AR"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/university-of-arkansas/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"366832a5-05dd-47e7-9434-91ad1d86f859","badge":{"display":"Best Colleges in America","ordinal":257,"total":1644,"vanityURL":"best-colleges"},"content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"University of Kentucky","type":"College","url":"university-of-kentucky"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.9079},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":17850},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"1000-1250"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Sophomore","body":"The University of Kentucky is one of the best universities I've ever been to!

There are numerous tutoring services and most professors are flexible with their office hours to find a time that works for the student.  Almost everyday there's a different activity happening on campus, from goat yoga and Pinterest parties for stress relief, to live music and food to spend time with friends, to tailgates before sports games to support our Wildcats with the most spirit.

The Philosophy department is one of the best in the country and the German department is fairly small but offers a variety of courses. I was also fortunate enough to study abroad in Germany through Rutgers. There are  scholarship opportunities to offset expenses, and my experience was incredible! The bus system used to transport students from one campus to another is unfortunately sub-par. The drivers take frequent and long breaks, which inconveniences students trying to get to class. A majority of buses themselves don't seem to be well maintained, either, and the bus schedule is unreliable. The quality and variety of the dining hall food is OK, depending on which you go to. There is a lot of cultural and racial diversity on campus, and many different types of course studies, clubs, events, etc. to choose from. Over all, Rutgers is a pretty good school, but one should always be prepared for annoyances.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2018-05-30T18:21:16.015754Z","guid":"01a39b76-f2d9-4942-99de-dbfff1bfa771","rating":4},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":4}],"photos":{"default":{"crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/63edd28c8b5adced9098fd93cc2044f1a1013b1e.jpg","MobileHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/ac486ae5a7a7c83d89cc83347b9440903d55d122.jpg","Thumbnail":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/ab0e0070a7e3c8308c08484d2c5a901dd37b097f"},"licenseName":"UNLICENSED"},"mapbox_header":{"crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-74.45051,40.503796,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-74.45051,40.503796,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"UNLICENSED"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.5708023632551935,"count":5247},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Piscataway, NJ"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/rutgers-university--new-brunswick/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"c2731dfa-36e9-438a-b5a1-5b5a783f9140","badge":{"display":"Best Colleges in America","ordinal":166,"total":1644,"vanityURL":"best-colleges"},"content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"University of Nebraska - Lincoln","type":"College","url":"university-of-nebraska---lincoln"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.7527},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":16462},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"990-1280"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Alum","body":"Attending UNL was a wonderful experience!

It is very diverse with people from all around the world. The professors are very helpful and there is a common theme of \"the mission to education\" where every person is working with another to improve the educational experience for everyone. \nAlthough having large classes might be an advantage for some people, it minimizes the interaction between the students, which could be improved. Students don't interact very well in classes and rely on extracurricular activities or living on campus to get to know more people. Additionally, another area where the university can improve is the campus food! The dining halls don't present a variety of options, which makes it hard for some people to find what is right for them.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2018-02-13T23:38:36.65625Z","guid":"3eae44c9-11d7-4bd7-b6bb-a66916179cb7","rating":4},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":3.66}],"photos":{"default":{"author":"c-chen","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/1ffc5e24c53bf90b27f3233f41b9d3f8022122a6.jpg","MobileHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/1b1628fbaa3b25606429ec6955db55878bb4808e.jpg","Thumbnail":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/9c7e717a597fd715d684dca9de7a19daa3341afa"},"licenseName":"CC BY-SA","licenseUrl":"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/","sourceUrl":"https://www.flickr.com/photos/c-chen/6266767392/"},"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-72.249519,41.808205,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-72.249519,41.808205,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.5493150684931507,"count":2920},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Storrs, CT"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/university-of-connecticut/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"d9c8ac5f-72f9-45e2-9ddb-88bc3655a2f6","badge":{"display":"Best Colleges in America","ordinal":309,"total":1644,"vanityURL":"best-colleges"},"content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"College of the Ozarks","type":"College","url":"college-of-the-ozarks"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.1422},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":13308},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"1025-1159"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Sophomore","body":"College of the Ozarks provides education with free tuition.

A huge disappointment, since a lot of universities do offer such programs.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2017-08-10T03:48:37.714462Z","guid":"88fe80ef-13e4-4c72-80a0-6dacddcad432","rating":4},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":3}],"photos":{"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-117.819019,34.054273,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-117.819019,34.054273,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.547645125958379,"count":2739},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Pomona, CA"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/california-state-polytechnic-university---pomona/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"62a9aa87-cfba-4885-b774-ef2a958e5cd8","badge":{"display":"Best Colleges in America","ordinal":562,"total":1644,"vanityURL":"best-colleges"},"content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"Missouri State University","type":"College","url":"missouri-state-university"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.8438},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":14862},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"955-1228"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Junior","body":"Missouri State University provides a plethora of opportunities to its students including recreational, pre-professional, and social activities.

I joined a sorority my first year and through that I have gained friends who encouraged me to get involved on campus in areas that I'm interested in and in organizations that they thought I would like. Because of the wonderful people at LaTech, I've been a member of leadership team at my church, the Student Government Association, Bulldogs for Life, AED PreMed Society, and many honor societies. The friends I've made here see the potential in me and push me to apply for leadership positions on campus. I'm pre-med and as I've gotten older, I've grown close to other students in my major and they are a HUGE support system for me because we share notes, advice, and prepare for things like interviews together. I can't think of much that I would change. I would like for the Pre-Med/Pre-Dent Advisory Committee interviews to be offered in the fall quarter instead of just once a year in the spring quarter.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2018-03-09T02:06:08.705378Z","guid":"8602bb74-934b-4133-9934-2dada4efdc51","rating":5},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":3.66}],"photos":{"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-92.64964,32.525518,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-92.64964,32.525518,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.6758241758241756,"count":910},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Ruston, LA"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/louisiana-tech-university/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"a76d318b-acc7-4dc6-8ef7-e55f2db86e52","badge":{"display":"Best Colleges in America","ordinal":745,"total":1644,"vanityURL":"best-colleges"},"content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"Rocky Mountain College","type":"College","url":"rocky-mountain-college"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.6207},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":19412},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"878-1106"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Alum","body":"I loved how small Rocky was- -I made excellent connections with my teachers, which opened up a ton of opportunities for me!
