Not as corny as it sounds.  You know people in major/outside.  News flow isn't always the best. If you bond with teachers and professors easily, you will always have the upper hand.  Professors care and work with you.  Many repeatedly encourage students to visit offices.  Very open. Running trail by cornfields,  wetlands to explore, two lakes, a cemetery, woods, and school is only 2-10 minutes from Walmart/The Mall/etc (Many job opps aside from work study).  Mass held in the basilica on Sunday. Professors are also VERY FRIENDLY monks that live on campus.  Don't feel pressured if not religious, no requirements.\n\nMiscellaneous:\nAthletics huge here.  Will pass several official/intramural teams daily.\nTuition reduced a lot.  Listed price is falsely high.\nSafe.  Quiet/calm weekends.\nHousing OKAY.  Really depends.\nGood food.  Can be repetitive though.  Many vegetarian options.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2017-04-22T12:23:20.697812Z","guid":"57431fe0-f590-4b92-917e-a965fa7669ba","rating":4},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":3}],"photos":{"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-79.403702,40.29252,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-79.403702,40.29252,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.4795081967213113,"count":488},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Latrobe, PA"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/saint-vincent-college---pennsylvania/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"124e6a5b-2560-45a1-882d-504fe59d21ae","content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"University of Colorado - Colorado Springs","type":"College","url":"university-of-colorado---colorado-springs"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.9286},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":15248},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"940-1190"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Freshman","body":"The University of Colorado-Colorado Springs is a great school to attend.

It is absolutely amazing the construction and improvements they have made to their facilities. Over the last several years with tuitions going way up for private schools, many are opting for top notch State schools. Brockport has become one of the best and hardest academic SUNY schools to get into in NY, recently. Many ratings have Brockport as a top 20 or even top 10 SUNY school in NY and their academic standards have passed every other school in the SUNY system besides Geneseo. I have also seen rankings country wide with Brockport now being rated around the 50-75 range of best schools. Highly recommend to anyone interested in attending a SUNY school in NY!","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2017-09-27T14:11:38.127297Z","guid":"00750c89-32db-49b5-8e2f-e5567883c4ba","rating":5},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":3}],"photos":{"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-77.949824,43.209862,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-77.949824,43.209862,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.4708063021316033,"count":1079},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Brockport, NY"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/suny-college-at-brockport/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"d5a14210-803f-44b9-ab06-c44af93e8b60","content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":true,"isPremium":false,"name":"University of St. Francis - Illinois","type":"College","url":"university-of-st-francis---illinois"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.4923},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":17968},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"910-1110"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Sophomore","body":"I absolutely love all the faculty and students!

The campus is a very inviting environment; there are always events going on whether it is sports, diversity, or arts. The professors give off a warm, caring  aroma. No student should be afraid to ask for help from their professor; they are always willing whether it is through office hours or email. MSUM offers many ways to help students succeed; from tutoring to the Wellness Center for physical health. The campus is just the right size, not too small yet not overwhelming as well. As soon as I visited MSUM my senior year of high school, I knew it was home. Though, what I would like to see change is the exclusion from some activities held on campus. For example, they have activities that exclude some students from clubs or learning communities. I wish for more equality in allowing all students to be involved. Otherwise, I believe MSUM is a great place full of opportunities for students to further their education.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2017-11-26T05:07:52.397844Z","guid":"0ece1c33-a37d-4bed-abe0-cadcfc074cbc","rating":4},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":3}],"photos":{"default":{"crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/db9b3a0ff27f272424f505083bf388c9377f84cd.jpg","MobileHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/9579f183666104e0e7185a4591a4b5f6878c5147.jpg"},"licenseName":"UNLICENSED"},"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-96.763376,46.866482,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-96.763376,46.866482,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.4360795454545454,"count":704},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Moorhead, MN"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/minnesota-state-university-moorhead/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"96157503-b967-490a-ad5e-c0d0d18b2dc1","content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":true,"isPremium":false,"name":"University of Nebraska at Kearney","type":"College","url":"university-of-nebraska-at-kearney"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.8508},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":15520},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"830-1020"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Freshman","body":"My experience at the University of Nebraska at Kearney has been very good.

One thing I do wish was different would be the amount of students that are accepted. With so many students here, it's very difficult to get into the classes necessary to graduate. There are a lot of impacted majors, but that is because the programs Sac State offers have to be some of the best in the country; so, it's understandable.

Be sure to check the requirements for coming back to the university to make sure you understand what you are looking at for classes and graduation requirements.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2017-12-28T13:38:54.867948Z","guid":"806d6b5a-f537-4c77-be2c-168159e4fbee","rating":4},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":3}],"photos":{"default":{"crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/1343180484ab4c99e551ce91dc92702d03601db0.jpg","MobileHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/c95f6528c2c63b86ccc87d4a4c366049b4e94b5c.jpg"},"licenseName":"UNLICENSED"},"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-72.218753,41.721673,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-72.218753,41.721673,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.306122448979592,"count":980},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Willimantic, CT"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/eastern-connecticut-state-university/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"c0d912d3-8814-47fe-9be4-af999dd0affb","content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"SUNY Oswego","type":"College","url":"suny-oswego"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.5452},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":16381},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"1010-1180"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Sophomore","body":"SUNY Oswego has many opportunities and is full of amazing people.
