They were all pretty friendly and helpful. All but the computer professor (of course) have a strong objection to electronics in the classroom, though, which I thought was a bit odd. I understand prohibiting cell phones in class. I do not understand prohibiting tablets or laptops, even if you're using them to take notes. Luckily I have accommodations to take notes electronically--otherwise, I'd be up a certain creek without a paddle. Most high schools use iPads or some other tablet/laptop now, in the classroom, so students coming in are obviously used to that; why prohibit it now? Anyway, the courses I took were great. Their quality was more or less impeccable. Class sizes are GREAT--usually 20-30. As to variety...their catalog says that French and German classes are available, but they're actually not, because they don't have anyone to teach them; as a result, the only available foreign language course is Spanish. I am tired of Spanish being the only language both offered and/or required in all schools, not just college. It's time to break out into other linguistic areas!","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2015-12-29T17:25:23Z","guid":"c3f4f03d-933f-41be-848b-589b4fb4ae81","rating":5},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":2.66}],"photos":{"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-81.970898,34.954585,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-81.970898,34.954585,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.5481927710843375,"count":166},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"2 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Spartanburg, SC"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/spartanburg-methodist-college/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"9a59f82f-2bd2-456f-8826-09b3a98f36e9","content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"Lincoln College","type":"College","url":"lincoln-college"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.6202},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":16123},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"610-810"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Sophomore","body":"I am a returning student enrolled in Lincoln College & my experience there has been great.The professors there are phenomenal they are willing to give you one on one help, well organized,& are always reasonable with students and other professors. There is a tutoring center where commuters & full time students can go to get extra help with an assignment, writing a paper,or to just to ask questions. Living on campus teaches you how to be a responsible young adult you have the chance to learn from mistakes & make your own decisions.Lincoln being a private, independent liberal arts college still have provided students with all type of activities and sports that you can get involved in.We have a variety of foods that is serves for breakfast, lunch & dinner. I know the hardest part about college for most students is paying for it. Our financial aid office provides students with useful information.

The professors on average have 15 plus years experience in their respective fields, guaranteeing that I am learning the most up to date information in my area of study.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2017-02-17T17:29:03.360646Z","guid":"27d19c86-e1cd-4c7d-94f8-952bbd076410","rating":4},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":2}],"photos":{"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-71.142082,42.331032,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-71.142082,42.331032,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.58974358974359,"count":234},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Brookline, MA"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/newbury-college/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"6071b1d5-7f9f-4560-80c1-377d18761488","content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"Louisburg College","type":"College","url":"louisburg-college"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.7482},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":17351},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"700-930"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Freshman","body":"I attended Louisburg College for the 2016-2017 academic year under the transfer program.

The classrooms have an average size of fifteen people, the perfect amount of students for an easy learning environment. Students at colleges with two hundred plus students a class most likely have a hard time getting to their professors knowing all the other two hundred students are as well, but at Salkehatchie, with the perfect sized classes, professors are easy to access and easy to get to talk with in and out of class.

Loyalty to Southwestern and to the Builder Family.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2017-12-04T23:07:53.983009Z","guid":"3c433a1d-85fd-40ea-8d9b-711f1ce76b76","rating":5},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":2.66}],"photos":{"default":{"crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/eeefa3d50c2c530ae6b7b79fb0d468bf46f93c11.jpg","MobileHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/08de81c1cc08af34c539f93948ad7839a32631fe.jpg"},"licenseName":"UNLICENSED"},"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-96.9783,37.2493,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-96.9783,37.2493,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.6354166666666665,"count":96},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Winfield, KS"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/southwestern-college---kansas/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"1c163dff-481e-4333-8cff-08e7992e4952","content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"Wilberforce University","type":"College","url":"wilberforce-university"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.3841},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":17678},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"710-960"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Senior","body":"Wilberforce University has made me more hungry, and competitive than ever before!

I am a first generation college student, which means that I am the first in my family to attend college. I was a lost freshman who stumbled into OSP (Opportunity Scholars Program) there on the USC Sumter campus, and was instantly welcomed with open arms. The staff is outstanding, the best I have seen. They guided me through my entire first two years on the campus. I highly reccommend joining the program. They offer free use of the computer labs, printing, acedemic advising, peer coaches and even TUTORING. The other faculty and staff on campus are completely welcoming and the whole campus is like a big family. The campus is small, but I do not regret my years at USC Sumter one bit!","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2017-06-11T23:42:29.925097Z","guid":"4abe47fb-292a-41de-8a65-05815dcf6fc0","rating":5},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":3.33}],"photos":{"default":{"crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/d9fc567edee65e8261400d75f336d195b0fa94bd.jpg","MobileHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/b3ecf4d50d04703340bd7894d1947dc27d82a473.jpg"},"licenseName":"UNLICENSED"},"mapbox_header":{"crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-80.377,33.9363,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-80.377,33.9363,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"UNLICENSED"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.9565217391304346,"count":46},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"2 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Sumter, SC"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/university-of-south-carolina---sumter/#scatterplot"}}]}
