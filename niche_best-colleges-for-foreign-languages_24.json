The professors are always available for outside of class help, and most of the professors try their best to make a relationship with each student.  The campus is beautiful and constantly undergoing new development and improvement.  Connecting with campus is seamless as each club and program is more than willing to accept new team members to help organize events and bring out the colonel spirit.   The events and programs on campus are almost all student lead  and developed, so all of the events benefit students of all backgrounds and interests.  There is always something to do on the weekends, and if nothing interests you specifically, their is always an opportunity for you to organize an event to reach out to students with the same interest; all with the support of whatever club/organization you choose to go through.  The campus is all about expanding its influence into the community and helping those in need.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2018-01-10T18:31:44.551923Z","guid":"5d5c0d01-e395-40c1-a999-4959f1d4455c","rating":5},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":3}],"photos":{"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-75.88833,41.243204,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-75.88833,41.243204,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.396414342629482,"count":502},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Wilkes-Barre, PA"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/wilkes-university/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"be8a08a5-47c4-422e-be77-ee2111d47e2e","badge":{"display":"Best Colleges in America","ordinal":603,"total":1644,"vanityURL":"best-colleges"},"content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"Webster University","type":"College","url":"webster-university"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.4658},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":24717},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"1075-1235"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Sophomore","body":"The professors and staff at Webster University are great!

I wish they would try to improve the parking situation.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2017-11-13T17:41:05.018366Z","guid":"156c3021-d415-4036-ab77-f84eb42216d5","rating":4},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":3}],"photos":{"default":{"crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/f76f37b2c77cbc3d8316f04445c1b74e634818d0.jpg","MobileHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/2fee799f116d7a4b2367eacb9adc16cecd92c6c3.jpg"},"licenseName":"UNLICENSED"},"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-92.105738,46.81544,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-92.105738,46.81544,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.6693548387096775,"count":496},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Duluth, MN"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/the-college-of-st-scholastica/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"e139ba03-9307-4e33-b7da-e76bd64de886","badge":{"display":"Best Colleges in America","ordinal":271,"total":1644,"vanityURL":"best-colleges"},"content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":true,"isPremium":false,"name":"Hobart and William Smith Colleges","type":"College","url":"hobart-and-william-smith-colleges"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.5799},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":38805},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"1190-1320"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Junior","body":"I love this place!

The food needs to be more appealing and more of a variety should be brought to out selection.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2018-06-01T15:26:48.678929Z","guid":"d47f1217-26f8-43ba-b81e-0d3d71484317","rating":4},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":3.33}],"photos":{"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-90.107307,29.964162,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-90.107307,29.964162,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.3153564899451555,"count":1094},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"New Orleans, LA"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/xavier-university-of-louisiana/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"e78ac147-ee54-4c9c-ad4d-f0999d63423d","badge":{"display":"Best Colleges in America","ordinal":641,"total":1644,"vanityURL":"best-colleges"},"content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"Dominican University","type":"College","url":"dominican-university"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.6373},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":18219},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"910-1200"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Alum","body":"Dominican University is an incredible institution that allows for each student to have a uniquely intimate and personal academic experience.

My professors first semester were all so helpful and invested in truly helping their students succeed. Their office hours were always super open to students, and they were some of the friendliest people I have met. Although the school is originally very expensive, they offer many scholarships and loans through financial aid that make attending the university infinitely more affordable. Classes were neither too  easy nor too difficult. They were just enough work to challenge me, but not overwhelm me. If I had any complaints about Hamline, they would fall into the residential life category. My dorm is very old and in need of some renovation. The toilets and showers are always broken, and the elevator does not always work. The size of my room is perfect, though. Unfortunately I will not be living on campus next year due to the old living facilities, though.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2018-01-23T19:14:32.5679Z","guid":"eed8b157-d70e-467c-bcf8-28010360c261","rating":4},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":3}],"photos":{"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-93.163983,44.965696,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-93.163983,44.965696,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.426892950391645,"count":766},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Saint Paul, MN"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/hamline-university/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"b6a67ea2-900c-4e19-9801-a053c85a3251","badge":{"display":"Best Colleges in America","ordinal":176,"total":1644,"vanityURL":"best-colleges"},"content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"Ohio Northern University","type":"College","url":"ohio-northern-university"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.6411},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":24348},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"1030-1235"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Freshman","body":"Ohio Northern is a very prestiguous school full of opportunity.

I would definitely consider looking at Franciscan if you are looking for a well rounded education and for something that will push you to become a better person.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2018-02-18T22:42:01.873589Z","guid":"c78f70db-f4c1-4478-a85d-217aea2771dd","rating":5},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":3}],"photos":{"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-80.623094,40.376086,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-80.623094,40.376086,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.5127175368139225,"count":747},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Steubenville, OH"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/franciscan-university-of-steubenville/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"cad1079a-12ea-411f-a342-4e8ef5d1a51d","content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":true,"isPremium":true,"name":"University of Northwestern - St. Paul","type":"College","url":"university-of-northwestern---st-paul"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.8692},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":23814},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"960-1230"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Alum","body":"My time at UNWSP was nothing short of exceptional. I grew from a crazy, rebellious high school \"boy\" into a still-crazy and fun-loving man with a passion for Jesus Christ, family, church, community, and living life as an example of what His love looks like in the world.\nThe friends and relationships I made have been some of the richest of my life. The professors really care about the students in their classes, and even the support staff is there with the heart to serve the Lord through their work around campus. \nI had a professor explain in detail that if making money is your only goal, college is not for you. (Live with your parents for 4 years rent free. Work at minimum wage and save it all without tuition. Retire a millionaire.) HOWEVER - if your goal of higher education is to grow as a person, and follower of the Lord, while also getting a degree that rocks and an education that is of outstanding caliber, then the University of Northwestern - St. Paul is for you!","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2017-08-22T15:11:42.273446Z","guid":"c4f1e8dc-fc0f-4f5e-8479-1dc3bd3ad60e","rating":5},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":2.66}],"photos":{"default":{"crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/c4d1f8310ff1fa5bc1356185fcd255de1118cd29.jpg","MobileHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/bb157717f27602eee3f7e7a972d5adf78236db3e.jpg"},"licenseName":"UNLICENSED"},"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-93.171579,45.032969,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-93.171579,45.032969,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.752532561505065,"count":691},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Saint Paul, MN"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/university-of-northwestern---st-paul/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"319b5387-5c04-4800-8c43-235676099e04","badge":{"display":"Best Colleges in America","ordinal":132,"total":1644,"vanityURL":"best-colleges"},"content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"College of Wooster","type":"College","url":"college-of-wooster"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.5816},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":29813},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"1070-1350"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Junior","body":"I absolutely love the College of Wooster! When I visited for the first time, I fell in love with the atmosphere of the College. I felt welcomed right away and never lost this feeling. Additionally, I loved that the students seemed to really care about their campus and that most students are extremely involved on campus. This was all clear to me during my tour and then when I sat in on a class, I was sold. The professor I had was engaging and made the rather large classroom (by Wooster's standards) seem much more intimate. I remember hearing students talking about the class and other classes before and after the lecture, which made me realize how engaged in academics students here are. Fast forward four years and here I am typing this review as a junior at the College. I am so happy that I chose the College of Wooster and that every good thought I had about the College has been proven right ten-fold since coming here.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2017-09-28T19:14:11.732478Z","guid":"7151ada7-491c-482a-be1f-89289234009d","rating":5},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":4}],"photos":{"default":{"author":"cogdog","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/c7b22f39c24ab144a0e0d2445bc21b28e7c67cf2.jpg","MobileHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/fecf2c4978a9be0483d19ec59e55c5e28fd10796.jpg","Thumbnail":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/e06a3442f84bca7de61c7a2e58f95766e6633c97"},"licenseName":"CC BY ","licenseUrl":"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/2.0/","sourceUrl":"https://www.flickr.com/photos/cogdog/8763606508/"},"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-81.934674,40.81046,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-81.934674,40.81046,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.536326530612245,"count":1225},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Wooster, OH"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/college-of-wooster/#scatterplot"}}]}
