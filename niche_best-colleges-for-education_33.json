This institution gives many opportunities to all the students regardless if they are freshman or seniors. I had the privilege to be part of the Science Education Alliance-Phage Hunters Advancing Genomics and Evolutionary Science (SEA-PHAGES) program being a freshman. This school offers a wide variety of organizations which focus on the different majors that can be obtained here. These include: psycology, natural sciences,social sciences, humanities, pedadogy, physical education, enterprise administration, among others. Also, most of the professors in this university are \"pro-student\"; which gives the whole professor/student relationship a new meaning. Sincerely, I would choose this school because it offers great education, a great faculty in a lot of departments and excellent opportunities in the graduate life.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2016-08-09T20:40:38Z","guid":"9f08bd1c-a064-4c1c-9643-8dd49ec5fd9c","rating":4},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade"}],"photos":{"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-66.163146,18.117232,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-66.163146,18.117232,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.575221238938053,"count":113},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Cayey, PR"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/university-of-puerto-rico---cayey/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"d1fc6227-52cd-45b0-a74d-1de59ac603a6","content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"Bethel University - Tennessee","type":"College","url":"bethel-university---tennessee"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.6652},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":14583},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"795-1060"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Sophomore","body":"The main thing that I like about Bethel University is that since it is in a small town you get the small town feel which is one that I am used to.

The food here is good, but also could be better.  As far as tuition, I think they should provide more scholarships for students who pay out of pocket.

Although it is a commuter college, there are many ways to get involved in the school such as sports, clubs, and work! Indiana University Northwest is committed to its students and faculty. Students have many opportunities to work with professors and coordinators on large projects that teaches students how to think critically. No professor, coordinator, or advisor will turn a student away if he or she needs help with anything. Everyone there wants the students to succeed and give them a sense of confidence when they leave IUN.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2017-02-10T16:37:50.392465Z","guid":"492b1ade-e449-4255-8c0d-9f1a397860f8","rating":5},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":2.33}],"photos":{"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-87.338457,41.556723,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-87.338457,41.556723,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.1669195751138086,"count":659},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Gary, IN"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/indiana-university---northwest/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"c08bed14-e91b-4ccc-9808-7c92eabb86ac","content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"University of South Florida - St. Petersburg","type":"College","url":"university-of-south-florida---st-petersburg"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.3567},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":11150},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"1050-1240"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Sophomore","body":"I love USFSP! The campus is beautiful, and the waterfront has many activities to keep students busy . There is always something to do, and the community aspect of the school is amazing! Making friends has not been difficult because the activities foster a friendly environment. I have loved all of my professors as well. They are extremely knowledgeable in what they teach, and they make learning engaging and interesting. The smaller size of the school supports building relationships with professors, and the school leadership knows many students by name.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2018-05-28T22:10:15.394446Z","guid":"ab2d70ea-3ff9-4736-b5c6-628868e44798","rating":5},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":3.33}],"photos":{"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-82.635657,27.762618,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-82.635657,27.762618,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.6449438202247193,"count":445},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"St. Petersburg, FL"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/university-of-south-florida---st-petersburg/#scatterplot"}}]}
