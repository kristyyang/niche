I believe with the knowledge I am acquiring and the ability to communicate with diverse audiences, I am inspired and motivated to seek higher education in order to create a better quality of life for me and my family. UMSL has opportunities for developing leadership, networking, mentoring and team concepts that can put you on a path to achieve your educational goal. Current statistics of high school dropout rates and lack of accreditation of schools convinces me there is an opportunity for me to become a part of the solution.  My passion is to help the youth.  I re-entered school to gain tools in communications.  I think I will be equipped and on my way to become an author and a public speaker after completing a degree in communications.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2018-04-24T17:56:15.095979Z","guid":"59ebd44e-f549-4ae2-9e17-58b8ce2f8bf5","rating":4},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":3}],"photos":{"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-90.308886,38.711297,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-90.308886,38.711297,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.44284128745838,"count":901},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Saint Louis, MO"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/university-of-missouri---st-louis/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"eb254daa-a9c0-4696-9989-f4b4c0b80ac4","content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"Millersville University of Pennsylvania","type":"College","url":"millersville-university-of-pennsylvania"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.6948},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":18624},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"930-1130"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Alum","body":"My experience at Millersville University has been phenomenal!

Campus culture is very work oriented, many people here are ready to really earn their way to what they want to do.  Eastern is very community based, and that is shown in Ypsilanti, and the kind people around you.  Very diverse student body.  EMU tends to be too focused on the work at times, which is never a bad thing, but we could learn to relax.  You have to work to get the experience that you want.  Don't expect to pay tuition and love it - get involved, talk to your professors, do community service, look into study abroad, talk to your classmates, do research!  There is plenty there if you grab it.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2018-05-25T19:01:31.291123Z","guid":"5e5fed39-5d34-462e-9cae-0ed359833037","rating":5},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":2.66}],"photos":{"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-83.624499,42.245751,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-83.624499,42.245751,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.4503844745514463,"count":2731},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Ypsilanti, MI"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/eastern-michigan-university/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"7dc03130-954f-43ac-a9e4-1b613ef63ebe","content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"Bloomsburg University of Pennsylvania","type":"College","url":"bloomsburg-university-of-pennsylvania"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.7756},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":16027},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"870-1070"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Sophomore","body":"Bloomsburg University of Pennsylvania is a great school.

Anyone who's satisfied with a basic degree (art, bio, etc) would probably do well here.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2018-05-14T01:09:20.373519Z","guid":"07ba53af-6ad5-40b2-b758-5774d3009232","rating":4},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":3}],"photos":{"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-108.553899,45.796765,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-108.553899,45.796765,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.46,"count":300},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Billings, MT"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/rocky-mountain-college/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"7882fac4-5ed2-4fd6-bc3b-228bf86d7915","content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"Franklin Pierce University","type":"College","url":"franklin-pierce-university"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.8139},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":29136},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"870-1070"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Freshman","body":"The faculty and students are very welcoming and happy!

I live on campus in Dixon Hall and it is extremely nice, the dorms are suite-style and the whole building is secure and airconditioned. My favorite part of the campus has to be the student recreation center. The fitness center is my absolute favorite place to go and it is packed with any machine that you could want.

There are plenty of restaurants, shops, and bars along Philadelphia Street to keep students entertained in the evenings and on the weekends.  Overall, I have received a quality education at IUP, and I would certainly recommend the university to others!","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2017-06-14T00:34:38.38611Z","guid":"216f6226-49ec-497e-86db-e5d5160ea815","rating":5},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":2.66}],"photos":{"default":{"crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/7c0a4013a571b3a4a1264b3cb67be13d334effcc.jpg","MobileHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/dbc91e581f5249282986d93e1f6cabd86c38fca7.jpg"},"licenseName":"UNLICENSED"},"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-79.159869,40.615589,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-79.159869,40.615589,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.479651162790698,"count":2408},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Indiana, PA"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/indiana-university-of-pennsylvania/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"305f34bd-c28b-45a5-8767-25ad1cd6f5dd","content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"Olivet College","type":"College","url":"olivet-college"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.5335},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":20973},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"870-1180"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Sophomore","body":"Olivet College is a very nice school all together. What it distinctly lacks in activities to participate in on campus is made up for in the academic aspects of the college. The teachers are all available and extremely willing to help out the students almost all of the time. With Olivet having such a small student base, most of the teachers have plenty of time to help the students learn or better understand the content of each class. Besides this, the school's food is fairly decent for the most part with some exceptions. However, it has improved greatly in this aspect as this past year has progressed.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2018-05-01T00:33:20.45971Z","guid":"27144c51-b643-49fa-8aeb-5f0f26df8f10","rating":4},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":2}],"photos":{"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-84.922864,42.440908,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-84.922864,42.440908,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.403041825095057,"count":263},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Olivet, MI"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/olivet-college/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"c65e2a91-f153-4d31-9aac-b838a7c2cd07","content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"Valley City State University","type":"College","url":"valley-city-state-university"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.9812},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":12073},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"810-950"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"College Sophomore","body":"My overall experience at Valley City State University has been very good so far.  Quite a few of my family are alumni from Valley City State University and have had great experiences from VCSU.  They talk highly of VCSU and feel that they have received a good education.  I really like the small size and the feeling of a small community where you are a name and not a number.  It is a college where it is affordable and most professors seem to care about you and if you are in class of not.  My favorite experiences are it has been easy to make true friends, be involved, and not feel overwhelmed with the size.  If I would have to choose again I still would stick with VCSU because it is a great school.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2016-02-23T22:32:49Z","guid":"e5110dfc-ca20-49cb-bb39-004546dcf8b7","rating":4},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":3}],"photos":{"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-98.001762,46.919144,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-98.001762,46.919144,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.5161290322580645,"count":93},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Valley City, ND"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/valley-city-state-university/#scatterplot"}}]}
