This institution has world-class professors and equipment in fields such as engineering, astrology, optics, and more. The strong athletic programs at the U fo A also bolster the school spirit and makes it easy to get fired up at sporting events with your schoolmate. As a student, you also have the best opportunity to mingle and network with industry professionals throughout the school year. Companies consistently send representative directly to the school for seminars and job fairs with the sole purpose of finding a college student to potentially employ. Having the chance to land an internship or even get a job offer at the U of A can often be a simple as showing up to a school event! To summarize, the University of Arizona is an amazing opportunity for anyone looking to get a world-class education in an environment where employers often come directly to you.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2018-03-01T03:25:26.123698Z","guid":"092f1096-7bb8-4ba8-852f-05209f1ef07f","rating":4},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":3.66}],"photos":{"default":{"author":"iagoarchangel","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/50d9d513c48381c6ba4939908c60bbd3ac3a4631.jpg","MobileHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/0c9c05adf4b9e9ce85277fdbe92468b57d06a2e7.jpg","Thumbnail":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/375760a6d8ec09f2b2b89cb9f9f2d14e6e577f2e"},"licenseName":"CC BY-SA","licenseUrl":"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/","sourceUrl":"https://www.flickr.com/photos/iagoarchangel/8608390310/"},"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-110.950769,32.232071,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-110.950769,32.232071,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.7181506849315067,"count":5840},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Tucson, AZ"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/university-of-arizona/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"54af20f6-d50b-4251-be8a-67933a38eba0","badge":{"display":"Best Colleges for Criminal Justice in America","ordinal":160,"total":484,"vanityURL":"best-colleges-for-criminal-justice"},"content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"University of Texas - Dallas","type":"College","url":"university-of-texas---dallas"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.6799},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":10254},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"1140-1380"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Alum","body":"UT Dallas has a great return on investment. They place a lot of emphasis on academic growth and career success, and many students are offered generous scholarships during their undergrad. If money is a concern for you, I would strongly consider applying and seeing what scholarships you earn, because that was the deciding factor for me when I was in high school. Social life is lacking a bit but improving overall. It's important to get yourself out there and get involved in organizations, people I know in Greek life have also really enjoyed their experience. UTD is fairly close to Dallas and has a modern-type campus with many new buildings recently built. Campus food is excellent now with many options, there is also a full Starbucks store on campus. \n\nOverall, UTD is actually a great school that focuses on academics but has also improved in many other areas recently. If value is a crucial factor for you, I would strongly recommend going here for college!","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2018-05-19T00:37:56.45339Z","guid":"9102d626-38f1-40bc-8bbd-fd7e34ec1f06","rating":4},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":3.66}],"photos":{"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-96.748371,32.989432,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-96.748371,32.989432,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.624618514750763,"count":1966},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Richardson, TX"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/university-of-texas---dallas/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"119238de-0271-4787-b006-302adc76827c","badge":{"display":"Best Colleges for Criminal Justice in America","ordinal":161,"total":484,"vanityURL":"best-colleges-for-criminal-justice"},"content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"West Chester University of Pennsylvania","type":"College","url":"west-chester-university-of-pennsylvania"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.6448},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":18651},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"970-1150"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Freshman","body":"I love the atmosphere of both West Chester University and the town!

With the small class room sizes, you are able to not develop close relations to your peers, but your professors as well. A professor-student  relationship is crucial not only in the learning process, but even future academic adventures outside of Adrian. The professors are more than willing to sit down with you and break it down, piece by piece. You are not just another nameless face, you are you. Being a liberal arts college, distributions are a requirement. Though they may be an annoyance at first, they become well-rounded student shaping machines. Through these classes, you are able to educate your self of the other perceptions, cultures, and ideas along with the synthesis of your own. Though the social scene is somewhat lacking, Adrian College makes up for it in its application of the Arts and Sciences.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2018-05-02T01:16:08.435687Z","guid":"f0228f49-3de9-4c02-9e74-64b584d68ec4","rating":5},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":2.66}],"photos":{"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-84.059947,41.898449,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-84.059947,41.898449,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.442906574394464,"count":578},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Adrian, MI"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/adrian-college/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"a490b51d-bffc-40f8-bf2b-e934a0d69612","badge":{"display":"Best Colleges for Criminal Justice in America","ordinal":163,"total":484,"vanityURL":"best-colleges-for-criminal-justice"},"content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"Defiance College","type":"College","url":"defiance-college"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.5818},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":24995},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"790-1010"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Senior","body":"My experience at Defiance College has overall been excellent.

A lot of opportunities for internships, leadership positions and involvement. A lot of research opportunities and very good professors as well, especially for a public university. Despite the perception, OU is a lot more than just football and greek life. However, I would recommend that after freshman year, you live somewhere within walking distance to campus, because the parking here is absolutely awful and you will absolutely regret commuting to campus and spending nearly 2 hours looking for a parking spot everyday, even with a parking pass that costs hundreds of dollars. Also Dale Hall is a ridiculous building and if you have a class there, get there early because trying to make your way through the crowds in that building can sometimes take a while. The parking situation & Dale Hall is the only thing preventing me from giving this great school 5 stars.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2017-11-06T00:20:34.290457Z","guid":"75f25a4a-6e57-4df8-b0a2-0b3897295b1c","rating":4},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":4}],"photos":{"default":{"crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/6a7d7e2d5c708a009e6b4857db0d69cf2efb39c4.jpg","MobileHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/eeb1688e862a426894b97137be0e4145307a7a24.jpg","Thumbnail":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/0dfb8859200ebd86bfb0acaf4b7740bcc6822455"},"licenseName":"UNLICENSED"},"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-97.445692,35.208152,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-97.445692,35.208152,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.7810136157337366,"count":2644},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Norman, OK"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/university-of-oklahoma/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"3ccbb87c-1a04-431b-86fa-3471be039be9","badge":{"display":"Best Colleges for Criminal Justice in America","ordinal":166,"total":484,"vanityURL":"best-colleges-for-criminal-justice"},"content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"University of Louisville","type":"College","url":"university-of-louisville"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.7257},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":16249},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"1000-1240"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Graduate Student","body":"The University of Louisville staff is amazing.

Seton Hall athletics is one of the best parts of campus life. With 14 D1 sports teams there is always a game to watch and cheer on. The men's basketball team plays at the Prudential Center in Newark, NJ and they play in the Big East Conference. Going to basketball games is a highlight of the school year!\nOverall, social life on campus is awesome. There is always stuff to do on campus during the week and the weekends. Greek life is available on campus but will not make or break your experience. Like any school, it all depends on your willingness to put yourself out there - and SHU provides more than enough opportunities to do so. \nAlso, the FOOD is good!

There are some rough professors that don’t teach very well but they are outnumbered by ones that you will have an easier time learning from. The campus has many organizations you can join, you will not get bored here. Also, the president and his wife are very involved in student life and never hesitates to carry a conversation! Highly recommend this school.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2018-01-25T03:48:21.754921Z","guid":"7c644fa4-03fd-47e7-9e57-b3db921e96fd","rating":5},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":3}],"photos":{"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-98.22008,32.215665,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-98.22008,32.215665,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.7155555555555555,"count":1575},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Stephenville, TX"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/tarleton-state-university/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"6286c2d6-4eac-4036-a834-b347fb976f55","badge":{"display":"Best Colleges for Criminal Justice in America","ordinal":183,"total":484,"vanityURL":"best-colleges-for-criminal-justice"},"content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":true,"isPremium":false,"name":"East Carolina University","type":"College","url":"east-carolina-university"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.7034},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":12817},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"970-1130"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Freshman","body":"East Carolina is a great four-year North Carolina college that specializes in nursing, business, fine arts, and music programs. The Honors College is growing in size and popularity, and offers unique research and networking opportunities for members. ECU also is one of the more generous North Carolina schools considering financial aid and more relaxed entrance requirements, giving students a chance at pursuing a higher education. Despite ECU's avid party life and prevalent Greek culture, you can expect to make the best of your experience and get a quality education!","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2018-02-09T14:31:47.300782Z","guid":"3408928a-e9f4-4745-9f24-5719855d0feb","rating":4},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":3.33}],"photos":{"default":{"crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/e72f4e2343ba7c186a4b9e0c97f476da86b95e0b.jpg","MobileHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/ebf486e743c87abc25a5ed790054eb3d5294baad.jpg"},"licenseName":"UNLICENSED"},"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-77.366199,35.606347,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-77.366199,35.606347,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.7252167357708257,"count":2653},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Greenville, NC"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/east-carolina-university/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"bf4bec4a-cc96-473f-9567-1b1ecc7b0e7b","badge":{"display":"Best Colleges for Criminal Justice in America","ordinal":184,"total":484,"vanityURL":"best-colleges-for-criminal-justice"},"content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":true,"isPremium":false,"name":"Keuka College","type":"College","url":"keuka-college"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.77},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":24126},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"840-1050"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Senior","body":"My experience at Keuka College has been great! I have learned so much and made so many friends that I will keep in touch with for a lifetime. One of my favorite things about Keuka College is that it is a small campus and everyone you see is a familiar face. You are likely to develop a personal bond with most/all of your professors, and your professors know you by name, you're not just a number. If you are struggling in one of your classes, you can go to your professors office hours and get all of the help you need. Your professors set you up for success, not for failure. The campus is small and everything is within walking distance, which is really nice, especially when you're in a hurry. The college tries their best to offer activities for you to keep you busy, and of course, the lake being right in your backyard is a huge benefit!","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2017-01-24T00:22:25.334457Z","guid":"d489e6a2-8177-4803-9690-b53b0aef2c33","rating":4},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":2.66}],"photos":{"default":{"crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/e7eac12490c47bda531ce5c6250459f21c38535f.jpg","MobileHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/63f2c575d68f4a0a999f9dee228836318833513b.jpg"},"licenseName":"UNLICENSED"},"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-77.090518,42.61541,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-77.090518,42.61541,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.309823677581864,"count":397},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Keuka Park, NY"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/keuka-college/#scatterplot"}}]}
