It is a small campus so you most likely know everyone in the classroom. The further in your major you get, the more attention and help you will get from your professor because your class size will be so small. The professors seem intimidating in the basic classes because they are trying to \"weed out\" the student who do not belong in the major, but as you progress they are your greatest helpers. The professors just want to see you succeed. As far as campus involvement, there is a lot to do on campus during the week but less on the weekend because it is generally a commuter campus. There are a variety of clubs offered and there seems to be one for everyone, if you cannot find one you can create one!","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2018-02-14T02:43:58.536572Z","guid":"bdcbbc0e-010b-47a4-884f-b0499397ecb6","rating":4},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":2.66}],"photos":{"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-79.535757,40.292824,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-79.535757,40.292824,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.3202416918429,"count":331},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Greensburg, PA"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/university-of-pittsburgh---greensburg/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"ca9e78bf-8de1-4bd5-bf56-44aaa482e523","content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":true,"isPremium":false,"name":"CUNY Brooklyn College","type":"College","url":"cuny-brooklyn-college"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.3749},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":9771},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"1010-1200"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Junior","body":"Going to Brooklyn College was the best decision I ever made.

I took out loans the first two years, but received a full-ride the last two years.\nAbout 90% of my profess were intellectually stimulating and very friendly. They welcome students during office hours and actually want to see you succeed. The advisors are the BEST! They are very supportive. The business career center is a great asset of UIC. The advisors help students find internships and full-time jobs after graduation.\nOverall, I would rate UIC a 8.2/10.

The actual DEAN of my department spent over an hour with me helping to map out my first semester by going over different course selections available for me, helping to make sure I didn't waste time or money picking classes that would not benefit my intended major. The academics are challenging and many employers see Stockton University as a highly credited institution to graduate from. I highly recommend any student looking for a college where they will easily fit in and belong.

Highly recommend to anyone interested in attending a SUNY school in NY!","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2017-09-27T14:11:38.127297Z","guid":"00750c89-32db-49b5-8e2f-e5567883c4ba","rating":5},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":3}],"photos":{"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-77.949824,43.209862,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-77.949824,43.209862,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.4708063021316033,"count":1079},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Brockport, NY"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/suny-college-at-brockport/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"a1e8a7c2-5d02-4d39-9dea-179078f9721e","content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"Western Kentucky University","type":"College","url":"western-kentucky-university"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.9402},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":11409},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"860-1090"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Freshman","body":"I’ve only been at WKU for one semester, but I’m already in love. As a student who is trying to pay their way through college on their own, WKU gives me the flexibility I need. Not only do they offer an abundance of scholarships to aid your education, but they offer a wide selection of classes as well. This has helped me as I work full time so the online and night courses they offer have been a perfect fit. But most importantly, Western Kentucky feels like home. This university is a community that welcomes everyone with open arms, and I’m a proud Hilltopper!","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2017-12-29T03:26:02.359593Z","guid":"6f869d95-fa69-49af-9fdf-3993ddcad022","rating":5},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":2.66}],"photos":{"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-86.455898,36.985718,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-86.455898,36.985718,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.640641158221303,"count":1934},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Bowling Green, KY"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/western-kentucky-university/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"7f16885e-49fd-4ded-8203-f30f5db7b2f7","content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"Central Michigan University","type":"College","url":"central-michigan-university"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.7156},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":14275},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"890-1140"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Alum","body":"CMU is a great school to attend if you're into a college that doesn't seem overwhelming. Even though there is roughly 25,000 students, the layout of the campus makes you feel like the school is not that big! There are a lot of activities to do and it's very easy to make friends and meet new people. The class sizes are also pretty small making the class experience seem less intimidating and you actually feel like you will contribute something to the class instead of being \"one out of many\".","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2018-04-19T05:52:26.400792Z","guid":"59d86f41-44bb-4030-93c8-1b185f994807","rating":4},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":3.33}],"photos":{"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-84.775275,43.591137,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-84.775275,43.591137,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.6471045472211427,"count":2573},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Mount Pleasant, MI"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/central-michigan-university/#scatterplot"}}]}
