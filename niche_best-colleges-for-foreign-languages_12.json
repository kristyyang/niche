The campus is beautiful and everyone is so welcoming.  I felt at home the first time I visited and automatically I knew UK was the school I wanted to attend.  There's a whole week of activities in August before classes start specifically for incoming freshman to get them acclimated to the university and show them everything UK has to offer.  There are numerous tutoring services and most professors are flexible with their office hours to find a time that works for the student.  Almost everyday there's a different activity happening on campus, from goat yoga and Pinterest parties for stress relief, to live music and food to spend time with friends, to tailgates before sports games to support our Wildcats with the most spirit.  It's clear that the university strives to create the best environment for students' success and well-being.

The professors care a lot about their students and how well they do. It is a liberal arts college meaning that they focus on teaching the students the importance of learning multiple subjects rather than having expertise in only one area. The school has the Integrated Studies course that everyone is required to take. Freshmen take \"Introduction to Liberal Arts,\" sophomores take \"Global Perspectives,\" juniors take \"Reflections,\" and seniors take a course on \"Citizenship.\" These courses help the students become aware of their communities and get them involved in helping to make the world a more welcoming and overall a better place. Because the school is in a very small town, it is not as diverse as other schools closer to the cities and big towns. However, everyone is welcoming and very helpful. They emphasize the importance of helping one another and the professors are excellent in helping their students achieve and reach their highest potential.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2018-01-20T05:12:47.114922Z","guid":"0cd35397-14df-4fdf-ac0f-35ddc8617049","rating":4},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":3}],"photos":{"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-90.637909,40.91459,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-90.637909,40.91459,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.4891944990176817,"count":509},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Monmouth, IL"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/monmouth-college/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"b8b0b015-4c19-47e8-bc54-f704470b5d1e","badge":{"display":"Best Colleges in America","ordinal":140,"total":1644,"vanityURL":"best-colleges"},"content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":true,"isPremium":false,"name":"University of Oklahoma","type":"College","url":"university-of-oklahoma"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.7084},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":17966},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"1060-1345"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Sophomore","body":"Very big & beautiful school with something for everyone! A lot of opportunities for internships, leadership positions and involvement. A lot of research opportunities and very good professors as well, especially for a public university. Despite the perception, OU is a lot more than just football and greek life. However, I would recommend that after freshman year, you live somewhere within walking distance to campus, because the parking here is absolutely awful and you will absolutely regret commuting to campus and spending nearly 2 hours looking for a parking spot everyday, even with a parking pass that costs hundreds of dollars. Also Dale Hall is a ridiculous building and if you have a class there, get there early because trying to make your way through the crowds in that building can sometimes take a while. The parking situation & Dale Hall is the only thing preventing me from giving this great school 5 stars.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2017-11-06T00:20:34.290457Z","guid":"75f25a4a-6e57-4df8-b0a2-0b3897295b1c","rating":4},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":4}],"photos":{"default":{"crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/6a7d7e2d5c708a009e6b4857db0d69cf2efb39c4.jpg","MobileHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/eeb1688e862a426894b97137be0e4145307a7a24.jpg","Thumbnail":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/0dfb8859200ebd86bfb0acaf4b7740bcc6822455"},"licenseName":"UNLICENSED"},"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-97.445692,35.208152,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-97.445692,35.208152,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.7810136157337366,"count":2644},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Norman, OK"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/university-of-oklahoma/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"4f36b886-599a-46bb-9861-e309e3a699d5","badge":{"display":"Best Colleges in America","ordinal":763,"total":1644,"vanityURL":"best-colleges"},"content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"Eastern Kentucky University","type":"College","url":"eastern-kentucky-university"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.8633},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":12255},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"930-1140"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Freshman","body":"I have only been here one full semester, but I already love this college.

There is almost always some activity happening on campus, so there is rarely ever nothing to do.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2017-10-14T18:47:09.551789Z","guid":"12572261-c260-4110-b0d1-35511cae09ea","rating":4},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":3}],"photos":{"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-76.543885,43.453047,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-76.543885,43.453047,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.5,"count":1302},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Oswego, NY"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/suny-oswego/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"134539d5-e860-4c36-85f9-a5cc48d67109","badge":{"display":"Best Colleges in America","ordinal":233,"total":1644,"vanityURL":"best-colleges"},"content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"Texas Tech University","type":"College","url":"texas-tech-university"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.626},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":15235},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"1020-1200"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Freshman","body":"Texas Tech University is a fantastic place to go to school.

Staff are always willing to help students and make them feel like they're at home. Professors are approachable and are always willing to hear what you have to say. There's tremendously unique experiences that NMSU provides for students. Aside from experiences there's also different kind of activities and organizations where I can find a perfect match to what I like to do and people just get to collaborate with one another. There's over 180+ degrees in NMSU to pick from and just the fact that they had the perfect match to the degree that I wanted to pursue. A couple of things that I think the campus needs to work on is the dorms on campus, there's always something negative that's happening whether is the water, undistinguished smells, door locks.

There's free tutoring if needed\nUNH works with most study abroad programs. It's discovery credit system makes it easy for credits to transfer towards your major. \nFor food It's in the top 1% of USA. There's 3 dining halls as well as shops all around campus. It's unbelievable(trust me on this)\nD1 Aka sports events are crazy.

There’s a home for everyone at the University of Louisiana at Lafayette!","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2018-05-09T04:14:20.901973Z","guid":"1ded70e4-c554-4ec6-8bb2-7cac61331b2c","rating":4},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":3.66}],"photos":{"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-92.01941,30.215283,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-92.01941,30.215283,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.6619607843137256,"count":1275},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Lafayette, LA"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/university-of-louisiana---lafayette/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"196a9a76-7cf1-4788-bdbd-da34ef63baf9","badge":{"display":"Best Colleges in America","ordinal":422,"total":1644,"vanityURL":"best-colleges"},"content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"Western Michigan University","type":"College","url":"western-michigan-university"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.8231},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":15489},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"900-1115"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Junior","body":"I loved the people who attends Western as well as the faculty and staff. Western has really allowed me to get out my comfort zone and expand with the variety of different people, clubs, and organizations. Western has tons of opportunities to help you grow as a student and into an adult. There are so many Registered Student Organizations (RSO) on campus. I love that being a student on campus you can voice your opinions and feel comfortable doing so. There are places on campus for the LGBT community to go and feel safe! Western makes sure you can get the full experience and still learn.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2018-05-31T23:22:56.49844Z","guid":"3b5da4f7-ee68-4b64-98a7-66e6c3022d88","rating":5},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":3.33}],"photos":{"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-85.61512,42.282589,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-85.61512,42.282589,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.675547098001903,"count":3153},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Kalamazoo, MI"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/western-michigan-university/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"62369217-8abf-4ff4-b8db-d1f27dcb1972","badge":{"display":"Best Colleges in America","ordinal":208,"total":1644,"vanityURL":"best-colleges"},"content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"University of Central Florida","type":"College","url":"university-of-central-florida"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.4999},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":15533},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"1080-1270"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Senior","body":"My experience at the University of Central Florida is everything that any student that ever dreamed of going to college to ever imagine. Taking into consideration that UCF is the second largest University in the United States of America, you could say that it is a pretty intimidating start of a new begining. Although, with my professors, student life, leadership opportunities, clubs/organizations, and the overall structure of the campus itself has made my experience thus far absolutely amazing.

They are engaging with great professors that are approachable outside of lecture. The professors for the music classes are especially great and have made it easy to stay in music even as a non-music major. Getting between classes can be a little difficult as a biology music student but the campus is bike-able which helps a lot! There are so many clubs on campus it is hard to limit yourself to just a handful. I am active in two clubs but also get updates and information for another two clubs. There is lots of outdoor space for enjoying nice weather, which helps for getting out of studying slumps.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2017-08-04T19:36:49.542789Z","guid":"68f5391b-1bc7-4a1c-aba6-d087e541c3e7","rating":5},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":3.66}],"photos":{"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-105.57204,41.311943,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-105.57204,41.311943,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.513142857142857,"count":1750},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Laramie, WY"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/university-of-wyoming/#scatterplot"}}]}
