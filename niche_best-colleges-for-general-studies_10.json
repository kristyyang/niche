UMSL has opportunities for developing leadership, networking, mentoring and team concepts that can put you on a path to achieve your educational goal. Current statistics of high school dropout rates and lack of accreditation of schools convinces me there is an opportunity for me to become a part of the solution.  My passion is to help the youth.

The Princeton Environmental institute does classes with local farmers using a variety of methods and chefs from many culinary backgrounds.\n\nWhat I like most about Princeton is the community.

Now as an alumni, I would like to see Wake Forest put a little more effort into promoting career planning and skills for all majors and especially those in STEM subjects that might not know what the possibilities are.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2018-05-12T15:49:59.285747Z","guid":"b5278eb6-4889-4cf3-ba08-3e32c2f7566d","rating":4},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":4.33}],"photos":{"default":{"author":"86103678@N05","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/0d3809106b922bd8a27261cf03434fd8ac52c401.jpg","MobileHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/d1912cbf393cbe794f496da5108c3f647cddf14d.jpg","Thumbnail":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/3833938e6620eefa3bb03fe47043f27e321e9eb7"},"licenseName":"CC BY ","licenseUrl":"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/2.0/","sourceUrl":"https://www.flickr.com/photos/86103678@N05/19783500913/"},"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-80.279004,36.135301,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-80.279004,36.135301,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.664,"count":750},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Winston-Salem, NC"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/wake-forest-university/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"1a858692-13b7-4c44-9466-9ce7393eb807","content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"Georgia Southern University - Armstrong","type":"College","url":"georgia-southern-university---armstrong"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.8038},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":18854},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"890-1080"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Sophomore","body":"Armstrong is amazing!

The campus is a very inviting environment; there are always events going on whether it is sports, diversity, or arts. The professors give off a warm, caring  aroma. No student should be afraid to ask for help from their professor; they are always willing whether it is through office hours or email. MSUM offers many ways to help students succeed; from tutoring to the Wellness Center for physical health. The campus is just the right size, not too small yet not overwhelming as well. As soon as I visited MSUM my senior year of high school, I knew it was home. Though, what I would like to see change is the exclusion from some activities held on campus. For example, they have activities that exclude some students from clubs or learning communities. I wish for more equality in allowing all students to be involved. Otherwise, I believe MSUM is a great place full of opportunities for students to further their education.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2017-11-26T05:07:52.397844Z","guid":"0ece1c33-a37d-4bed-abe0-cadcfc074cbc","rating":4},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":3}],"photos":{"default":{"crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/db9b3a0ff27f272424f505083bf388c9377f84cd.jpg","MobileHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/9579f183666104e0e7185a4591a4b5f6878c5147.jpg"},"licenseName":"UNLICENSED"},"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-96.763376,46.866482,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-96.763376,46.866482,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.4360795454545454,"count":704},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Moorhead, MN"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/minnesota-state-university-moorhead/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"1d82d046-ae89-4750-92ef-06f75376f8b3","badge":{"display":"Best Colleges in America","ordinal":264,"total":1644,"vanityURL":"best-colleges"},"content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"Mercer University","type":"College","url":"mercer-university"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.6935},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":20692},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"1100-1290"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Senior","body":"Mercer University is a great school overall. The people here made me feel so welcome, and I truly felt like part of a family during my 3 years as a student. Most of the professors are incredible people; I could tell they wanted to see me do well. Because of the small class sizes, it is really easy to build relationships with your professors and get to know other students. For me, this really helped to ensure my success in classes. In addition, there are lots of organizations and volunteer opportunities on campus to help students get involved in the community and feel at home. The campus is absolutely beautiful! However, housing isn't the greatest; some of the dorms are rather old. A few dorms are new or have been renovated recently, so those offer a better living situation. Also, there aren't many food options on campus, and I rarely visited some, as the food was inedible. The meal plans they offer are ridiculous and are not at all worth the money you are asked to spend.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2018-05-16T15:00:30.995265Z","guid":"d47ebb91-ecd3-4e3c-be64-d26c66817072","rating":4},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":3.66}],"photos":{"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-83.651042,32.829731,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-83.651042,32.829731,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.582269503546099,"count":1410},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Macon, GA"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/mercer-university/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"df08b6b6-abc3-4281-910e-40845aeeee5d","content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"Keene State College","type":"College","url":"keene-state-college"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.8253},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":18647},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"880-1070"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Alum","body":"Keene State College is accepting of students from all walks of life.

The academics aren't easy- especially the STEM programs, which are structured to be some of the most rigorous in the country, but that's why we have such a good reputation and ease with post-graduation placements.

Even though the food is not the best on campus, do not feel discouraged because the food off campus is always a hit! Dorms are mostly average, some are great while some of the older buildings definitely need renovation. Athletics are a big plus to this school whether you will be playing or in the audience. The school is strongly affiliated with the Catholic faith, however, all of the professors and Dominican Friars will be welcoming of all religious backgrounds.

Purchase is a great choice for those looking to be challenged.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2018-01-02T22:06:09.803996Z","guid":"3aa575f9-88e4-4972-9f8f-97f97c72c86b","rating":4},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":3}],"photos":{"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-73.700127,41.047092,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-73.700127,41.047092,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.376084860173578,"count":1037},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Purchase, NY"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/suny-purchase-college/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"f78f2ee4-a901-4d21-b96f-9cc9be5e8291","content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"SUNY College at Old Westbury","type":"College","url":"suny-college-at-old-westbury"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.686},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":10050},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"880-1060"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Freshman","body":"Went to SUNY College at Old Westbury open house this weekend and this college is very welcoming. Everyone greeted me with open arms, and was very polite. The open house was set up in a creative manner, with different presentations going on in classrooms based on different majors. These presentations were very helpful, for instance the business school presentation open my mind up to how it would be for me going into an accounting major. The presentation also stemmed out of just the business school, and Old Westbury in general.

The people you meet are truly incredible. There is a great community at Pepperdine, people truly care and there are so many fun things to do in the area.

You live/travel in a country for a semester/year with your best friends. Pepperdine is making a big effort to create healthy dialogue about racial, sexual, and religious diversity, and gender equality.
