My major as an occupational therapy assistant narrowed down my search and I ended up finding Central Penn College. I went for a visit and knew it was everything I was looking for it was small, a close knit community, no parties and so much student life! Central Penn was the only college that I applied to which was very risky but I got in!! With the program and the scheduling at Central Penn I will be able to finish in 1.5 years and get right into the work field. I`m so glad to say that I go to Central Penn College! The one thing that frustrates me at the moment is the schedule and the fact that I have to go to school over the summer but when I am working and everyone I graduated with still has 2 years if college it will all pay off!","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2018-02-18T01:22:33.472378Z","guid":"c7cc1280-e5e5-40e5-b2b9-43d5c3b52a5c","rating":5},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":2.33}],"photos":{"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-76.934461,40.3049,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-76.934461,40.3049,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.8642533936651584,"count":221},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Summerdale, PA"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/central-penn-college/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"b7c5c6c9-6a6f-4a1f-b098-c71ddd41de83","badge":{"display":"Best Colleges in America","ordinal":68,"total":1644,"vanityURL":"best-colleges"},"content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"University of Georgia","type":"College","url":"university-of-georgia"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.539},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":14956},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"1140-1340"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Sophomore","body":"This is university is perfect for students hoping to have fun while at college.

The weather is wonderful; we have all four seasons. Flagstaff is especially great if you enjoy the outdoors since we're close to the Grand Canyon and other national parks. The instructors are wonderful (that I've had) and they take the time to get to know their students. Academically, if you take the time to study and communicate with your instructors then it's not too difficult. There are also a lot of academic resources (for free) that NAU provides for their students to succeed in their classes. Overall, NAU is a solid university to attend and I'm glad that I picked it.

The campus buildings and dorms are kept clean and updated - which is a huge plus to recompense their weaknesses. The student life here is dull since most people are commuters and the students only hang around with people from their high school. The food here is from good to average in some days.

Despite all of its flaws and imperfections, it is a safe space where I can explore and learn. The campus itself is a small city with features that make it feel more cozy than full-out sophisticated. From our beautiful Cathedral of Learning (we lovingly call her Cathy) to the spacious Schenley Park, there are tons of secret nooks that are perfect for studying. The professors, while teaching multiple classes, still make themselves available for questions outside the classroom. They are never too busy to stop and chat if you see them around campus; they really care about your education and that you have a passion for what you are studying.

Don't expect to pay tuition and love it - get involved, talk to your professors, do community service, look into study abroad, talk to your classmates, do research!  There is plenty there if you grab it.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2018-05-25T19:01:31.291123Z","guid":"5e5fed39-5d34-462e-9cae-0ed359833037","rating":5},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":2.66}],"photos":{"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-83.624499,42.245751,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-83.624499,42.245751,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.4503844745514463,"count":2731},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Ypsilanti, MI"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/eastern-michigan-university/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"99dfa085-aceb-4d7f-86a6-915fd8d16484","content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"University of North Georgia","type":"College","url":"university-of-north-georgia"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.7504},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":9608},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"820-1020"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Junior","body":"It was a huge culture shock!

I highly recommend because of the size (big enough that you'll meet a lot of people, small enough that you'll feel known in your classes - most are 25-100 people) and the location and price - you can't beat the dorms!","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2017-12-27T23:49:16.69583Z","guid":"1e7538d9-136a-443f-8cea-36b24e593c75","rating":4},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":2.66}],"photos":{"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-85.299812,35.048247,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-85.299812,35.048247,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.556716417910448,"count":1340},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Chattanooga, TN"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/university-of-tennessee---chattanooga/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"9a3df9ba-aaf8-43c2-ba2e-40ba1d1cdaf9","badge":{"display":"Best Colleges in America","ordinal":655,"total":1644,"vanityURL":"best-colleges"},"content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"Ferris State University","type":"College","url":"ferris-state-university"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.7769},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":13204},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"910-1180"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Junior","body":"Ferris State University is a small University located in Big Rapids, MI.

My professor was amazing, and so was the music program as a whole. I was able to pursue a double major with an outside field, and while it was difficult and busy, the administration helped me every quarter by allowing me to take extra classes to finish on time. The campus is beautiful, but there is always construction. It is not a huge party school, but there are parties and lots of other ways to have fun. I loved the proximity to Chicago and the public transit system. Overall, I liked the student body. There was a general hard work ethic, and though my majors weren't particularly competitive, I know there were some that were fairly cut-throat. The mental health services can be improved upon, but I felt that NU was a very accepting, diverse, and progressive school overall. Financial aid was great, and getting better!","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2017-04-03T16:31:19.352213Z","guid":"77a1ff5b-99e3-42ae-b31e-9fa72bcd15d9","rating":4},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":4.33}],"photos":{"default":{"author":"ejojola","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/b7492bc80d986826d01503deb309e7bb25c1ef13.jpg","MobileHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/ecffae88eb638f3f8e5d9a683b557be333846b62.jpg","Thumbnail":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/46356a9a4b34266703c552d29b73c721c0836ec0"},"licenseName":"CC BY ","licenseUrl":"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/2.0/","sourceUrl":"https://www.flickr.com/photos/ejojola/3769200519/"},"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-87.673653,42.058377,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-87.673653,42.058377,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.6045066045066045,"count":1287},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Evanston, IL"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/northwestern-university/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"29847b65-b92f-4a67-84af-078741efc935","badge":{"display":"Best Colleges in America","ordinal":654,"total":1644,"vanityURL":"best-colleges"},"content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"University of Montana","type":"College","url":"university-of-montana"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.9243},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":13894},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"950-1200"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Sophomore","body":"The main reason I love going to school here is simply the location and all of the outdoor activities around.
