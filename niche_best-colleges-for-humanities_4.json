The student to professor ratio is unparalleled. The course is laborious, but when you are studying something of interest, the work isn't as bad. The professors actually care about you and your academic success, which is really nice when you're having a hard time with the material. I've already learned a lot in my field, and I feel like this experience is unlike any other university. The dorms are okay--depending on the building. Hill House is okay, but can feel isolated due to the location. Taylor is a typical dorm. There are other options, but the with housing lottery can be tough to get where you prefer to live. There are several places within walking distance to eat and shop. The train station is within walking distance, and it's only a 30 minute ride to NYC.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2018-04-30T19:04:34.489258Z","guid":"07bb27d4-8991-4cd0-b61c-b8a9fc82e24d","rating":4},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":3}],"photos":{"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-73.84381,40.934147,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-73.84381,40.934147,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.42914979757085,"count":494},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Bronxville, NY"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/sarah-lawrence-college/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"a5576ab4-5b41-41d4-a687-6a0c32318e9a","badge":{"display":"Best Colleges in America","ordinal":62,"total":1644,"vanityURL":"best-colleges"},"content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"University of Florida","type":"College","url":"university-of-florida"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.4594},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":14761},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"1180-1370"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Freshman","body":"The University of Florida has provided me with the experience to not only growth in an academic perspective but also in my personal development.

And if you venture to the reading room you will be in for a treat for this room is none other than the Hogwarts dining hall!","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2018-01-27T20:34:11.594243Z","guid":"29de464c-700f-40a0-bde3-d920c56ac714","rating":5},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":4.33}],"photos":{"default":{"author":"jepoirrier","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/45e7bca3427caf2820c25bf15029341f8c448028.jpg","MobileHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/24f98ad777a2dffd6c49621b3ff1d45a86f3ae5f.jpg","Thumbnail":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/563917ac5c71d15dfb7eb9c0135a8d9e9926b7ba"},"licenseName":"CC BY-SA","licenseUrl":"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/","sourceUrl":"https://www.flickr.com/photos/jepoirrier/4736478333/"},"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-122.313115,47.656213,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-122.313115,47.656213,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.7020304568527918,"count":3940},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Seattle, WA"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/university-of-washington/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"9d9a9977-4c96-45c6-8a12-b8be71a34936","badge":{"display":"Best Colleges in America","ordinal":84,"total":1644,"vanityURL":"best-colleges"},"content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"Brigham Young University","type":"College","url":"brigham-young-university"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.5118},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":12864},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"1160-1380"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Freshman","body":"The school is definitely difficult but very rewarding.

The social scene for the most part, given that Greek life makes up 70% of the student body (Union butchers this statistic as it includes freshman, even though you can't pledge until sophomore year) is getting blackout and going to an off campus party nowadays.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2016-12-22T18:45:44.991174Z","guid":"3f25e605-a90b-4599-8c44-58eda1d27e16","rating":4},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":4}],"photos":{"default":{"author":"jirka_matousek","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/1c50f212b43127310b4796fcdc08c4db170301ea.jpg","MobileHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/a085f7463737d2d7a537e43fac12c8fa2f8c5316.jpg","Thumbnail":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/ff1a2a9f6b4a027509cca9cc5f8c02efce604fcd"},"licenseName":"CC BY ","licenseUrl":"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/2.0/","sourceUrl":"https://www.flickr.com/photos/jirka_matousek/8374084149/"},"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-73.928498,42.817578,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-73.928498,42.817578,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.601923076923077,"count":520},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Schenectady, NY"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/union-college---new-york/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"4a4fe604-d453-446d-986a-c1de1ee249c4","badge":{"display":"Best Colleges in America","ordinal":85,"total":1644,"vanityURL":"best-colleges"},"content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":true,"isPremium":false,"name":"University of Minnesota - Twin Cities","type":"College","url":"university-of-minnesota---twin-cities"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.4441},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":16242},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"1180-1450"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Niche User","body":"The University of Minnesota is a welcoming, lively, and beautiful university.
