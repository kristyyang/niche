Therefore, when I applied to colleges first of all I looked if they have a good undergraduate research opportunities. In MIT with the help UROP I could start researching even from freshman class.\n2. Its pass no record style of educating freshmen. There is no grading in the first semester. Instead, one gets \"Pass\" or \"Fail\" in his or her transcript. It allows students not to stress too much on grades, but explore the university and majors.\n3. Of course it is the best university in the field of chemical engineering. Top notch professors, smart peers and the best laboratories makes MIT unique.\n4. It's financially available for all international students. MIT's need blind policy makes it affordable for all who want to attend it.\n\nI hope it helps!","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2017-12-28T19:46:12.988166Z","guid":"6a2f1b8a-1afe-4ef8-944b-b2dd08d2ab87","rating":5},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":4.33}],"photos":{"default":{"author":"justinjensen","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/9e4d828e5f5cfe5eac16bdee876a58919082288f.jpg","MobileHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/3dbd39d4c1401beb7773c38566cc4d728d7db4ed.jpg","Thumbnail":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/557facfa37e7e3a49d452635d811fd839d0145b2"},"licenseName":"CC BY ","licenseUrl":"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/2.0/","sourceUrl":"https://www.flickr.com/photos/justinjensen/4979561102/in/album-72157623671307590/"},"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-71.092115,42.360095,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-71.092115,42.360095,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":4.078859060402684,"count":596},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Cambridge, MA"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/massachusetts-institute-of-technology/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"9bb50435-ca9f-41e5-b2a1-01e53da77435","content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"Alabama A&M University","type":"College","url":"alabama-a-and-m-university"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.8738},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":15547},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"750-940"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Junior","body":"Alabama A&M University is the best HBCU in Alabama!

The campus is a very inviting environment; there are always events going on whether it is sports, diversity, or arts. The professors give off a warm, caring  aroma. No student should be afraid to ask for help from their professor; they are always willing whether it is through office hours or email. MSUM offers many ways to help students succeed; from tutoring to the Wellness Center for physical health. The campus is just the right size, not too small yet not overwhelming as well. As soon as I visited MSUM my senior year of high school, I knew it was home. Though, what I would like to see change is the exclusion from some activities held on campus. For example, they have activities that exclude some students from clubs or learning communities. I wish for more equality in allowing all students to be involved. Otherwise, I believe MSUM is a great place full of opportunities for students to further their education.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2017-11-26T05:07:52.397844Z","guid":"0ece1c33-a37d-4bed-abe0-cadcfc074cbc","rating":4},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":3}],"photos":{"default":{"crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/db9b3a0ff27f272424f505083bf388c9377f84cd.jpg","MobileHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/9579f183666104e0e7185a4591a4b5f6878c5147.jpg"},"licenseName":"UNLICENSED"},"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-96.763376,46.866482,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-96.763376,46.866482,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.4360795454545454,"count":704},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Moorhead, MN"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/minnesota-state-university-moorhead/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"7099c1c4-b34b-4969-9434-226a0a3a3933","content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"Bradley University","type":"College","url":"bradley-university"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.6981},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":26773},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"960-1240"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Senior","body":"Bradley, being a smaller school than a state school, allows students the opportunity to more easily connect with professors in a meaningful way.

There are many resources to take advantage of as well. Overall, Fayetteville State is an excellent university. I am able to maintain good grades, along with having fun and a social life. If I could go back and make a college decision again, I would still choose Fayetteville State. I felt like I was at home the very first visit here.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2018-05-03T22:04:09.495066Z","guid":"c6205d57-f7ff-4cc6-bb18-c99d0ee124c8","rating":4},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":2.66}],"photos":{"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-78.894709,35.072485,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-78.894709,35.072485,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.4861294583883753,"count":757},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Fayetteville, NC"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/fayetteville-state-university/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"24d22173-9460-4b09-a17e-eb442f338a8d","content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":true,"isPremium":false,"name":"Augusta University","type":"College","url":"augusta-university"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.7723},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":13180},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"940-1140"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Freshman","body":"It's a good college, they give you what you need without bothering you with a whole bunch of unnecessary stuff, which they do but it's easy to ignore.
