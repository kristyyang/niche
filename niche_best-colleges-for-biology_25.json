The campus and over-all environment is friendly and full of life. The professors really seem to harness the one on one student relationships and make you seen as an individual.

The dorms and campus provide many program opportunities varying from speakers to performers.  As for the town life, it is on the more boring side.

Some days inside the buildings would be hotter than outside.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2018-04-19T23:22:10.198645Z","guid":"54616b70-eef3-4720-8fd1-53991ec05e30","rating":4},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":2.66}],"photos":{"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-80.854368,33.497367,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-80.854368,33.497367,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.3775137111517366,"count":1094},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Orangeburg, SC"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/claflin-university/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"c9e1442b-be11-410c-834f-dbdcca75532e","content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"Bay Path University","type":"College","url":"bay-path-university"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.5992},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":22012},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"845-1065"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Junior","body":"Being a Junior here my experience has been great.

I got a really cool internship through the career services and completed a fulfilling work-study.\n\nI took classes and electives in several departments outside my major, including education, communication and psychology, and I gained a lot of practical knowledge. Professors are intelligent, funny, and made learning feel less like work. Definitely recommend the senior capstone project required by several majors because it gives you the research and writing skills needed to do a master's thesis project closely supervised by faculty.\n\nStudent body is quiet but has a lot of neat interests and passions.

It is a beautiful little campus that is nice and peaceful, and you get to meet a lot of new and wonderful people.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2017-01-28T06:14:47.121493Z","guid":"fc794952-c206-47fb-b55c-7c9fc9c05309","rating":5},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":3}],"photos":{"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-82.37026,35.069758,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-82.37026,35.069758,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.6914498141263943,"count":538},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Tigerville, SC"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/north-greenville-university/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"d8cb3f59-b5da-4ea3-8bf2-82e2e592bcd9","content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"University of Louisiana - Monroe","type":"College","url":"university-of-louisiana---monroe"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.7613},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":9145},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"950-1360"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Freshman","body":"My experience at the University of Louisiana-Monroe has been wonderful! I just completed my Freshman year and it was better than I expected. All of my professors were very helpful in teaching and guide myself as well as other students. The facilities were up to date and if renovations were needed, it would be taken care of with no hastle. The campus life was always buzzing with free lunch socials, carnivals in the campus park, guest speakers, and other activities to allow students to become more engaged as well as prepare for future plans. I never encountered a problem regarding a safety issue or complained about a professor’s approach to a topic. I would highly reccomend ULM to anyone and everyone considering a 4-year university!","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2018-05-23T00:40:20.803639Z","guid":"352b9855-a5e8-4a9d-9925-a2d98d9f81e9","rating":5},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":3}],"photos":{"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-92.073855,32.527957,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-92.073855,32.527957,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.5638629283489096,"count":642},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Monroe, LA"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/university-of-louisiana---monroe/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"012622c4-424f-457a-9d67-383c10fdfb2f","content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"Molloy College","type":"College","url":"molloy-college"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.7692},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":27839},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"980-1170"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Junior","body":"I transferred to Molloy College to the social work program about two years or so ago. Since attending Molloy College, I have gained trustworthy, and beneficial relationships with my department's faculty and staff members. I must say the staff listen to each student's concerns and comments and work hard to continuing its success in the social work program. Here you will be able to meet colleagues that will work alongside you to make it through the program. In addition, this program also offers an internship during your senior year, which is extremely beneficial when deciding which population you would like to work with as you move on to graduate school!","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2018-01-30T18:52:08.833982Z","guid":"41a682d6-e8df-4a5b-81e4-07b49f561bf3","rating":4},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":3}],"photos":{"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-73.626278,40.68597,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-73.626278,40.68597,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.8411214953271027,"count":535},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Rockville Centre, NY"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/molloy-college/#scatterplot"}}]}
