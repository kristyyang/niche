Hunter offers a plethora of majors to choose from as well as different clubs to keep students engaged. There are also activities and events held on campus. The workload may be overwhelming at times but I regard it as excellent preparation for graduate school and an opportunity to challenge myself. The location of Hunter is convenient; it is located in the city so your choices don't fall short when it comes to food. Hunter has a library on nine floors. My complaint is that when you attend Hunter no one tells you anything unless you ask many, many questions! I know several people who took the incorrect class for their major, wasting time and money. Additionally, I feel that in large lecture halls with more than 100 students, there isn't a chance to receive individualized attention. The classroom size should be smaller so professors can focus on every students' needs and struggles.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2018-01-16T22:01:16.773582Z","guid":"61dee6aa-64ee-4526-9449-0dd06859694f","rating":4},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":3}],"photos":{"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-73.964795,40.768669,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-73.964795,40.768669,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.439636752136752,"count":1872},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"New York, NY"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/cuny-hunter-college/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"2d5ec7da-c961-4380-b3c8-391c18cce632","content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":true,"isPremium":true,"name":"Drew University","type":"College","url":"drew-university"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.56},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":25167},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"1030-1250"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Senior","body":"Drew University is a small liberal arts college in suburban New Jersey, about 45 minutes from New York by train.

Almost every professor I have worked with at Drew has taken my needs as a student into account and has gone out of their way to help me. On the other hand, the administration could be better. As well, the food is pretty awful and tuition is exorbitant, but that doesn't take away from the unique academic experience.

It is such a relaxing environment and you never get bored of looking at that view. Quinnipiac was a very convenient choice for me because I was planning on being a commuter and the campus is close to home. In my second year here, I can say with certainty that everyone here is so friendly and always willing to help you. The professors are amazing and they will do everything they can to make sure you are understanding the concepts and succeeding academically. Another interesting thing about Quinnipiac is that it has many clubs and organizations available. In this way, each student can definitely find something that matches their hobbies and interests. And lastly, I am glad I chose Quinnipiac because it offers such an interesting major, which is Behavioral Neuroscience.

With that being said the array of extracurricular activities available to students is fantastic. Greek life on this campus to me is one of the best in the country and one of the most wonderful organizations I've had the opportunity to be apart of. It not only provides an inclusiveness towards other organizations and the campus as a whole, but encourages students to work harder in both academia and community service. Along with Greek life this university has also provided many leadership opportunities that I wouldn't have had, had I gone somewhere else. While diversity on this campus tends to be lacking I was able to work with different multicultural organizations to change that aspect. All in all the University of Maine is a school worth attending if you have a specific plan.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2018-04-09T19:43:53.955304Z","guid":"d4139b76-2ad0-4055-baef-a319c6145b2f","rating":4},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":3}],"photos":{"default":{"crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/a4bf3efc1a87174e1309c2eb31a3ec49183286e3.jpg","MobileHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/c774187efe47ea9fb1599fc367c7d043324b3c9a.jpg"},"licenseName":"UNLICENSED"},"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-68.673839,44.895966,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-68.673839,44.895966,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.4721052631578946,"count":1900},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Orono, ME"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/university-of-maine/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"4ddcc361-a1f9-4bd6-b3ad-360f06549d5f","content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"Virginia Commonwealth University","type":"College","url":"virginia-commonwealth-university"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.8115},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":20544},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"980-1200"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Alum","body":"I attended VCU 2008-2012 and don't regret it at all! It is not a typical college campus with brick buildings and grassy fields. It's nestled in the city of Richmond where you have a diverse and dynamic mix of students, city dwellers, artists, and everything you can imagine! I would never trade this for another \"typical\" school. In terms of academics, everything is accessible through student tutoring sessions, group review sessions (highly advisable). It's challenging (especially if you do the Honors College), but worth your while. THe study abroad programs are EXCELLENT. I did 2 of them myself, and definitely recommend it-- they find a way to finance whatever study abroad you want to do, through their scholarship office. \nI only take 1 star away because I was a commuter and did not enjoy VCU as much as the residential students. However, the commute is also highly doable and there is a lot of parking available to students.

I am very impressed.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2018-02-22T05:22:57.949525Z","guid":"85e62768-e4f7-436b-9e27-538b12642f98","rating":5},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":3}],"photos":{"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-97.115087,32.728437,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-97.115087,32.728437,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.6343467543138868,"count":3651},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Arlington, TX"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/university-of-texas---arlington/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"43293596-4c14-48e8-89ff-e0968527d06a","content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"University of Massachusetts - Boston","type":"College","url":"university-of-massachusetts---boston"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.6852},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":11966},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"960-1180"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Senior","body":"UMass Boston is an awesome college! Great professors who want to help students learn new material and graduate. Fun activities to join such as groups to perform volunteer work, sports, school newspaper, and student government. Lot of new buildings are being built to expand the school. New buildings that are now open are real nice and up to date.  Not a party school.
