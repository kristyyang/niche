Even when I was doing my original college search, and NDMU came up, I could not help but continuously look at the schools website. I fell in love with it before I even applied. The professors here are trained to teach classes as large as 25 students, and even classes as small as 3 students. The academic curriculums are rigorous, however all professors here will go out of their way to help you succeed throughout your 4 years here. All are ensured by both students and faculty are welcomed; our motto is \"You Belong Here!\" To those looking to apply to any colleges this year, or even transferring, apply here.

It was a great, Goldilocks type campus that wasn't too small, or too big; but just right. It really made my college experience memorable to have such amazing professors that treated you like an individual. Even though it was memorable, it wasn't always in a good way. My Penn State GA advisor for my major gave me the wrong plan and I ended up having to go back an extra semester for one French III course that I didn't know I had to take. Penn State paid for me to go back, but because I was no longer considered a full-time student, my loans came due as soon as I received my degree. Not always the best choice, but definitely a good choice if you are staying near the Pittsburgh area and want a medium sized campus.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2018-05-30T16:09:10.824134Z","guid":"46f86b70-5bc9-4f00-a2df-52243f1573d2","rating":4},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":2.66}],"photos":{"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-79.827262,40.344474,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-79.827262,40.344474,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.3632075471698113,"count":212},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"McKeesport, PA"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/penn-state-greater-allegheny/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"5fa55757-834a-4b82-bf8d-4254c74304c6","content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"Calumet College of St. Joseph","type":"College","url":"calumet-college-of-st-joseph"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.337786},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":11346},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"780-940"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Niche User","body":"My experience at this school was great.

It was an amazing experience at the University because of the diversity of students, the campus beauty and the overall Downeast Maine atmosphere. Here I sit today going back to the University of Maine at Machias in my early 40's. I decided to change my major and return to school. I am an online student now, however I stay connected in various ways through the school. What I find the most appealing that even after all these years, the same professors are still working at the college. The school has a home like feel because of the atmosphere the campus offers. I highly recommend the University of Maine at Machias if you enjoy the outdoors, especially oceans. There may not be a lot of things to do in town because it is very rural. However, there is an abundance of outdoor activities that will be a once in a lifetime experience. Whether it exploring Jaspers Beach or The Bluff.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2017-05-23T16:50:39.013145Z","guid":"8d43d158-749c-432f-bdc9-f41d702f4fe8","rating":4},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":2.33}],"photos":{"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-67.456534,44.709895,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-67.456534,44.709895,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.2211538461538463,"count":104},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Machias, ME"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/university-of-maine-at-machias/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"26af2a28-12fc-4533-b7b5-b788e1765913","content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"University of the Southwest","type":"College","url":"university-of-the-southwest"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.6578},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":18063},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"742-970"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Alum","body":"I completed an online Master's degree in School Counseling with the U of Southwest.   I chose this program because I am living in Europe, and needed to find a program that didn't require me to be in a 'cyber' classroom during specific times of the day.  The professors were all very accessible and responsive and the coursework was interesting and well delivered.  Additionally, the registrar department was exceptionally helpful and kind.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2017-05-19T12:22:32.540845Z","guid":"4547f917-8f20-45a6-a0f8-c63066be59ba","rating":5},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":1.66}],"photos":{"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-103.186948,32.775496,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-103.186948,32.775496,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.7,"count":30},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Hobbs, NM"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/university-of-the-southwest/#scatterplot"}}]}
