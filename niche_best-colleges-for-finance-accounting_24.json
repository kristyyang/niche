Going to Oakwood was the best decision I could have made for my education. The campus is full of love, diversity, excitement, and Black Excellence. If I could change anything, I would suggest upgrading equipment and remodeling some of the older buildings. Overall I am very satisfied with my Oakwood Experience.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2017-07-28T16:47:35.379699Z","guid":"60794872-16eb-4164-a634-5d987d27c9ed","rating":5},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":2.33}],"photos":{"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-86.661628,34.756628,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-86.661628,34.756628,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.337404580152672,"count":1310},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Huntsville, AL"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/oakwood-university/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"7b2bdf6b-296d-4152-bd24-9edff6a97e73","content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"Huntingdon College","type":"College","url":"huntingdon-college"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.5676},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":21041},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"845-1050"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"College Freshman","body":"Huntingdon is the greatest college ever, and I love it so much!

I have been involved in so much and have gotten to connect with faculty and get to learn more and more about IU. We have a developed Campus life that gets all of the students engaged and out doing something fun. The advantage of a smaller university like Immaculata is that if you cannot find something here that you like or want to be involved in, you can create it and create a long lasting legacy at Immaculata.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2017-08-05T22:47:38.769621Z","guid":"7d638fb6-a766-4cd0-82f2-c9b6d92db942","rating":5},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":2.33}],"photos":{"default":{"crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/8b8a50b2482326200bb64551dbe583fa77366d7d.jpg","MobileHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/815667c724edcbe2b8923ef3d221a5eac8d8181e.jpg"},"licenseName":"UNLICENSED"},"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-75.57063,40.027963,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-75.57063,40.027963,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.5078740157480315,"count":254},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Immaculata, PA"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/immaculata-university/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"932ef223-8e6f-4518-b89d-4c2071b4b016","content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"Virginia State University","type":"College","url":"virginia-state-university"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.9448},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":15266},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"730-900"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Sophomore","body":"Transferring to Virginia State University has been a blessing. I have grown academically as well as mentally. Growing up in a small community, a place where opportunities are very limited to black males,  this university has been an eye opener to many possibilities in a great way. I've met many friends and the professors have been great in helping to make this truly a learning experience for me.  I am looking forward to my second semester as a Trojans!","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2017-12-29T02:15:57.872578Z","guid":"03860989-a4fd-4686-afd0-32ff05bbc81a","rating":5},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":2.33}],"photos":{"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-77.419886,37.236453,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-77.419886,37.236453,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.3756521739130436,"count":1150},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Petersburg, VA"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/virginia-state-university/#scatterplot"}}]}
