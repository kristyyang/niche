Also, the professors I have had so far are very well educated and care about student success. The cafeteria food is average and excellent at times. Winter drags on a little too long, but there are many things to do outdoors like skiing, ice-skating, or playing hockey. The summer season is exceptional and makes the winter weather worth it. The only advice I would give is to make the most out of the opportunities given and get involved.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2018-05-04T03:16:51.522787Z","guid":"e1cba19f-94ce-472e-9f59-61e1d49bd48d","rating":4},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":2.66}],"photos":{"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-68.588364,47.250306,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-68.588364,47.250306,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.5567010309278353,"count":97},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Fort Kent, ME"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/university-of-maine-at-fort-kent/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"111b04a0-e779-45f9-9053-b635424f6dc9","content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"Kentucky Wesleyan College","type":"College","url":"kentucky-wesleyan-college"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.5722},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":18265},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"870-1140"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Freshman","body":"I absolutely love attending Kentucky Wesleyan.
