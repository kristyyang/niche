There are tons of possibilities that one can get involved in at Penn State through clubs, community involvement, or sports.  As an engineer, I am very glad that I chose this particular school because our engineering department is one of the best in the United States, and the chances of finding a job upon graduation is quite high.  There is one particular thing that I would like to see change in the future at Penn State and that particular change is with academic scholarships for students.  Currently, Penn State only offers athletic scholarships at the main campus, and at branch campuses I was able to find out that they offer academic scholarships.  There are particular scholarships offered through individual colleges at main, but for someone is graduates in the top percentage of their class there should be some sort of scholarship given.  Overall, Penn State is a great school.

Given its high standards, the courses are also top notch. The campus life is also very lively. Faculty and Staff are very helpful to all the students and take special care of the students in need. The university is very diverse and accommodates for everyone. One of the best security feature they have are these emergency call booths where someone can press the emergency button and the campus police will be there under 90 seconds.

I began to wonder from my previous year of college whether or not college was for me. However, within hours of starting Clemson I began to realize that college here was going to be great.  My professors have embedded within me a love to read, and I have read more books that were not required by my classes, within my two years here, than I had in all of middle school and high school. Even though I did not focus on the social life at Clemson when I first started, I quickly was able to find friends from all backgrounds, some being from various clubs and fraternities, to those on the football team. College game day at Clemson is quite possibly the most exciting sports venue in the United States!

There's always something new to do and see and the academics are nothing to complain about. I'm a physics major and some of our professors are simply fantastic! The only academic complaint I have is the intro math courses: unnecessarily competitive and disorganized. Other than that, I've never had a class I didn't enjoy. The physics department is particularly impressive, except for its distinct lack of coffee (it's time: get a cafe in/near Loomis already).","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2018-04-29T05:27:03.992779Z","guid":"3d055a45-3d23-42f6-a4eb-65bda8f2a411","rating":4},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":4.33}],"photos":{"default":{"author":"vsmithuk","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/3bd07b7ad6f7539602b686c397574b5df9aedcbd.jpg","MobileHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/a3ceb931e74031ade74565eea2d1d30c9ee4e770.jpg","Thumbnail":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/0ec9783e6ecefa67c0081d4d083fbd2ec39cb2d8"},"licenseName":"CC BY ","licenseUrl":"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/2.0/","sourceUrl":"https://www.flickr.com/photos/vsmithuk/370812598/"},"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-88.230309,40.108864,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-88.230309,40.108864,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.68393536121673,"count":4208},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Champaign, IL"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/university-of-illinois-at-urbana-champaign/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"c76bd867-9b37-43fe-96ae-1279d5f3875f","badge":{"display":"Best Colleges for Architecture in America","ordinal":32,"total":116,"vanityURL":"best-colleges-for-architecture"},"content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"University of Cincinnati","type":"College","url":"university-of-cincinnati"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.7642},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":19978},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"1030-1290"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Alum","body":"The campus of the University is beautifully crafted and redesigned.

The amount of school spirit everyone has is unlike anything I've ever experienced and everyone truly is just so happy to be a buckeye. The challenging coursework and excellent professors make Ohio State's academic experience one of a kind.

I think NCSU has one of the best engineering and communication programs here on campus and they also have a lot of resources at our libraries and everywhere else on campus. Their database is incredible and the library has so much information for you to refer to when doing research or completing an essay.
