It’s not necessary to be Catholic and people who aren’t religious at all won’t feel excluded, but it is especially amazing for people who are religious. I myself am not very religious but was raised in the faith and do appreciate it, so I enjoyed being around it and taking the required Theology and Philosophy courses. Everyone is extremely nice and collaborative! Very smart people here and caring professors. Single sex dorms is a negative as well as less opportunities for medical professions, as there is no hospital or medical focus here. I would say it’s best for business, engineering, or liberal arts.

There's a good group of people striving for this, for Wheaton to be a welcoming home for all students, staff, and faculty, and for non-white/Western views to be taught in academics, etc, but that's not the reality yet.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2017-12-30T19:57:06.303423Z","guid":"d45345f3-a8f1-48ae-9d13-b9bcb390b355","rating":4},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":4}],"photos":{"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-88.09681,41.870943,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-88.09681,41.870943,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.884228187919463,"count":596},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Wheaton, IL"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/wheaton-college---illinois/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"a92b9859-b7d8-4bbf-a7e9-cfe0808c92f6","badge":{"display":"Best Colleges for Religious Studies in America","ordinal":9,"total":197,"vanityURL":"best-colleges-for-religious-studies"},"content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":true,"isPremium":false,"name":"Appalachian Bible College","type":"College","url":"appalachian-bible-college"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.5185},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":15728},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"870-973"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"College Freshman","body":"I have thoroughly enjoyed my experience at school so far.

I am part of a gap year program there called One Life, which I would absolutely recommend to a friend.  It has allowed me to travel to Israel, the Grand Canyon, and countless other places along with living in a community type environment and earning 30 college credits.  As for LBC it self, it is a smaller, Christian school in Lancaster, PA.   LBC is made up of like-minded individuals that are pursuing Christ.  In addition, although this campus is very small (with plenty of room to grow), every part of it is gorgeous.  And with Lancaster city close by, there are countless options to be entertained.  One change I hope LBC will make is to grow their campus.  Although their sports teams perform at a high level for a D3 school, they only have one basketball court that must be shared with other sports teams throughout the week.  They also should have a larger more weight-lifting facility.  Ultimately, I would recommend LBC/One Life to anyone searching for a college.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2018-03-17T15:52:50.231215Z","guid":"267e3e15-6d41-4c7c-9ca4-d3310d39b3ff","rating":4},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":3.33}],"photos":{"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-76.287781,40.074375,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-76.287781,40.074375,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":4.016326530612245,"count":245},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Lancaster, PA"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/lancaster-bible-college/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"d9c8ac5f-72f9-45e2-9ddb-88bc3655a2f6","badge":{"display":"Best Colleges for Religious Studies in America","ordinal":12,"total":197,"vanityURL":"best-colleges-for-religious-studies"},"content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"College of the Ozarks","type":"College","url":"college-of-the-ozarks"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.1422},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":13308},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"1025-1159"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Sophomore","body":"College of the Ozarks provides education with free tuition.

Each one of them made sure to let me know that for any reason I could set up a time to talk with them. I also thoroughly enjoyed the resources and information I received there. As a missionary kid, I wondered how much more I could learn about missions. This college has taught me a lot, not only about mission methodology, but even more importantly about my loving God behind it all. My college experience here was a great experience. Of course it is not a perfect place, only Heaven is perfect.

The University of Virginia is AMAZING. I have learned a great deal from each of my professors. (I recommend using ratemyprofessor and thecourseform to help you choose them). I actually enjoy going to classes that aren't based on regurgitating information but processing it and actually learning. Additionally, with thousands of clubs, there are plenty of ways to get involved. On another note, there are many stereotypes of people who come to the University, but I promise that not all of us are preppy, rich, and white, though a good portion is. The only problems I have with UVA are the prices of tuition and the honor code. Tuition is expensive and instead of giving grants UVA sometimes gives a lot of loans. Although I love the honor code and what it stands for, it seems to target minorities and foreign students.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2017-08-02T21:55:52.066083Z","guid":"75238c1f-3ce8-4b96-9994-7e4da15e8a23","rating":5},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":4.33}],"photos":{"default":{"author":"vironevaeh","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/488e5eac782b88e31489b688d27c0788a2e5194e.jpg","MobileHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/b344039af213c2a3140fb29177c3b67b8827e6e5.jpg","Thumbnail":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/2e460d21389ae370e4fd05a62e1c1ccbecdf6fd5"},"licenseName":"CC BY-SA","licenseUrl":"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/","sourceUrl":"https://www.flickr.com/photos/vironevaeh/5200391948/"},"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-78.502599,38.036546,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-78.502599,38.036546,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.8272023233301065,"count":2066},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Charlottesville, VA"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/university-of-virginia/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"0fb081a3-2ae2-40a5-abb1-c822f55164ee","badge":{"display":"Best Colleges for Religious Studies in America","ordinal":23,"total":197,"vanityURL":"best-colleges-for-religious-studies"},"content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"Oak Hills Christian College","type":"College","url":"oak-hills-christian-college"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.1636},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":19410},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"680-860"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Sophomore","body":"This is a truly amazing school.
