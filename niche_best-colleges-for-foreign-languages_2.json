Although the campus environment is not for everyone, I enjoyed my time there.\n\nProspective students should know that Greek Life, while not mandatory in any sense, is deep-rooted in our campus culture. That being said, there are plenty of groups and organizations for everyone to feel involved and welcomed somewhere. \n\nProfessors genuinely care about students as individuals and many will make efforts to get to know you. Office hours are abundant and the professors are always willing to go over difficult material with students. Class sizes vary from 5 -20 students with few exceptions.\n\nThere are 5 dining areas on campus: one main dining hall and four smaller \"cafes\".  The food is alright.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2018-06-06T12:33:28.829902Z","guid":"f2a482eb-2760-45ad-b8ce-aa567e3a3345","rating":4},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":4.33}],"photos":{"default":{"crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/afcc0daa287bad14bb66ed9fd5f6d1ecda83f4b6.jpg","MobileHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/ca1966a8c4b508224f640ce6b55980a70b7d2849.jpg","Thumbnail":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/558b332f7bb860a77e130213ee7a799b2a92fe54"},"licenseName":"UNLICENSED"},"mapbox_header":{"crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-79.4444,37.7869,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-79.4444,37.7869,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"UNLICENSED"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.9086294416243654,"count":394},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Lexington, VA"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/washington--and--lee-university/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"de47f4f1-92dd-4632-8a9f-986370be041a","badge":{"display":"Best Colleges in America","ordinal":23,"total":1644,"vanityURL":"best-colleges"},"content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"University of Michigan - Ann Arbor","type":"College","url":"university-of-michigan---ann-arbor"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.2859},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":16107},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"1310-1500"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Alum","body":"The University of Michigan's motto is \"Leaders and Best\" and that's exactly what this school provides and produces.

I myself am not very religious but was raised in the faith and do appreciate it, so I enjoyed being around it and taking the required Theology and Philosophy courses. Everyone is extremely nice and collaborative! Very smart people here and caring professors.

Professors are very engaged with their students and I can definitely see how passionate they are about the courses they teach. Class sizes are great as well, with several of my classes having fewer than 15 students and none over ~30. While diversity of the student population leaves something to be desired, Davidson is slowly improving.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2018-05-02T04:56:40.035205Z","guid":"a1640b05-25eb-482b-bc41-64af8fe060b1","rating":5},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":4.33}],"photos":{"mapbox_header":{"author":"Â© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-80.845236,35.500006,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-80.845236,35.500006,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"Â© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.8776978417266186,"count":278},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Davidson, NC"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/davidson-college/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"09e8cd9a-f401-4c8b-a79c-f02e10ac0201","badge":{"display":"Best Colleges in America","ordinal":42,"total":1644,"vanityURL":"best-colleges"},"content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"University of California - Berkeley","type":"College","url":"university-of-california---berkeley"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.1693},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":17160},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"1270-1540"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Sophomore","body":"Berkeley is just perfect balance between academics and fun!

The University of Virginia is AMAZING. I have learned a great deal from each of my professors. (I recommend using ratemyprofessor and thecourseform to help you choose them). I actually enjoy going to classes that aren't based on regurgitating information but processing it and actually learning. Additionally, with thousands of clubs, there are plenty of ways to get involved. On another note, there are many stereotypes of people who come to the University, but I promise that not all of us are preppy, rich, and white, though a good portion is. The only problems I have with UVA are the prices of tuition and the honor code. Tuition is expensive and instead of giving grants UVA sometimes gives a lot of loans. Although I love the honor code and what it stands for, it seems to target minorities and foreign students.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2017-08-02T21:55:52.066083Z","guid":"75238c1f-3ce8-4b96-9994-7e4da15e8a23","rating":5},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":4.33}],"photos":{"default":{"author":"vironevaeh","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/488e5eac782b88e31489b688d27c0788a2e5194e.jpg","MobileHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/b344039af213c2a3140fb29177c3b67b8827e6e5.jpg","Thumbnail":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/2e460d21389ae370e4fd05a62e1c1ccbecdf6fd5"},"licenseName":"CC BY-SA","licenseUrl":"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/","sourceUrl":"https://www.flickr.com/photos/vironevaeh/5200391948/"},"mapbox_header":{"author":"Â© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-78.502599,38.036546,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-78.502599,38.036546,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"Â© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.8272023233301065,"count":2066},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Charlottesville, VA"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/university-of-virginia/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"d8a17c0f-cc25-4d2a-b231-0303ea016427","badge":{"display":"Best Colleges in America","ordinal":29,"total":1644,"vanityURL":"best-colleges"},"content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":true,"isPremium":true,"name":"Carnegie Mellon University","type":"College","url":"carnegie-mellon-university"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.2171},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":35250},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"1380-1550"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Alum","body":"Carnegie Mellon is tough, no doubt about it.
