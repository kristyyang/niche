Everyone was very helpful and caring. All of my questions were answered and I am in love with the school. The location is perfect with having a urban lifestyle with suburban people. The campus is located only 1 mile away from Lake Michigan for summer fun and there are also numerous activities that can be done during the summer months, such as going to their D1 basketball team. Everyone has great school spirit and safety is tremendous since they have an almost 24 hour limo service that will ensure that you make it back to your dorm after a cheer-filled game or long night of studying in their wonderful library.    I recommend everyone looking into this college when they are applying.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2018-01-01T19:42:26.362584Z","guid":"9c3f07e7-6513-490c-b660-968f4077529f","rating":5},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":4}],"photos":{"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-87.928121,43.038766,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-87.928121,43.038766,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.5583377730420884,"count":1877},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Milwaukee, WI"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/marquette-university/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"8d0039f7-2dd7-4510-9b5a-4f801b88a4e9","badge":{"display":"Best Colleges for Nursing in America","ordinal":53,"total":580,"vanityURL":"best-colleges-for-nursing"},"content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":true,"isPremium":false,"name":"Florida State University","type":"College","url":"florida-state-university"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.5801},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":16506},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"1110-1280"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Alum","body":"I received a high quality education at FSU.

The courses are time consuming and require one to put in effort, however, that is to be expected.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2018-02-26T17:11:03.574724Z","guid":"5c1d81d1-44b2-4f9d-9a47-d54c82edea0e","rating":5},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":4}],"photos":{"default":{"author":"australianshepherds","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/0a7353227b597d0237ebba5ffa47cfc57bc75ef0.jpg","MobileHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/bbcae5c41985e4040071cb88e4d68e4954091cb9.jpg","Thumbnail":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/1c809b30dab4ec34e87a06bcca0a324041dd06b6"},"licenseName":"CC BY-SA","licenseUrl":"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/","sourceUrl":"https://www.flickr.com/photos/australianshepherds/4515942319/"},"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-85.492409,32.600201,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-85.492409,32.600201,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.8747056052755533,"count":2123},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Auburn, AL"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/auburn-university/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"ac9cfdaf-b7c0-44c8-931b-af5caa160f52","badge":{"display":"Best Colleges for Nursing in America","ordinal":59,"total":580,"vanityURL":"best-colleges-for-nursing"},"content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"Texas A&M University","type":"College","url":"texas-a-and-m-university"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.6717},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":15455},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"1070-1310"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Senior","body":"This is a large school, however it feels small.

While the Diocese of Scranton retained ownership of the University, it was administered by the Lasallian Christian Brothers from 1888 to 1942.[4] In 1942, the Society of Jesus took ownership and control of the University.[5] During the 1960s, the University became an independent institution under a lay Board of Trustees.

Professors have extremely high expectations for their students, however they do everything in their power to build your way to those high expectations. It can be difficult to find a study/social life balance. If you cannot develop strong study habits, classes will be a struggle. There are a ton of resources available to students who haven't established study habits and professors are happy to work with students. The open-door policy is an awesome thing to take advantage of.

The MSC is a great student hub with a good food court, a restaurant, 4 floors of study or “chilling” areas, offices, event rooms, a theater, a ballroom, a pharmacy, a computer store and many more things. The library has resources from state of the art equipment, macs and PCs, digital media equipment with green screens, quiet study floors, a Starbucks, tutoring center, a writing center and so many more things. Central campus is very pretty and very green, with the MLK plaza in the middle and trees perfectly lined up.

I lived on campus for one year and now I commute from my home in Northern NJ. Since my first major is Education of the Deaf and Hard of Hearing and my second Psychology, I have mainly spent my time in the Education Building and the Social Sciences Building. The professors here are incredibly intelligent and love to get to know the students as more than just a number. This is mainly due to the small class sizes, which I believe is one of the benefits of this institution. The professors are willing to work with you outside of class because they truly value your understanding of the subjects. I am continuously motivated to become a future educator by the professors that I have had and I can't wait to continue on in this career. I always feel safe when I am on campus and although the food isn't amazing, it is much better than other colleges that I have visited!

This takes up a lot of time, credits, and money for classes that may not be applicable for some people.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2018-04-29T04:23:56.021839Z","guid":"4c57ecad-4c36-4934-b114-27ec65ed93db","rating":4},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":3.66}],"photos":{"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-122.362923,47.649338,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-122.362923,47.649338,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.67816091954023,"count":957},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Seattle, WA"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/seattle-pacific-university/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"281a6b63-fdca-42bc-819d-f4e6502dd62d","badge":{"display":"Best Colleges for Nursing in America","ordinal":73,"total":580,"vanityURL":"best-colleges-for-nursing"},"content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"University of Massachusetts - Amherst","type":"College","url":"university-of-massachusetts---amherst"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.5968},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":20093},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"1130-1330"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Alum","body":"Umass Amherst is located in a spectacular location shared by several other amazing colleges. As the flagship campus of the Umass system, it stands as a growing research institution for all of STEM as well as the liberal arts. Along with the amazing faculty in my department the microbiology curriculum is in my opinion one of the best in New England. As an active member of the student body, I never felt like I was alone on campus and was able to be myself on campus. I enjoyed 4+ years at the university and I will always look back fondly on both the memories and friendships I have made while I was a Minute Man.

Great professors and challenging classes foster a pretty positive environment for learning. Interim classes may seem like a waste of time, but pick something that interests you and you'll be surprised. Don't slack, work hard, and you'll be fine. Dorm housing is nothing to complain about, being so close to academic buildings. There are solid people at Calvin, but it takes a while to figure social out. If you're not from the area, Dutch, 6\"2, or wear shorts in winter, it may be a little jarring, but there are great people out there. This is college, not high school, you don't need to impress anyone. Most kids grew up in the area all their lives and have known each other forever, so it certainly is a bubble. If you're from out of the country and are used to nightlife, it's painful to watch. Overall, Calvin's a good place that gives you space to develop as a person. Students listen and learn from each other, regardless of opinion.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2018-06-04T10:55:00.15119Z","guid":"af267447-0e53-4cfa-b9f9-113f0decde18","rating":4},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":4}],"photos":{"default":{"crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/100046d6ab5817509ba9ac3135f7d0337810d550.jpg","MobileHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/1b1dd584208ff1a34d63821ab2e269e780a5e0c4.jpg"},"licenseName":"UNLICENSED"},"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-85.587548,42.929916,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-85.587548,42.929916,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.8747044917257685,"count":846},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Grand Rapids, MI"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/calvin-college/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"4662e8d2-30af-481f-b32d-bde25f1108f8","badge":{"display":"Best Colleges for Nursing in America","ordinal":75,"total":580,"vanityURL":"best-colleges-for-nursing"},"content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":true,"isPremium":false,"name":"University of Texas - Arlington","type":"College","url":"university-of-texas---arlington"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.6982},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":11952},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"950-1190"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Sophomore","body":"I am a single mother of 2 girls (9&7) and I am finally finishing my degree in want I want to do.

The professors are incredible and care about the students more than they care about their academic journals and whatever else professors do. They will work with you, help you, and do absolutely everything in their power to make sure you succeed. \nThe quality of education is also amazing. I've learned so much and I am actually enjoying it. Many Christian schools tend to sacrifice quality of education for making everything \"christian\", Cedarville does not do this. At Cedarville they take education seriously and teach at a high academic level.\nOver all, Cedarville is an excellent school and a great choice.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2017-12-28T19:25:28.707719Z","guid":"b62ad6e7-5668-4b9e-b726-a8dc8d8ad8d0","rating":4},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":3.33}],"photos":{"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-83.812098,39.750338,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-83.812098,39.750338,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.8205882352941174,"count":1020},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Cedarville, OH"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/cedarville-university/#scatterplot"}}]}
