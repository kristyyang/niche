The reason being the teachers let you know what their office hours are and if you aren't able to get into those times they will schedule appointments with you.

Not as corny as it sounds.  You know people in major/outside.  News flow isn't always the best. If you bond with teachers and professors easily, you will always have the upper hand.  Professors care and work with you.  Many repeatedly encourage students to visit offices.  Very open. Running trail by cornfields,  wetlands to explore, two lakes, a cemetery, woods, and school is only 2-10 minutes from Walmart/The Mall/etc (Many job opps aside from work study).  Mass held in the basilica on Sunday. Professors are also VERY FRIENDLY monks that live on campus.  Don't feel pressured if not religious, no requirements.\n\nMiscellaneous:\nAthletics huge here.  Will pass several official/intramural teams daily.\nTuition reduced a lot.  Listed price is falsely high.\nSafe.  Quiet/calm weekends.\nHousing OKAY.  Really depends.\nGood food.  Can be repetitive though.  Many vegetarian options.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2017-04-22T12:23:20.697812Z","guid":"57431fe0-f590-4b92-917e-a965fa7669ba","rating":4},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":3}],"photos":{"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-79.403702,40.29252,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-79.403702,40.29252,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.4795081967213113,"count":488},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Latrobe, PA"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/saint-vincent-college---pennsylvania/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"37968f58-1749-4a66-b912-81cd6f3d38de","content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"Lancaster Bible College","type":"College","url":"lancaster-bible-college"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.6739},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":19732},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"900-1120"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Freshman","body":"LBC is a great school!  I am part of a gap year program there called One Life, which I would absolutely recommend to a friend.  It has allowed me to travel to Israel, the Grand Canyon, and countless other places along with living in a community type environment and earning 30 college credits.  As for LBC it self, it is a smaller, Christian school in Lancaster, PA.   LBC is made up of like-minded individuals that are pursuing Christ.  In addition, although this campus is very small (with plenty of room to grow), every part of it is gorgeous.  And with Lancaster city close by, there are countless options to be entertained.  One change I hope LBC will make is to grow their campus.  Although their sports teams perform at a high level for a D3 school, they only have one basketball court that must be shared with other sports teams throughout the week.  They also should have a larger more weight-lifting facility.  Ultimately, I would recommend LBC/One Life to anyone searching for a college.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2018-03-17T15:52:50.231215Z","guid":"267e3e15-6d41-4c7c-9ca4-d3310d39b3ff","rating":4},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":3.33}],"photos":{"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-76.287781,40.074375,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-76.287781,40.074375,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":4.016326530612245,"count":245},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Lancaster, PA"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/lancaster-bible-college/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"8fb82592-8c2c-43f3-a7eb-29958d1320ed","content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"Lenoir-Rhyne University","type":"College","url":"lenoir-rhyne-university"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.7011},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":18291},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"870-1090"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Freshman","body":"I love the small classroom sizes and the one on one help that you are able to receive from the professors.

I have sooo many spooky experiences :) best food spots drunk or sober are Burrito Truck, First Wok, Donnie’s & University Dogs.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2018-05-03T03:08:56.228022Z","guid":"4ab869f8-d239-4976-9a29-e5e9502bdcac","rating":5},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":2.66}],"photos":{"default":{"crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/9c685a9c11b680024ad87ce30e6bca36f3f814b1.jpg","MobileHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/7c4cd65515a1aa6b0c2b86d5e87c64df1be75c7b.jpg"},"licenseName":"UNLICENSED"},"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-88.974571,39.842604,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-88.974571,39.842604,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.431654676258993,"count":556},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Decatur, IL"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/millikin-university/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"feb8814f-9ea8-4eb1-a17c-05cc7f167b53","content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"Berea College","type":"College","url":"berea-college"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.328},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":2862},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"1000-1220"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Sophomore","body":"There has been a lot of opportunities come to me just from being college.

I am so blessed by this and encouraged by these talented people every day to improve at the piano and singing.  I suppose one thing that I would like to see change here at Berea is everyone taking advantage of what they have.

UMSL has opportunities for developing leadership, networking, mentoring and team concepts that can put you on a path to achieve your educational goal.

It is a beautiful school on a gorgeous mountain in rural Emmitsburg, MD. The small student to professor ratio gives each student the opportunity to personally get to know each professor and to build a professional, but personal relationship with each faculty and staff member. The other students and members of the Mount community including coaches, priests, seminarians, and alumni are very involved in the school and try to make the students feel a part of a larger community. I have enjoyed each moment at the Mount because it has become my home away from home! Seriously, I call it home even when I am away from it! If I had to go through the college selection process again, I would still choose the Mount. Even though it is an older school in a country area, the people have made my three years at the Mount feel like I am in the city on a new campus. The community definitely sets the Mount apart from the many schools I toured.

It is not a typical college campus with brick buildings and grassy fields. It's nestled in the city of Richmond where you have a diverse and dynamic mix of students, city dwellers, artists, and everything you can imagine! I would never trade this for another \"typical\" school. In terms of academics, everything is accessible through student tutoring sessions, group review sessions (highly advisable). It's challenging (especially if you do the Honors College), but worth your while. THe study abroad programs are EXCELLENT. I did 2 of them myself, and definitely recommend it-- they find a way to finance whatever study abroad you want to do, through their scholarship office. \nI only take 1 star away because I was a commuter and did not enjoy VCU as much as the residential students. However, the commute is also highly doable and there is a lot of parking available to students.

I wish they would try to improve the parking situation.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2017-11-13T17:41:05.018366Z","guid":"156c3021-d415-4036-ab77-f84eb42216d5","rating":4},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":3}],"photos":{"default":{"crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/f76f37b2c77cbc3d8316f04445c1b74e634818d0.jpg","MobileHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/2fee799f116d7a4b2367eacb9adc16cecd92c6c3.jpg"},"licenseName":"UNLICENSED"},"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-92.105738,46.81544,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-92.105738,46.81544,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.6693548387096775,"count":496},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Duluth, MN"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/the-college-of-st-scholastica/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"575e5f44-4b3a-4be0-b327-ab8a18ab48c5","content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":true,"isPremium":false,"name":"Howard University","type":"College","url":"howard-university"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.3},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":22712},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"1040-1240"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Freshman","body":"I am a freshman at Howard University. I love it so much. It has already taught me so much not only in the classroom, but outside of the classroom as well.I love the surrounding DC environment because it offers diversity and fun. I love my on campus dorm and it is close to my classes. Howard University is a place you come to grow and gain knowledge on who you are and find who you want to be. I would recommend this school to everyone and anyone if I could! It is like a big family. The networking oppurtunities are endless. I love the culture because it is very rich and diverse. I am always meeting new people from so many places around the world. I have had good experiences thus far with all of my professors. I can tell they really want me to succeed and be the best that I can. Often, my parents ask me if I made the right decision. I am absolutely sure that I did and I could not be happier to have chosen to attend Howard University.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2018-01-04T23:35:01.904982Z","guid":"f10182e7-25e8-4ab9-b6e1-755380fabb28","rating":5},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":3.33}],"photos":{"default":{"crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/7633545e449854b939174fafc89bf538b3ced8ce.jpg","MobileHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/48d8510e8210ca6e286bee501be568a49f82533e.jpg"},"licenseName":"UNLICENSED"},"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-77.019478,38.920739,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-77.019478,38.920739,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.3921120320091456,"count":3499},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Washington, DC"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/howard-university/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"f4eda9c6-285a-4f42-83ea-11485a82197e","content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"Central Connecticut State University","type":"College","url":"central-connecticut-state-university"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.6001},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":14852},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"900-1100"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Alum","body":"I attended Central Connecticut State University (CCSU) for two and a half years. During this time, I acquired my Bachelor of Arts in Social Work while receiving a  minor in Psychological Science. One thing I noticed while enrolled at the university is that the teachers were very proactive in ensuring the best learning environment for their students. I found that the professors made themselves available to students who needed extra time outside of classroom time to process materials being taught in class. As a young African American Woman, I was further impressed by not only the diversity of the university's  faculty but also their students. Overall, my experience at CCSU was positive. The only thing I would change is for the university to be as considerate to traditional students as they are to non-traditional students as it relates to class availablity.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2018-02-02T15:20:29.113994Z","guid":"ec08d80e-79bf-40e3-b696-0782ce36de86","rating":4},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":2.66}],"photos":{"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-72.770094,41.690258,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-72.770094,41.690258,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.3884156729131174,"count":1174},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"New Britain, CT"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/central-connecticut-state-university/#scatterplot"}}]}
