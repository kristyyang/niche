I will be an incoming freshman this fall and while I was at orientation I noticed a lot of awesome things. First off, the professors and faculty members at Hofstra are there to make sure you're at your best 24/7. There's so many places to go to receive help, it's very reassuring especially when you're having a bad day. Next, the campus and the dorms are nice. The campus is very large which means a lot of walking, but it's not that bad because there's such beautiful architecture and landscaping to look at. The dorms are small and neat, but there's air conditioning which is a major plus. I got to sit through a real college class, which at Hofstra are relatively small. The food at Hofstra has a pretty good selection, but nothing crazy. There are Starbucks, Dunkin Donuts, Subways, Sbarros, and many other places to grab a bite to eat. Overall, Hofstra has a lot to offer and I couldn't be more excited to start my 4-year journey there!","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2017-08-17T13:19:43.218362Z","guid":"0f59bdeb-af97-4200-988e-1f0722fbf2d9","rating":4},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":3.33}],"photos":{"default":{"crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/2fb77d3e7ebcda2dfc09ad08572622874a2ade97.jpg","MobileHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/667677aae7cb8cd43b8b8fa8cb1993cc9e04e87a.jpg"},"licenseName":"UNLICENSED"},"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-73.60078,40.715959,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-73.60078,40.715959,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.483424047501237,"count":2021},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Hempstead, NY"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/hofstra-university/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"7142f38c-9d62-4173-9c4d-dc2da081a40f","badge":{"display":"Best Colleges for Business in America","ordinal":214,"total":1020,"vanityURL":"best-colleges-for-business"},"content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"Fresno Pacific University","type":"College","url":"fresno-pacific-university"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.6848},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":18245},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"850-1060"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Junior","body":"I love the community and atmosphere on the main campus. You get to meet really amazing professors and classmates. The classes offered here are enriching and the professors really care about you succeeding. The school is founded on Christ and is affiliated with the Mennonite sect of Protestantism. You do not have to be a Christian to attend this university as there is no statement of faith paper which needs to be documented. They are welcoming of all backgrounds and beliefs. Our athletics are also amazing. I especially like the swimming & diving and volleyball team. They are both so fun to cheer on! We are located close to downtown Fresno so my friends often go coffee shop hopping on the weekends. The school may be small, but we make up for it with big smiles and big hearts.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2018-01-11T07:12:34.493827Z","guid":"7ceefec2-e3fd-4c72-b4c1-f0c69c370214","rating":4},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":3.33}],"photos":{"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-119.731953,36.725279,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-119.731953,36.725279,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.8340336134453783,"count":476},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Fresno, CA"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/fresno-pacific-university/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"245d037c-95fa-4a57-8c8c-c061cf791e92","badge":{"display":"Best Colleges for Business in America","ordinal":215,"total":1020,"vanityURL":"best-colleges-for-business"},"content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"Georgia Southern University","type":"College","url":"georgia-southern-university"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.6455},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":16121},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"1030-1190"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Junior","body":"Georgia Southern is a great school!

My greatest disappointment with ACU lies with its recently announced policy regarding LGBT student employees as its discriminating and distasteful rhetoric doesn't reflect the actual opinion of the campus population (my engagement with professors, staff, and students and observance of the collective outrage over the policy has confirmed as much for me). As an LGBT student who had an active role in multiple campus positions, it was greatly disappointing to learn the administration's recent decision. I hope that they will revoke this discriminating change, as the community here is really accepting and loving.

My favorite part about being a bobcat is the energy associated walking through TXST’s campus, someone is always giving out free food (always accept free food in college), people play music, programs are out in the Quad doing activities at times and the overall feeling from being a student here at Texas State is powerful. If I could restart from my freshman year, I wouldn’t change a thing. Becoming a bobcat at Texas State University was the best decision I’ve ever made, and I am grateful for my high level of education.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2018-02-01T02:28:09.441055Z","guid":"095031b9-5176-4791-a118-c0282146277c","rating":5},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":3.33}],"photos":{"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-97.936392,29.889202,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-97.936392,29.889202,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.7317608337904553,"count":5469},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"San Marcos, TX"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/texas-state-university/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"076d6457-e542-40e7-a649-71d8aad57f34","badge":{"display":"Best Colleges for Business in America","ordinal":227,"total":1020,"vanityURL":"best-colleges-for-business"},"content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"Whitworth University","type":"College","url":"whitworth-university"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.8857},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":27826},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"1000-1260"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"College Sophomore","body":"I have really enjoyed my experience at Whitworth so far! As a freshman, Whitworth was really great with helping me adapt to the big changes that come with college. Specifically at Whitworth, I have really enjoyed the traditiation for freshmen and all the events that it contained. I really enjoyed the events on campus during weekends. I wish the price could be cheaper so that it was easier to enjoy such a great education at Whitworth. I have met great friends who would probably answer the same as me. Another improvement I think Whitworth could make is making sure that students are able to understand how to get a job once they have finished college. This might be an improvement with the advisers but I think students need help with stress and knowing we can find stable careers out of college that correspond with our majors.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2016-07-13T23:12:11Z","guid":"d41405c1-67df-4aea-88ec-c750f90fc98d","rating":4},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":3.66}],"photos":{"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-117.418078,47.753699,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-117.418078,47.753699,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.9413145539906105,"count":852},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Spokane, WA"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/whitworth-university/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"1c9182d2-2d4a-4181-8e42-19f15cb46ea3","badge":{"display":"Best Colleges for Business in America","ordinal":228,"total":1020,"vanityURL":"best-colleges-for-business"},"content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"University of St. Thomas - Texas","type":"College","url":"university-of-st-thomas---texas"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.7739},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":21517},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"990-1175"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Freshman","body":"This university is actually pretty awesome.

The fact that it's a small school (which means small class sizes) makes it very easy to develop a close relationship with your professors! The classes are all academically demanding, so as long as you try and do your work, you should be fine! Student life is pretty good as the RA's and CA's, as well as the clubs and organizations around school, come up with some fun events and activities that everyone can enjoy! It honestly is very easy to make friends, especially if you live in the dorms. UST offers some great academic programs and they are very generous when awarding scholarships. Overall, the University of St. Thomas is a great school.

Great professors and challenging classes foster a pretty positive environment for learning. Interim classes may seem like a waste of time, but pick something that interests you and you'll be surprised. Don't slack, work hard, and you'll be fine. Dorm housing is nothing to complain about, being so close to academic buildings. There are solid people at Calvin, but it takes a while to figure social out. If you're not from the area, Dutch, 6\"2, or wear shorts in winter, it may be a little jarring, but there are great people out there. This is college, not high school, you don't need to impress anyone. Most kids grew up in the area all their lives and have known each other forever, so it certainly is a bubble. If you're from out of the country and are used to nightlife, it's painful to watch. Overall, Calvin's a good place that gives you space to develop as a person. Students listen and learn from each other, regardless of opinion.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2018-06-04T10:55:00.15119Z","guid":"af267447-0e53-4cfa-b9f9-113f0decde18","rating":4},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":4}],"photos":{"default":{"crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/100046d6ab5817509ba9ac3135f7d0337810d550.jpg","MobileHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/1b1dd584208ff1a34d63821ab2e269e780a5e0c4.jpg"},"licenseName":"UNLICENSED"},"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-85.587548,42.929916,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-85.587548,42.929916,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.8747044917257685,"count":846},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Grand Rapids, MI"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/calvin-college/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"3e3b4110-0c43-4d56-b5f9-6c060dc07841","badge":{"display":"Best Colleges for Business in America","ordinal":235,"total":1020,"vanityURL":"best-colleges-for-business"},"content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"University of North Florida","type":"College","url":"university-of-north-florida"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.6453},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":13484},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"1040-1220"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Alum","body":"I am now a graduate of UNF with a B.S. in Biology.

Most of my peers who are more than qualified for positions are still struggling to find jobs.\n\nMy experiences in the biology department were overall very good, though I would like to see more variety of classes offered, and more internship options. The teachers were great and some of the courses were challenging (genetics, physiology). Do not wait until your last 2 semesters to find a senior seminar project and take genetics/physiology!

You make good friends that you most likely will have multiple classes with so it makes it easier to study and makes class more fun. The teachers have a lot of knowledge and are very receptive to feedback. Campus is beautiful and really well taken care of! The only down fall is that since they are a Christian school you are required to take quite a few in depth theology classes, regardless of your major. This takes up a lot of time, credits, and money for classes that may not be applicable for some people.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2018-04-29T04:23:56.021839Z","guid":"4c57ecad-4c36-4934-b114-27ec65ed93db","rating":4},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":3.66}],"photos":{"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-122.362923,47.649338,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-122.362923,47.649338,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.67816091954023,"count":957},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Seattle, WA"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/seattle-pacific-university/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"737ac7f1-8cb2-497b-957b-fbb2ff7d6941","badge":{"display":"Best Colleges for Business in America","ordinal":238,"total":1020,"vanityURL":"best-colleges-for-business"},"content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"Baldwin Wallace University","type":"College","url":"baldwin-wallace-university"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.5973},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":22326},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"950-1200"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Sophomore","body":"BW is great!

The counselors are unworkable, slow, and useless. Nevertheless, the school and education itself are very good. In addition, I have enjoyed the student body at USU.
