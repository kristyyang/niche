The professors are very engaging and willing to help their students. Furthermore, USU’s campus and the city of Logan are both amazing. I am very grateful for the opportunity I have had to go to school here. My only complaint is this: the counseling office at the business school is deplorable. The counselors are unworkable, slow, and useless. Nevertheless, the school and education itself are very good. In addition, I have enjoyed the student body at USU. They are humble, hardworking, and fun. Overall, I give Utah State University a four-star rating. They provide a great education for a reasonable price.

The professors here are okay, the reason why is they are very close-minded and authoritative. You cannot question their judgment, and they are not open to new ideas. The campus buildings and dorms are kept clean and updated - which is a huge plus to recompense their weaknesses. The student life here is dull since most people are commuters and the students only hang around with people from their high school. The food here is from good to average in some days. Finally, the academics here is excellent since it has tons of academic variations along with professors that are passionate about their specialized field. All in all, it is a great university!","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2018-02-15T08:51:05.921577Z","guid":"f40471ec-bf6b-4505-8722-41ae61551a3b","rating":4},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":3}],"photos":{"default":{"crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/5e2e951c3244d7c28ea08295d241080c6aa40fcb.jpg","MobileHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/801ab8e3233e1b781a4f8acbe3cadbb9a0302269.jpg"},"licenseName":"UNLICENSED"},"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-74.199455,40.859233,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-74.199455,40.859233,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.463615903975994,"count":2666},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Montclair, NJ"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/montclair-state-university/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"e1611688-b9f6-4721-abb2-36e6fc6b31f3","badge":{"display":"Best Colleges in America","ordinal":727,"total":1644,"vanityURL":"best-colleges"},"content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"Arkansas Tech University","type":"College","url":"arkansas-tech-university"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.6391},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":10887},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"850-1210"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Senior","body":"My experience at Arkansas Tech University has been great!  I love the flexibility of scheduling class times and days, and the help available for students to succeed. One thing that needs to change desperately is the parking available to students. I do not think that students should only be allowed to park in certain colored parking lots. It is a huge hassle to try and find a parking spot and get to class on time.

Going to Northern Michigan University has not been a big change in venue and that! I love the setup of the campus, everything is very easy to locate and everything is in walking distance from the residence halls. I also enjoy how incoming freshman are able o have cars on campus, it's a big help to be able to get home more often. There are a few things that Northern Michigan University could improve on. The parking situation is one of them, although they have added multiple lots to help the problem. Another item that could be better is the dining areas. They could have more of a selection of food throughout the week, which they are also changing for the Fall semester of 2018!","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2018-02-27T18:40:46.249035Z","guid":"f0a072ca-b35a-4bf0-8876-8d38f248e77d","rating":5},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":2.66}],"photos":{"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-87.403857,46.558037,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-87.403857,46.558037,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.5866099893730072,"count":941},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Marquette, MI"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/northern-michigan-university/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"9a59f82f-2bd2-456f-8826-09b3a98f36e9","content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"Lincoln College","type":"College","url":"lincoln-college"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.6202},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":16123},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"610-810"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Sophomore","body":"I am a returning student enrolled in Lincoln College & my experience there has been great.The professors there are phenomenal they are willing to give you one on one help, well organized,& are always reasonable with students and other professors.

Living on campus teaches you how to be a responsible young adult you have the chance to learn from mistakes & make your own decisions.Lincoln being a private, independent liberal arts college still have provided students with all type of activities and sports that you can get involved in.We have a variety of foods that is serves for breakfast, lunch & dinner.
