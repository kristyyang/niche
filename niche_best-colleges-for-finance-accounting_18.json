Queens is a very small campus, it'll take you 5 minutes to walk to the farthest part on campus! The student body closely resembles that of the size of a high school (2,500-3,000) students. Queens is also a liberal arts school so here we focus a lot on the arts and you are required to take some arts courses because of this, but I loved it; it broadened my knowledge and forced me to take courses that I may not have taken otherwise. Because of the size of the school the ratio of professor to student is along the lines of 1:17, which is great because you are NOT known as just a number here, you are an individual that the Professor actually gets to know. It makes your experience better when you know that your Professor cares about you.

MVNU is a very small, community based university so therefore it is easy to get to know someone fast and there is a lot of support for someone to be there. Academically, MVNU challenged me in ways my high school education could not and it has transformed me into a smarter and quicker learner, writer, speaker, and thinker. MVNU also has taught me over 1 semester how to be self-reliant and independent as an adult which is a great lesson to have in life. They do not call this school \"life-changing\" for nothing!","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2017-01-07T17:48:45.179887Z","guid":"9366d097-59da-441d-8a48-8a16adf17d79","rating":4},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":2.66}],"photos":{"default":{"crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/5b8d7340e92939cd80d02757b8f373be508d97a1.jpg","MobileHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/cdc1f40d90fc04f0f81c6840c3e847ff91d20d9f.jpg"},"licenseName":"UNLICENSED"},"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-82.474667,40.373859,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-82.474667,40.373859,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.4989939637826963,"count":497},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Mount Vernon, OH"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/mount-vernon-nazarene-university/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"494080af-2923-49c9-8c0e-358df4dbbf91","content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"Eastern Washington University","type":"College","url":"eastern-washington-university"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.9548},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":12397},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"850-1080"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Junior","body":"Eastern Washington University is a great place to go to school.

I have yet to take a class with a professor who does not know my name within the first two weeks of school. The class sizes are small, anywhere from 5-35 students, which allows for a very personalized classroom experience. You are not just a \"number\" to your professor like you would be at a bigger school, and this leads you to have great relationships with your professors and peers alike. \nIn addition, this college has truly allowed me to broaden my horizons more than I ever thought possible. When I came here, I was incredibly shy, but my professors and peers encouraged me to step out of my comfort zone. This led me to join various organizations, take challenging classes, and even go to London for a study abroad trip. \nThis school is amazing and has offered me endless opportunities.
