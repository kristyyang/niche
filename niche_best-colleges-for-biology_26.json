Classes are relatively small, perhaps 25 maximum for a general education course or something else that's popular, but it's not unusual to have only 6 or seven in more major-specific elective-type courses. This allows you to be very friendly with fellow classmates and faculty, and really be able to understand what needs to be done and exactly how to do it, or at least have the option of quickly approaching your professors. It's located in a charming little town, but also close enough to both Scott Air Force Base and St. Louis to fulfill most needs. My only qualm is the old science building, because it needs some better desks (and it's only that particular building). Also may-or-may not be haunted.\n\nGood for people who want a relatively quiet place where you can still interact with plenty of people but can actually get your work done and learn something worthwhile.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2017-05-05T17:14:14.465182Z","guid":"092199f4-bf7a-4863-80d5-bb9931ee8852","rating":4},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":3}],"photos":{"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-89.814486,38.609431,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-89.814486,38.609431,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.4759725400457664,"count":437},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Lebanon, IL"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/mckendree-university/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"119238de-0271-4787-b006-302adc76827c","content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"West Chester University of Pennsylvania","type":"College","url":"west-chester-university-of-pennsylvania"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.6448},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":18651},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"970-1150"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Freshman","body":"I love the atmosphere of both West Chester University and the town!

The campus is really pretty and has been updated in a lot of ways--there is a caribou coffee and snack shop in the library (the library is beautiful, spacious, and bright btw!), they have added another newer coffee shop in Somsen Hall as well.  Yes like all colleges there are a lot of old buildings, but they have charm and history.  The Wellness Center is amazing--relatively updated and very modern looking.    The food court has also been remodeled and looks great as well.  Overall, I had a great time at the school--true, the city of Winona is a little bland, there is the typical movie theater and a couple restaurants that aren't chains, but its a small town.  Typically, people can travel to La Crosse or Rochester for the nearest mall or other adventures.  Honestly though, Winona State is beautiful and a pretty great school.

It is a beautiful school on a gorgeous mountain in rural Emmitsburg, MD. The small student to professor ratio gives each student the opportunity to personally get to know each professor and to build a professional, but personal relationship with each faculty and staff member. The other students and members of the Mount community including coaches, priests, seminarians, and alumni are very involved in the school and try to make the students feel a part of a larger community. I have enjoyed each moment at the Mount because it has become my home away from home! Seriously, I call it home even when I am away from it! If I had to go through the college selection process again, I would still choose the Mount. Even though it is an older school in a country area, the people have made my three years at the Mount feel like I am in the city on a new campus.

Responsibility is delegated through cadet officers, and NCOs and most importantly students are given a firm education in leadership.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2017-05-14T02:58:17.440418Z","guid":"bbbe7033-6145-4010-9f9a-532be86e693e","rating":4},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":3.33}],"photos":{"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-79.961399,32.796975,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-79.961399,32.796975,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.659217877094972,"count":358},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Charleston, SC"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/citadel-military-college-of-south-carolina/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"b75734e0-c688-4d11-9b8d-8245eac76a78","content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"Middle Tennessee State University","type":"College","url":"middle-tennessee-state-university"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.6861},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":11744},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"950-1160"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Graduate Student","body":"MTSU is a fantastic school. I attended undergrad at a much smaller university in a rural area but the transition to graduate school here has been relatively simple.  I love the closed campus and for me with night classes, parking is relatively close to the buildings and easily accessed. The professors I've had so far are stellar. Even though the school is bigger, the MAcc program still has smaller classes and the professors really take the time to get to know you and assist you if you need it. The food options on campus are also awesome. Coming from the smaller university where the only options were a cafeteria and one small restaurant, I love having a Chick-fil-A or Subway I can hit up before class. I also love the library layout and booth seating.

UT Tyler encourages students to push themselves, but also their staff is willing to aide the students in anyway they need to be successful.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2018-04-06T22:32:31.376669Z","guid":"18e944be-e036-4bef-8831-aa900c8441f1","rating":5},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":3}],"photos":{"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-95.249096,32.314724,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-95.249096,32.314724,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.648675171736997,"count":1019},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Tyler, TX"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/university-of-texas---tyler/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"ed38093b-32e0-4fc3-b01f-8490d67ecd3f","content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"Saint Peter's University","type":"College","url":"saint-peters-university"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.7425},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":14734},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"830-1030"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"College Junior","body":"Saint Peter's is a small campus so it is likely you come across the same people daily. It is in an urban area with a diverse community so I enjoy the atmosphere when I attend classes throughout the day. From experience, I can say the professors and staff are readily available for students during a time of need, whether it is academic or personal. College is what you make it and I am fortunate enough to surround myself with friends who make it such an amazing experience. Being a nursing major, I have a pile of workload so I spend a lot of my time at the library, which is an exceptional place to study in without any distraction. SPU clubs also try to get the students into the school spirit and I can say that there are some fun events that can be attended throughout the school year. Regardless, it is predominately commuter school so many of the students return home after classes end, but it is still possible to make friends on campus!","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2016-07-17T15:11:50Z","guid":"2e815893-7692-496d-a44d-99d2d220a669","rating":4},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":2.66}],"photos":{"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-74.071541,40.727105,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-74.071541,40.727105,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.3712480252764614,"count":633},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Jersey City, NJ"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/saint-peters-university/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"bf552911-195b-4ae7-a9ca-cf32cba4bef5","content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"Fisk University","type":"College","url":"fisk-university"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.7846},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":17980},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"820-1010"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Junior","body":"Fisk University is a wonderful school. It is small and confined that everyone knows each other and has some type of relationship with one another. Everyone at Fisk seems to work as a family. Every family has a combination of personalities and attitudes and majority of the campus knows how to mix in well. There were never any bad stories being told to me before I arrived as a freshman and I still have not heard nor witnessed anything bad about Fisk. The education department here is fantastic and it keeps someone challenged and focused.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2018-05-30T05:29:54.399599Z","guid":"61eea353-e5a8-44b8-a6f0-00d6a8641bd0","rating":5},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":2.33}],"photos":{"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-86.805671,36.16912,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-86.805671,36.16912,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.4295454545454547,"count":440},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Nashville, TN"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/fisk-university/#scatterplot"}}]}
