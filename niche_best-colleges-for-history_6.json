As someone who has seen Washington College from a variety of point of views I can honestly say there is no place better. Whether your passion is in athletics, student government, theatre or anything else on our long list of available opportunities you will find a home at WAC. \n\nOn the side of academics the professors are the ones who deserve so much credit. They will go out of their way to ensure that your are living up to your true potential. With class sizes of about 16-17 students it's hard to hide in the corner or skip class without your professor noticing. Trust me, this is a good thing. If you get the chance to visit campus be sure to swing your department of interest and talk to any of the professors there! Washington College is truly a special place.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2017-06-07T16:00:43.370725Z","guid":"7500bc75-4c9d-469c-b69f-3abc3459fb35","rating":5},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":3.33}],"photos":{"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-76.06878,39.217329,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-76.06878,39.217329,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.5479876160990713,"count":646},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Chestertown, MD"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/washington-college/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"256bfe72-bef3-4a32-accd-91c9306baad9","badge":{"display":"Best Colleges for History in America","ordinal":131,"total":640,"vanityURL":"best-colleges-for-history"},"content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"Centre College","type":"College","url":"centre-college"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.7426},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":25519},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"1080-1340"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Freshman","body":"Centre College, being a small campus, offers a friendly atmosphere and personal connections with other students and professors.

Throughout campus, students are known for their \"busy culture\"; they are determined to find more to get involved in or accomplish.

TAMU is also steeped in traditions that make it an incredibly unique college experience!","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2018-05-28T22:47:05.098811Z","guid":"1bcd4563-84cf-49cf-8e39-de2b0186e8dd","rating":5},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":4.33}],"photos":{"default":{"author":"stuseeger","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/ff5729663bd7a54277d74bd8984e13c49ccf7c45.jpg","MobileHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/7d1b079ee81a8a31c0d2ef4ed9a7a70f12598247.jpg","Thumbnail":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/f676617e01732b695d6b17acf63bafcf2e322892"},"licenseName":"CC BY ","licenseUrl":"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/2.0/","sourceUrl":"https://www.flickr.com/photos/stuseeger/1236808146/"},"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-96.340322,30.613226,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-96.340322,30.613226,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.946622579121398,"count":6351},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"College Station, TX"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/texas-a-and-m-university/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"1f4b31ee-7cb3-400b-820e-bf5acef29989","badge":{"display":"Best Colleges for History in America","ordinal":138,"total":640,"vanityURL":"best-colleges-for-history"},"content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"Furman University","type":"College","url":"furman-university"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.6776},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":31050},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"1120-1340"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Sophomore","body":"Furman is a place where you will be academically pushed to your limits and then some.

Being in Providence means there is always something to do or new to try. While it may not be the safest city, campus security helps make PC feel like it is in its own \"bubble\". Even though the food is not the best on campus, do not feel discouraged because the food off campus is always a hit! Dorms are mostly average, some are great while some of the older buildings definitely need renovation. Athletics are a big plus to this school whether you will be playing or in the audience. The school is strongly affiliated with the Catholic faith, however, all of the professors and Dominican Friars will be welcoming of all religious backgrounds. Also, PC may be lacking in diversity but I can tell they are trying to be more inclusive, especially when it comes to clubs and organizations. Overall, a great (and expensive) school.

From our beautiful Cathedral of Learning (we lovingly call her Cathy) to the spacious Schenley Park, there are tons of secret nooks that are perfect for studying. The professors, while teaching multiple classes, still make themselves available for questions outside the classroom. They are never too busy to stop and chat if you see them around campus; they really care about your education and that you have a passion for what you are studying. Overall, Pitt is an amazing college to attend. The community surrounding the campus challenge you and support you all at once.

The bus system used to transport students from one campus to another is unfortunately sub-par. The drivers take frequent and long breaks, which inconveniences students trying to get to class. A majority of buses themselves don't seem to be well maintained, either, and the bus schedule is unreliable. The quality and variety of the dining hall food is OK, depending on which you go to.

The physics department is particularly impressive, except for its distinct lack of coffee (it's time: get a cafe in/near Loomis already).","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2018-04-29T05:27:03.992779Z","guid":"3d055a45-3d23-42f6-a4eb-65bda8f2a411","rating":4},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":4.33}],"photos":{"default":{"author":"vsmithuk","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/3bd07b7ad6f7539602b686c397574b5df9aedcbd.jpg","MobileHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/a3ceb931e74031ade74565eea2d1d30c9ee4e770.jpg","Thumbnail":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/0ec9783e6ecefa67c0081d4d083fbd2ec39cb2d8"},"licenseName":"CC BY ","licenseUrl":"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/2.0/","sourceUrl":"https://www.flickr.com/photos/vsmithuk/370812598/"},"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-88.230309,40.108864,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-88.230309,40.108864,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.68393536121673,"count":4208},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Champaign, IL"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/university-of-illinois-at-urbana-champaign/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"5029c3cc-a7d0-44a8-ac6a-215575af1342","badge":{"display":"Best Colleges for History in America","ordinal":155,"total":640,"vanityURL":"best-colleges-for-history"},"content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":true,"isPremium":false,"name":"The College of New Jersey","type":"College","url":"the-college-of-new-jersey"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.4886},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":22421},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"1100-1300"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Senior","body":"I am currently attending The College of New Jersey and I absolutely love it. I lived on campus for one year and now I commute from my home in Northern NJ. Since my first major is Education of the Deaf and Hard of Hearing and my second Psychology, I have mainly spent my time in the Education Building and the Social Sciences Building. The professors here are incredibly intelligent and love to get to know the students as more than just a number. This is mainly due to the small class sizes, which I believe is one of the benefits of this institution. The professors are willing to work with you outside of class because they truly value your understanding of the subjects. I am continuously motivated to become a future educator by the professors that I have had and I can't wait to continue on in this career. I always feel safe when I am on campus and although the food isn't amazing, it is much better than other colleges that I have visited! Overall, I love TCNJ and I'm happy to be here!","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2017-08-28T19:33:48.538851Z","guid":"840792aa-a5a7-42bd-8ec9-056731951ed2","rating":5},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":4}],"photos":{"default":{"crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/9ddb981f30eed02e6cecf213ae607bd62719932b.jpg","MobileHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/7bcf96c07543241af5d3b85fe3e9118dfefa260f.jpg"},"licenseName":"UNLICENSED"},"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-74.777412,40.268742,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-74.777412,40.268742,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.573051948051948,"count":1232},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Ewing, NJ"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/the-college-of-new-jersey/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"e3d4751e-98d6-483b-ac91-89481256bfc7","badge":{"display":"Best Colleges for History in America","ordinal":156,"total":640,"vanityURL":"best-colleges-for-history"},"content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":true,"isPremium":false,"name":"University of Dallas","type":"College","url":"university-of-dallas"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.8047},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":25197},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"1040-1290"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Sophomore","body":"Equipped with a rigorous core curriculum and a close-knit community, UD is a nourishing campus. Some crusaders may complain about the reading done at UD, but UD teaches its students the truth about living. We’ve all read Homer, Milton and Dante by the end of our first year in addition to Aristotle, Plato and Aquinas! It’s not just an education based on the sciences but a well-rounded one. The campus is built with boring architecture but within those walls are a family of students and staff who hold on to unique traditions. Groundhog week is only a sneak peek into the energetic and creative life of a crusader. I love UD if there was anything I could improve at UD that would be the Asian Food section in the cafeteria!","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2018-05-27T07:15:52.10381Z","guid":"9ac631be-d6d8-446a-885c-ac5a86b74816","rating":5},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":3.66}],"photos":{"default":{"crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/2c4917a791c4ab2a80f18f22a89c3efabf61e3e9.jpg","MobileHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/7901f500ef29cddd7e11e12728afad910104670a.jpg"},"licenseName":"UNLICENSED"},"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-96.9179,32.8443,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-96.9179,32.8443,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.7164835164835166,"count":455},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Irving, TX"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/university-of-dallas/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"9bdd7fc7-5ebb-4a73-8b55-850e2769d3bc","badge":{"display":"Best Colleges for History in America","ordinal":157,"total":640,"vanityURL":"best-colleges-for-history"},"content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":true,"isPremium":false,"name":"Presbyterian College","type":"College","url":"presbyterian-college"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.5983},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":19777},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"1000-1210"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Freshman","body":"Presbyterian College is a great place for any type of student.
