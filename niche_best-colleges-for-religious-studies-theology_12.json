It is a gorgeous campus. It also has an amazing staff who take the time to know you well. It is a Southern Baptist school, so most of the students have more conservative values although they are not insanely conservative and are very open minded to the ideas of other individuals. Samford is also located in a nice area of Birmingham, AL that offers enough fun to try something new every weekend. The area also contains many healthy churches that can enrich your college experience ten-fold.\nThere are some pitfalls. The diversity here is a bit pitiful and the conservative atmosphere of the school may also be suffocating to certain individuals. Parties are fairly few and far between. However, it is easy to find other places in Birmingham to party or dance if you are looking for that sort of scene.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2018-01-19T18:22:13.325725Z","guid":"b798cac4-162b-4396-9ee9-bb303e73ad0f","rating":5},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":3.66}],"photos":{"default":{"crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/15fccd3ac6b7a2c2969729c22316a789adc3748f.jpg","MobileHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/8ad7f28e75dee67d79ce128d598ad4705f4728f3.jpg"},"licenseName":"UNLICENSED"},"mapbox_header":{"crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-86.790932,33.464578,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-86.790932,33.464578,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"UNLICENSED"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.7466666666666666,"count":675},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Birmingham, AL"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/samford-university/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"6596010e-594b-49f4-9a98-923eed5078c1","content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"Catholic University of America","type":"College","url":"catholic-university-of-america"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.7955},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":36009},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"1020-1230"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Freshman","body":"It's great!

Academics are outstanding. Classes are interesting and challenging, the professors are brilliant and accessible. Both semesters I got the classes I wanted, though sometimes your have to sit in for a first few days before getting in. (Common at liberal arts schools.) \n\nOberlin is a great size, small enough to feel like a community but large enough to keep meeting new people. Students are friendly. Some are quirky, athletic, political, or musical, but they are a great mix and you may be surprised at the friendships you make. There is always something to do on campus, and it is easy to get to Cleveland if you miss urban life. \n\nAthletics continue to improve, with several conference championships. Conservatory concerts are popular. The dining hall food is average, but if you like to cook or have dietary restrictions, you should consider joining a fun and delicious dining co-op.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2018-03-06T05:22:03.072255Z","guid":"7b628b94-f7f3-4fed-927e-71543287c20f","rating":5},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":4}],"photos":{"default":{"author":"sequencia","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/232068422ae94e1bf42cd7daf06f137ed8897c7c.jpg","MobileHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/305240c02b5d6f7eada3de2bf5ac141e00fe748c.jpg","Thumbnail":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/86f61778585249c0d5be198d4715b19b5a2d9a85"},"licenseName":"CC BY ","licenseUrl":"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/2.0/","sourceUrl":"https://www.flickr.com/photos/sequencia/567841903/"},"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-82.221786,41.29474,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-82.221786,41.29474,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.6582064297800336,"count":591},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Oberlin, OH"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/oberlin-college/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"0055c0af-444e-46b0-a9a0-857a5e30966b","content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":true,"isPremium":false,"name":"Colgate University","type":"College","url":"colgate-university"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.2878},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":22463},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"1290-1460"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Senior","body":"Colgate has changed my life.

About to finish my third year, I can say with certainty that my parents' money is paying off.  I have taken at least three courses that have permanently shaped the way I view the world and continue to influence me every single day.  Professors are incredible and very easy to access outside of class.  There are also so many extracurricular activities to participate in, and if something you want is not there, it is very easy to start your own club!  The campus dining services are incredible.  Dhall is life and I would be so lost without Spa and Burgess.  Dorms and on-campus apartments are spacious and have everything you could possibly need!  I definitely made the right choice coming here.  There is no Greek life, which is awesome in my opinion.  Also, Saratoga Springs is quite possibly the most beautiful little city I have ever seen.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2017-04-29T07:19:37.052188Z","guid":"f94500b1-e292-4030-9a3b-c6f1d4c25d0a","rating":5},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":4}],"photos":{"default":{"crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/ad72f5277e4ca7e90712c9b8145a1145168a0ce2.jpg","MobileHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/2026051e4b310b6e180caee134f54593e2b98e3a.jpg"},"licenseName":"UNLICENSED"},"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-73.785108,43.092696,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-73.785108,43.092696,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.6763698630136985,"count":584},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Saratoga Springs, NY"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/skidmore-college/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"5713e47f-56bb-4c69-931d-d70beaff0b2d","content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":true,"isPremium":false,"name":"Point Loma Nazarene University","type":"College","url":"point-loma-nazarene-university"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.6942},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":29954},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"1030-1240"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Sophomore","body":"This school is fantastic!

I see lots of different schools and interact with dozens of student populations. Each campus has a different vibe and feel, and conversations in campus coffee shops range from purely academic to purely social. I loved Middlebury for the blend of high caliber academics, a hardworking student body, and a focus on active, healthy lifestyles. Students at Middlebury balance work and play, and a weekend was never without hours in the library or miles of hiking, running or biking. The teachers have high expectations for your work, but they understand there's more to get out of college than acing every exam. As I tour college campuses today, I look for candidates who strike that same balance, who take their work seriously, but they don't take themselves too seriously. That's what Middlebury is about.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2018-02-14T22:01:07.442777Z","guid":"539b0218-3556-4d2a-bd12-0d882aa28acf","rating":5},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":4.33}],"photos":{"default":{"author":"nancieshelburnemuseum","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/c7dab09e874e9dc1c9f67b919a524daca66c766e.jpg","MobileHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/bee6c4ec7223ca60becf94d85b9239006619756a.jpg","Thumbnail":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/c979f1762857254a1de8cca3b00a8cd840a6e2b5"},"licenseName":"CC BY ","licenseUrl":"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/2.0/","sourceUrl":"https://www.flickr.com/photos/nancieshelburnemuseum/7711386868/"},"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-73.176068,44.009117,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-73.176068,44.009117,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.740663900414938,"count":482},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Middlebury, VT"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/middlebury-college/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"10591a8d-619b-4c83-8026-cf6efcd12d36","content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":true,"isPremium":false,"name":"Smith College","type":"College","url":"smith-college"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.3723},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":24258},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"1240-1470"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Sophomore","body":"I am a sophomore transfer student at Smith and I have loved my experience so far. The classes are wonderful and the professors are always helpful and caring. I feel challenged but not completely overwhelmed, even while competing as a student-athlete. The food here is good enough for dorm food. As long as you don't expect gourmet meals, you should be fine. Smith tries very hard to cater to vegan/vegetarians/allergies, but they could do more, especially for gluten allergies. Because I am so busy, I am not much of a partier, so it's a positive for me that Smith is not a party school. From what I have heard, the parties are very tame here, which is not for everyone! \nNorthampton is a cute little town that has just enough to keep me from being bored.

That is the only very thing I would love to change or improve in their system.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2017-07-27T03:40:05.670052Z","guid":"ed79dc10-5038-443f-9d6f-6c9c18ced868","rating":4},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":2.66}],"photos":{"default":{"crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/ec94ed4f47053f1660a2b67c40a1b6a367ef08ec.jpg","MobileHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/fec68ae3cc28e7cbdc8f28f12fad33ffc0b9aeb0.jpg"},"licenseName":"UNLICENSED"},"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-82.905986,39.610895,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-82.905986,39.610895,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.8592233009708736,"count":412},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Circleville, OH"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/ohio-christian-university/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"3c342441-3847-44b0-843a-71798dc38fbc","content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":true,"isPremium":true,"name":"George Fox University","type":"College","url":"george-fox-university"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.6376},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":27935},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"960-1200"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Alum","body":"Pros: The campus is pretty, academics are good, esteemed university,  and \"most\" professors are great. \nCons: Cliques, expensive, lacking diversity, shove religious views down your throat and if you don't agree your grade suffers yet the student portal is evidence of rampant drugs/sex/partying, no assistance with job placement if you are an Adult degree student, and the film program professors need to be fired - horrible favoritism, uncommunicative, arrogant, and just plain nasty! \nIn summary, it's a good school IF you choose the right program, stay to yourself, and do NOT live on campus!","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2016-12-30T05:31:48.830302Z","guid":"7da76adc-aba8-410b-a1c4-826ceff43707","rating":4},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":3.33}],"photos":{"default":{"crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/6170a3885d9ecdc5201d38894d3582b9d268590b.jpg","MobileHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/b8ef0cf6216d83b98690a3bda515e0499ad33414.jpg"},"licenseName":"UNLICENSED"},"mapbox_header":{"crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-122.968394,45.30399,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-122.968394,45.30399,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"UNLICENSED"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.799778761061947,"count":904},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Newberg, OR"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/george-fox-university/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"18ec6651-0bc7-46a3-b58a-0b6da466605b","content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":true,"isPremium":false,"name":"Stonehill College","type":"College","url":"stonehill-college"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.7292},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":31010},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"1030-1230"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Sophomore","body":"Stonehill College is a beautiful school located in the suburbs of Easton Ma.
