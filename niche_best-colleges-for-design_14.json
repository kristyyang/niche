MVNU is a very small, community based university so therefore it is easy to get to know someone fast and there is a lot of support for someone to be there. Academically, MVNU challenged me in ways my high school education could not and it has transformed me into a smarter and quicker learner, writer, speaker, and thinker. MVNU also has taught me over 1 semester how to be self-reliant and independent as an adult which is a great lesson to have in life.

With the small class room sizes, you are able to not develop close relations to your peers, but your professors as well. A professor-student  relationship is crucial not only in the learning process, but even future academic adventures outside of Adrian. The professors are more than willing to sit down with you and break it down, piece by piece. You are not just another nameless face, you are you. Being a liberal arts college, distributions are a requirement. Though they may be an annoyance at first, they become well-rounded student shaping machines. Through these classes, you are able to educate your self of the other perceptions, cultures, and ideas along with the synthesis of your own. Though the social scene is somewhat lacking, Adrian College makes up for it in its application of the Arts and Sciences.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2018-05-02T01:16:08.435687Z","guid":"f0228f49-3de9-4c02-9e74-64b584d68ec4","rating":5},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":2.66}],"photos":{"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-84.059947,41.898449,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-84.059947,41.898449,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.442906574394464,"count":578},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Adrian, MI"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/adrian-college/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"afc0b74e-6160-405f-b9ec-69f67855b331","content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"Linfield College","type":"College","url":"linfield-college"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.8075},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":28389},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"920-1150"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Senior","body":"I am the first person in my family to graduate high school, let alone go to college.

Professors care and work with you.  Many repeatedly encourage students to visit offices.  Very open. Running trail by cornfields,  wetlands to explore, two lakes, a cemetery, woods, and school is only 2-10 minutes from Walmart/The Mall/etc (Many job opps aside from work study).  Mass held in the basilica on Sunday. Professors are also VERY FRIENDLY monks that live on campus.  Don't feel pressured if not religious, no requirements.\n\nMiscellaneous:\nAthletics huge here.  Will pass several official/intramural teams daily.\nTuition reduced a lot.  Listed price is falsely high.\nSafe.  Quiet/calm weekends.\nHousing OKAY.  Really depends.\nGood food.  Can be repetitive though.

I would recommend this college to people going into a medical profession.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2017-11-30T22:20:39.046453Z","guid":"56a7d5aa-84c0-4def-b962-67e0daa6e04b","rating":4},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":3}],"photos":{"default":{"crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/e04e0929d9a9b41e95b74658088e8b3da0dd200d.jpg","MobileHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/d7600d10ea98d56a910cffaf26fbd0e9f41cbfba.jpg"},"licenseName":"UNLICENSED"},"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-122.449639,38.57409,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-122.449639,38.57409,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.756019261637239,"count":623},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Angwin, CA"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/pacific-union-college/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"217c6469-d9ae-4464-980c-8516bedb98b4","content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":true,"isPremium":false,"name":"Lubbock Christian University","type":"College","url":"lubbock-christian-university"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.9531},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":21071},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"900-1190"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Niche User","body":"It's on my family farm.  This is a small friendly West Texas Christian University in an extremely nice larger West Texas University town.  It is less diverse than people there understand but the Religious Denomination that runs the school works at being \"Color blind.\"  This school is likely torture for a North Eastern Liberal Black Lesbian!  And likely \"Heaven\" for a Shy Conservative not too over-achieving black or white straight kid.  The Social life is the Religious life or you're going to Texas Tech for parties.  This school started in the 1950's & strictly follows it's founding Religious principles...kindly.  This is about where George Bush had his wild drunken party days.

The poor reviews are so false. The campus is beautiful and the seasons you endure here make it so much fun. The professors are here to help you and make sure you succeed well into your profession.  The old classrooms make it feel like you go to A prestigious university. The food here... yeah that sucks. Everyone is involved in athletics, so if you aren't an athlete don't come.  The parties are extremely underrated. Baseball houses throw the absolute best parties and it is always a good time. The worst parties are usually thrown by the football team. But they still rock. Cleveland Ohio is a happening place to be for not only school but a social life as well! NDC IS THE PLACE TO BE AND THE GIRLS ARE SO HOT!

Whether that’s through freshman activities, great professors, or just awesome, nice people, Concordia is extremely welcoming to everyone and anyone. Oh and I can’t forget to mention how awesome free parking at the university is! \nI would, however, change the policies pertaining to the hours that boys/girls can be in each other’s dorms. I think that this policy should be different because by the time we get to college, we are adults. We should be capable of making our own mature decisions pertaining to the opposite gender. \nThe smallness of Concordia is one of its positives and negatives. It is a good thing because of how easy it is to know your fellow students, athletes, faculty, and even the president of the university. The negative of the smallness of the school is that everyone knows everything, word travels very fast.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2018-01-03T16:43:38.630766Z","guid":"d8e0a378-269a-4587-8b87-0fb383cd5cc8","rating":4},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":3}],"photos":{"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-97.089054,40.914853,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-97.089054,40.914853,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.672316384180791,"count":354},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Seward, NE"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/concordia-university---nebraska/#scatterplot"}}]}
