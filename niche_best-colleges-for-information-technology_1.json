It can be very stressful, but making it through did convince me that I could persevere through anything, something that has benefitted me a lot out in the working world. I'll always prefer to hire CMU graduates because I of this.\n\nSports? Nah. Don't go there for sports. Campus? A lot better now then when I was there! Dorms? They're OK but moved off campus after 1st year. Parties? Well my group of friends had a lot of house parties but this was more Art, Design, Drama and random stragglers group ;) Pittsburgh? Wasn't convinced at the time (wanted to be in NYC) but it's a good place to go to school - enough to do, fairly safe, pretty cheap to live, plenty of arts and culture if you want it, decent food, etc.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2017-03-13T11:15:56.240234Z","guid":"df7737e7-ed6e-4f5d-98f2-98b597aa87f2","rating":4},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":4.33}],"photos":{"default":{"crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/26f58f82eaaef86dd7fbb0581d7023548e81efee.jpg","MobileHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/69601a778e428a6e6dedb34fcb0e2643dbcca6f6.jpg"},"licenseName":"UNLICENSED"},"mapbox_header":{"crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-79.942914,40.444616,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-79.942914,40.444616,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"UNLICENSED"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.6399099774943737,"count":1333},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Pittsburgh, PA"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/carnegie-mellon-university/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"c35e497b-10bc-4482-92e5-f27941433b02","badge":{"display":"Best Colleges for Information Technology in America","ordinal":2,"total":114,"vanityURL":"best-colleges-for-information-technology"},"content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"Cornell University","type":"College","url":"cornell-university"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.1409},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":30014},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"1330-1530"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Alum","body":"Below are 3 things I consider Cornell as a great investment.\n1. reputation\nEvery people, including people at work, recognizes me as a \"smart Cornell girl\"\n2.

UTD is fairly close to Dallas and has a modern-type campus with many new buildings recently built.

All around, it's my dream University.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2018-03-28T19:01:53.950799Z","guid":"053f6b46-001a-463c-918a-bb2b3715a877","rating":5},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":3.66}],"photos":{"default":{"author":"30791749@N07","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/fb90d2b3ad935c89ade7379fbae247b55fda1dd6.jpg","MobileHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/bcfdc0f48a7c27526977a21dfa677e69b4844f1c.jpg","Thumbnail":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/68d3568efbd5aaba40447846736fa48571b1d802"},"licenseName":"CC BY ","licenseUrl":"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/2.0/","sourceUrl":"https://www.flickr.com/photos/30791749@N07/11540284636/"},"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-97.361537,32.709568,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-97.361537,32.709568,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.85,"count":1460},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Fort Worth, TX"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/texas-christian-university/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"68e77f22-ad27-473f-acd6-7a228732577f","badge":{"display":"Best Colleges for Information Technology in America","ordinal":22,"total":114,"vanityURL":"best-colleges-for-information-technology"},"content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"University of Maryland - Baltimore County","type":"College","url":"university-of-maryland---baltimore-county"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.5683},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":15349},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"1120-1320"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Junior","body":"UMBC meets its claim to \"top public college in America\" within the first week. Even as a commuter, \"welcome week\" was the perfect break-me-out-of-my-shell experience I needed to feel comfortable in going to college here, at UMBC. And it didn't stop there! Every semester the school creates a new way to include its students from all walks of life. There are many organizations that are eager to gain new recruits; there are always emails and chalk drawings that invite people to join the UMBC community or show your Retriever Pride; and there are so many safe, private places to study or just relax without feeling like you're in the middle of nowhere.\nNot to mention you are a short bus-ride away from plenty of off-campus attractions, if you ever feel the need to escape campus life (many of these excursions are even organized by  the Student Events Board). \nThis is the perfect small campus, with a big college feel.

Let's start off with academics. All the professors know their students on a first name basis and are genuinely dedicated to teaching, making sure the students comprehend the content in the course, and helping students further their education.My first semester in my new major made me realize I had made the right choice for my career goals. The courses were exactly what I was looking for and we even got to work with real clients in the Burlington area. This brings me to my second point, job placement and connections. I know the reason I decided to go to college was to broaden my opportunity for employment. There are so many opportunities to network, get internships, or gain experience that will help you when looking for jobs post-graduation. My final point is the campus. Visiting Campus is a MUST! Burlington is the perfect setting for Campus, especially in the fall when the leaves change and it looks like an L.L.Bean catalog.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2017-10-25T15:13:07.841671Z","guid":"4a4f81a8-8316-4c23-a201-2203be66fc72","rating":5},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":3}],"photos":{"default":{"crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/2bd30051950fe211dcef91c2a025e085dee4fee7.jpg","MobileHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/0d1a1ec1c61a8489201f4ad2d483101ef5c6716c.jpg"},"licenseName":"UNLICENSED"},"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-73.204354,44.47295,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-73.204354,44.47295,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.640058055152395,"count":689},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Burlington, VT"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/champlain-college/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"909c77eb-776f-417e-9230-6919ab231a2b","badge":{"display":"Best Colleges for Information Technology in America","ordinal":24,"total":114,"vanityURL":"best-colleges-for-information-technology"},"content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"University of South Florida","type":"College","url":"university-of-south-florida"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.4663},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":11398},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"1070-1250"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Sophomore","body":"USF has surpassed any expectations I ever had on what life would be at college.  Being a relatively new university there is a lot of pride and youthful energy in the professors, administration, and students. The MSC is a great student hub with a good food court, a restaurant, 4 floors of study or “chilling” areas, offices, event rooms, a theater, a ballroom, a pharmacy, a computer store and many more things. The library has resources from state of the art equipment, macs and PCs, digital media equipment with green screens, quiet study floors, a Starbucks, tutoring center, a writing center and so many more things. Central campus is very pretty and very green, with the MLK plaza in the middle and trees perfectly lined up. The athletics are great including the 3 gyms which include an indoor and an outdoor swimming pools, dance studio, wrestling room, cardio floor, weight floor, indoor track, volleyball, basketball and racquetball courts.
