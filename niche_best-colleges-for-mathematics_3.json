By that, I mean that it's smaller than my high school. To be quite honest, there really isn't much to do within the town of Davidson, and without a car, Charlotte isn't exactly accessible. I knew all too well of this, but I still decided to come here because Davidson genuinely is an amazing school. Professors are very engaged with their students and I can definitely see how passionate they are about the courses they teach. Class sizes are great as well, with several of my classes having fewer than 15 students and none over ~30. While diversity of the student population leaves something to be desired, Davidson is slowly improving.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2018-05-02T04:56:40.035205Z","guid":"a1640b05-25eb-482b-bc41-64af8fe060b1","rating":5},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":4.33}],"photos":{"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-80.845236,35.500006,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-80.845236,35.500006,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.8776978417266186,"count":278},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Davidson, NC"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/davidson-college/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"bc6f707c-da0e-4db1-b06f-ebfe9473423b","badge":{"display":"Best Colleges for Math in America","ordinal":52,"total":398,"vanityURL":"best-colleges-for-math"},"content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":true,"isPremium":false,"name":"Johns Hopkins University","type":"College","url":"johns-hopkins-university"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.1284},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":27352},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"1400-1570"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Graduate Student","body":"I am a first year graduate student in their online Museum Studies program.

There are a lot of philanthropic opportunities, as well as many clubs that give leadership lessons in whatever the student desires. Because Georgia Tech is a world-class campus, the opportunities offered to the students are many and are also well-funded for those who do not have a lot of money themselves. Because of this, over half of the student body participates in a program of campus before they graduate, which will normally be things like an internship, co-op, or studying abroad. The professors at this institute are extremely knowledgable in what they teach and most make an effort to meet the student where they need in order to further their academic progress. Overall, everyone on campus strives for greatness and bringing something into the world that helps them accomplish their dreams.

Colby students are friendly, extremely intelligent, and well-rounded. Most of my friends volunteered, had an on-campus job or worked in a lab, and actively participated in campus clubs. The Colby bubble can become a little suffocating, as it is easy to not leave campus for weeks, but I am honestly sad I will never be in such a tight-knit community of similar-minded peers again.

Additionally, with thousands of clubs, there are plenty of ways to get involved. On another note, there are many stereotypes of people who come to the University, but I promise that not all of us are preppy, rich, and white, though a good portion is. The only problems I have with UVA are the prices of tuition and the honor code. Tuition is expensive and instead of giving grants UVA sometimes gives a lot of loans.

Despite the weather (which I am now used to), I fell in love with Case and the nursing school because of the commitment to intelligence and hands-on learning. When I was in my second week of college ever, I was in the hospital interacting with patients. I even helped save someone's life before my first semester ended.

Not for everyone - just for the people who want to change the world.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2017-12-31T07:20:22.264195Z","guid":"05c1bf63-f01f-4f28-a172-b455f36370e8","rating":5},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":4.33}],"photos":{"default":{"author":"mulad ","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/cd64aeb72019cecb4dc9f4c36fcda7a18b2ea11b.jpg","MobileHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/f7af294df292da8c8e91080b14b4269c6ad55a30.jpg","Thumbnail":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/fdd99b9863999e773b670fd38f12c2cf17df4974"},"licenseName":"CC BY ","licenseUrl":"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/2.0/","sourceUrl":"https://www.flickr.com/photos/mulad/3237562307/"},"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-93.169855,44.936709,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-93.169855,44.936709,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.7049608355091386,"count":383},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Saint Paul, MN"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/macalester-college/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"4f186de4-b8ba-4895-981e-cce08c5a0c50","badge":{"display":"Best Colleges for Math in America","ordinal":63,"total":398,"vanityURL":"best-colleges-for-math"},"content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"Mount Holyoke College","type":"College","url":"mount-holyoke-college"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.5219},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":27234},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"1220-1490"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Sophomore","body":"Mount Holyoke College is a lovely, accepting institution.

The students can get a little rattled when it comes to politics and it's really liberal, some people like that others don't, just depends on who you talk to. The campus is sooo beautiful all throughout the year! And housing is one the best parts because most of the rooms are really big and you can get a single your sophomore year. The college also does a good job at matching roommates for first years. It can get a little boring because it's in a suburb but Philly close enough that you could go into the city every weekend if you wanted to. Would totally recommend!","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2018-05-18T05:04:59.044449Z","guid":"27d7d76c-deec-4628-a32d-3162e1c17955","rating":5},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":4.33}],"photos":{"default":{"crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/ecdd8074e47e0bcb6911f70827a352327141106b.jpg","MobileHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/95b712df16ca6724c566eb5b1cd5a5e814f75cf5.jpg"},"licenseName":"UNLICENSED"},"mapbox_header":{"crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-75.314988,40.028541,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-75.314988,40.028541,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"UNLICENSED"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.8703241895261846,"count":401},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Bryn Mawr, PA"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/bryn-mawr-college/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"bc90e2b6-e112-43ed-ac5c-3548829ea3dd","badge":{"display":"Best Colleges for Math in America","ordinal":70,"total":398,"vanityURL":"best-colleges-for-math"},"content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"University of Texas - Austin","type":"College","url":"university-of-texas---austin"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.4037},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":16010},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"1140-1410"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Junior","body":"In one sentence:there.is.something.for.everyone!

From political to adventurous student organizations, to meeting the very brightest professors and students in your chosen field, you will never cease to be amazed by the unlimited amount of opportunities available to you. For instance, I am a double major in Government and International Relations and Global Studies and am continuously amazed at the amount of programs, events, lectures , courses, and books available just for students in those majors. Your college's department of Career Services will blow you away as well, they will provide any and all resources to ensure your success after graduation. Most of all, UT is a highly respected university in the state of Texas and beyond, a degree from UT will go a very long way! I highly recommend studying here.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2018-04-04T20:57:10.298437Z","guid":"1b42f115-4293-493e-ab3c-4ebb9fead894","rating":5},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":4.33}],"photos":{"default":{"author":"jrandallc","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/062118de6b330627760d55de6c32cf824efa040b.jpg","MobileHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/8af2b0aa0e38489ab3331f7d629df02edec81728.jpg","Thumbnail":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/154967d69077062224951037e47fe52285fdde61"},"licenseName":"CC BY-SA","licenseUrl":"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/","sourceUrl":"https://www.flickr.com/photos/jrandallc/5207440826/"},"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-97.737279,30.284733,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-97.737279,30.284733,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.9090425531914894,"count":5640},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Austin, TX"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/university-of-texas---austin/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"8d5e952b-9d81-43bb-807a-ac7d8f81f908","badge":{"display":"Best Colleges for Math in America","ordinal":71,"total":398,"vanityURL":"best-colleges-for-math"},"content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"Vassar College","type":"College","url":"vassar-college"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.2688},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":21933},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"1330-1500"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Alum","body":"I loved being a student at Vassar!

There are campus events for everyone in any college and there are events that are specific to each individual college. \nThe people here each have amazing distinct personalities in which anyone can find who they vibe with easily.
