The best thing about Wells are the professors. They are invested in you and see you as an individual and not as a number. If you're not doing particularly well, they can set up time for you to review the material because they want you to succeed. Most professors also send out internship opportunities so students can immerse themselves in that particular field.  Clubs like Querencia and Umoja, try to make the school as inclusive as possible by engaging students in hot topics like racism and segregation. They also strive on being active figures in the community, frequently hosting blood drives and potlucks. As an NCAA division 3 school, athletics are what you expect it to be, however, students on campus take their job as athletes seriously. Everyone tries to support each team by showing up to games especially for sports like Volleyball and Basketball.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2017-11-01T18:36:27.356579Z","guid":"fc2bcfcb-d9d1-415c-a33a-e597968bb57b","rating":5},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":2.66}],"photos":{"default":{"crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/735eb3e8a94a96772ab8c570f0f7ab331f9a0377.jpg","MobileHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/6cc203a682a3b221dd174d5e333f710e4f073cdd.jpg"},"licenseName":"UNLICENSED"},"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-76.696512,42.744314,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-76.696512,42.744314,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.1945392491467577,"count":293},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Aurora, NY"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/wells-college/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"2ba75db3-d155-4978-9b0e-f83b9934f26e","badge":{"display":"Best Colleges for History in America","ordinal":240,"total":640,"vanityURL":"best-colleges-for-history"},"content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":true,"isPremium":true,"name":"Ouachita Baptist University","type":"College","url":"ouachita-baptist-university"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.6688},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":18789},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"950-1200"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Senior","body":"Without a doubt, Ouachita is the best choice I could’ve made to further my education.

Another Downside I notice is that if you are an environmental Science major, there is only one professor that teaches most of the related and required courses that you need to take so if you don't like that professor, you are stuck with him.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2018-01-22T02:09:46.788381Z","guid":"6a5ba709-3575-4ef7-ab39-067c7e19cb81","rating":5},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":3.33}],"photos":{"default":{"crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/4f10633795264bc68f217d2de4b877d0c97220eb.jpg","MobileHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/6cbb0c14d5d6a79b61567239e67ecef009fecc9f.jpg"},"licenseName":"UNLICENSED"},"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-78.47586,42.07863,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-78.47586,42.07863,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.560493827160494,"count":405},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Saint Bonaventure, NY"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/st-bonaventure-university/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"b6fa95d1-441d-4568-ab4d-6e8fe10653ca","badge":{"display":"Best Colleges for History in America","ordinal":245,"total":640,"vanityURL":"best-colleges-for-history"},"content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"Berry College","type":"College","url":"berry-college"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.6209},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":24811},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"1060-1240"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Sophomore","body":"Berry College has an amazing student to professor ratio.

Hendrix College can be way too stressful at times, but at the end of the day, there are plenty of resources to help those in need of stress relief. The student housing for underclassmen, however, is abysmal. The dorms are not in the best shape, but there are plans to renovate in the next 5 years. The student Quad is better, yet the walls are so thin you can hear the student above you sneezing. The apartments are better, but they are sometimes a crap-shoot.

Whether it be an intro class or a more fine-tuned 400-level class, each professor that has given a lecture to me has granted me the opportunity of hearing new insight and viewing the world in a fresh perspective. \n\nI resided in Ellicott Complex, which served as shelter for my first-year experience.

The atmosphere on campus and through out the whole community is one of adventure and excitement. The students really enjoy getting outside and getting active.

With thousands of international students and its central location, the diversity is special and so treasured on this campus. I am never worried about making friends of different backgrounds, or finding my niche with those who share my cultural background because it happens so naturally. There are also plenty of religious groups to get plugged into on and around campus. My only complaint is the Hill, but it is worth it to live in Pomfret Hall with bigger bathrooms, a nice common area, and the dining hall which comes in handy on days of inclement weather. I truly love being a Razorback, and am so grateful to call Northwest Arkansas my second home.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2017-12-31T08:20:55.505021Z","guid":"743e04d5-da12-4e79-b8a9-e1fbbec69371","rating":5},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":4}],"photos":{"default":{"author":"mtnorton","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/5469a0f272cd5651b2fcfac357f368e9aedfee1b.jpg","MobileHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/c40b369d23ffb3ef5ca2388827b771cfcb22ef59.jpg","Thumbnail":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/a2ba338f9c416b38ba6a2ee45506047d4f0176e7"},"licenseName":"CC BY ","licenseUrl":"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/2.0/","sourceUrl":"https://www.flickr.com/photos/mtnorton/7212584262/"},"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-94.178214,36.06153,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-94.178214,36.06153,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.787639710716634,"count":3042},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Fayetteville, AR"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/university-of-arkansas/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"bdac122e-a35a-4b98-81df-b60b0070f01d","badge":{"display":"Best Colleges for History in America","ordinal":253,"total":640,"vanityURL":"best-colleges-for-history"},"content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"University of Scranton","type":"College","url":"university-of-scranton"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.7455},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":33701},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"1030-1220"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Niche User","body":"The University of Scranton is a private, non-profit, co-educational, Catholic and Jesuit research university, located in the historic Hill Section of Scranton, Pennsylvania, United States.

While the Diocese of Scranton retained ownership of the University, it was administered by the Lasallian Christian Brothers from 1888 to 1942.[4] In 1942, the Society of Jesus took ownership and control of the University.[5] During the 1960s, the University became an independent institution under a lay Board of Trustees.

There is truly no greater resource to college students than having professors who care about your academic career and success. There have been countless occasions where the help or advice of a professor has totally altered my performance in a class for the better. The students are all very respectful and hard-working.
