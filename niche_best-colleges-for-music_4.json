If students take their time here, and use the networking and resources that are available it is absolutely amazing the places you can go.

My professors so far are amazing and accommodating, and I adore the classes despite some of them being difficult.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2018-02-02T03:57:32.480614Z","guid":"2b7e0093-623b-4d85-ba8b-bd2e7e408db3","rating":5},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":3.33}],"photos":{"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-89.33791,31.327499,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-89.33791,31.327499,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.662516382699869,"count":1526},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Hattiesburg, MS"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/university-of-southern-mississippi/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"c67d3421-4e03-479c-815d-25e92bf34d8c","content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"SUNY College at Oneonta","type":"College","url":"suny-college-at-oneonta"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.5284},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":15498},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"980-1160"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Freshman","body":"I’m a Freshman at Oneonta, and in the short time that I’ve been at Oneonta I’ve learned a whole lot. As a first in family minority student, I was reluctant to go to a big school not known to have a diverse student body. However, I’ve noticed the freshman student body is  more diverse than I expected and the school is not as big as I thought. I see many of the people in my hall around campus. The class sizes are small 15-25 students. The city of Oneonta is cute and transportation to the mall and other main spots is easily accessible. The RA’s are always there to help me with anything big or small. The freshman dorms seem to be the newest! The food is okay, it’s not moms cooking but there’s a lot of selections and 3 main dining halls around campus. Professors have overall been very supportive and helpful. Overall my experience has been very good. There’s many clubs and organizations that can help one branch out and meet new people, College is what you make it!","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2018-01-09T04:21:25.410091Z","guid":"f7a74e4d-846e-48e1-8a96-1e1e0069ea68","rating":4},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":3}],"photos":{"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-75.064186,42.466555,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-75.064186,42.466555,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.5116504854368933,"count":1030},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Oneonta, NY"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/suny-college-at-oneonta/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"7c53d020-3e53-4ea8-b7c1-45be4627d53d","content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"Rider University","type":"College","url":"rider-university"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.7151},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":29037},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"916-1110"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Junior","body":"Rider University has been great.

The blueprints were staged by former Engineering Alumni.  This significant mark on the campus is a great accomplishment and success story in its own for new students to be captivated by.  The school tours are lead by selected honors students of the university who also mentor, guide, and inspire new students.     The university has the highest number of students enrolled ever this year.  The campus is centrally located to multiple apartment buildings and restaurants.

My course and professors all inspired me to find my passion. I changed my major after the first semester; which allowed me to explore the different career paths before I chose my current career goal. ASU truly opened my eyes to a lot of wonderful opportunities. I am taking my experiences working alongside my peers in the school newspaper \"State Press\" and student outreach \"Programming and Activities Board\" to learn valuable work ethics for future career skills. As a medical studies major, I still find it important to surround myself with other activities and involvements that are not related to my major. Therefore, the school paper gives me sense of the journalism world and the PAB allows me to explore skills in marketing and event planning. Overall, my experience at ASU change my life and improved my skills that pertains to social, professional, and personal life skills.

I highly recommend University of New Haven to all the international students!","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2017-05-25T01:21:10.999955Z","guid":"c18bb70a-3ee3-4b04-989a-3e22a831a8ca","rating":5},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":2.66}],"photos":{"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-72.961472,41.291314,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-72.961472,41.291314,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.4747801943544654,"count":2161},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"West Haven, CT"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/university-of-new-haven/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"de4ffcd6-4848-4c1e-80c7-0845b01989cd","content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"CUNY Hunter College","type":"College","url":"cuny-hunter-college"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.3788},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":10201},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"1060-1260"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Junior","body":"My experience in this accredited college was a seamless transition from high school. Hunter offers a plethora of majors to choose from as well as different clubs to keep students engaged. There are also activities and events held on campus. The workload may be overwhelming at times but I regard it as excellent preparation for graduate school and an opportunity to challenge myself. The location of Hunter is convenient; it is located in the city so your choices don't fall short when it comes to food. Hunter has a library on nine floors. My complaint is that when you attend Hunter no one tells you anything unless you ask many, many questions! I know several people who took the incorrect class for their major, wasting time and money. Additionally, I feel that in large lecture halls with more than 100 students, there isn't a chance to receive individualized attention. The classroom size should be smaller so professors can focus on every students' needs and struggles.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2018-01-16T22:01:16.773582Z","guid":"61dee6aa-64ee-4526-9449-0dd06859694f","rating":4},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":3}],"photos":{"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-73.964795,40.768669,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-73.964795,40.768669,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.439636752136752,"count":1872},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"New York, NY"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/cuny-hunter-college/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"d62788df-48cc-4f06-90b7-d50f9d26a735","content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"William Paterson University of New Jersey","type":"College","url":"william-paterson-university-of-new-jersey"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.7564},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":15530},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"890-1080"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Sophomore","body":"My experience at William Paterson has been awesome. I transferred from another university so it was easy for me to compare the two and William Paterson definitely out shinned the other. At William Paterson I experienced a number of clubs, organizations, and activities to be apart of. The environment itself also felt comforting and enjoyable. It is an awesome school for commuters and for residents because it provides great opportunities for both. Therefore in my opinion William Paterson University is not just a great  university because of its organizations but because of the great programs and opportunities they provide as well.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2018-01-11T00:10:13.162733Z","guid":"69e26c11-e848-4425-993e-9e9b0ad4050f","rating":5},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":2.66}],"photos":{"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-74.199465,40.946256,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-74.199465,40.946256,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.3585858585858586,"count":792},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Wayne, NJ"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/william-paterson-university-of-new-jersey/#scatterplot"}}]}
