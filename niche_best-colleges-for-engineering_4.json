They offer trips and movie nights which is all free for admitted students.\n\nEvery year they have \"week of welcome\" which consists of a lot of events. This year we had casino night,rock the rec, capture the flag and a glow in the dark paint party. Casino night was where we played black jack and poker. They also had a \"bar\" which consisted of virgin drinks. Rock the rec consisted of key logging, silent disco, glow in the dark dodgeball and rock climbing. We played capture the flag until 2am and last but not least, we had a huge rave paint party with an awesome DJ until close to midnight. \n\nClass wise, the classes aren't huge unlike UA or Auburn which is great for one on one time. My biggest class has 100 people in it and my smallest had around 20. It varies but still great class sizes. \n\nThe university of Alabama in Huntsville also offers FREE TUTORS!","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2017-09-09T14:32:58.677726Z","guid":"2f9373b5-71ee-49d9-b593-efc5e24c2233","rating":4},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":3.66}],"photos":{"default":{"crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/7ac6bae225c95ea161b599e812c6521aaa66b250.jpg","MobileHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/9714b0e200c1f8523104de5c4609e6ba53a82ac1.jpg"},"licenseName":"UNLICENSED"},"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-86.63842,34.722818,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-86.63842,34.722818,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.6296829971181555,"count":694},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Huntsville, AL"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/the-university-of-alabama-in-huntsville/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"76ef9c66-beb9-4ad6-b413-b995d78a9a4c","badge":{"display":"Best Colleges for Engineering in America","ordinal":79,"total":370,"vanityURL":"best-colleges-for-engineering"},"content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"University of Delaware","type":"College","url":"university-of-delaware"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.695},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":15894},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"1060-1280"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Senior","body":"This school provides me with countless opportunities to get involved with clubs that I'm interested in.

Extremely strict rules and regulations where violation for missed class or other minor offense may result in 5 hours punishment usually conducted in a physical manner such as marching.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2018-04-30T04:20:17.92536Z","guid":"6f6ba94d-f985-405c-9e2f-8f3764a7ccd3","rating":4},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":4}],"photos":{"default":{"crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/51e986c81df748188b50ed870393ebecffc7cbb6.jpg","MobileHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/3b21d23561fa817efb6037499fa79c553901ddf5.jpg"},"licenseName":"UNLICENSED"},"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-73.956804,41.390882,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-73.956804,41.390882,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.349090909090909,"count":275},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"West Point, NY"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/united-states-military-academy-at-west-point/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"0de4b9ec-961d-4915-8869-7496b5688f15","badge":{"display":"Best Colleges for Engineering in America","ordinal":82,"total":370,"vanityURL":"best-colleges-for-engineering"},"content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"Rochester Institute of Technology","type":"College","url":"rochester-institute-of-technology"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.5493},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":29111},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"1140-1330"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Freshman","body":"Rochester Institute of Technology was my dream college.

A lot of opportunities for internships, leadership positions and involvement. A lot of research opportunities and very good professors as well, especially for a public university. Despite the perception, OU is a lot more than just football and greek life. However, I would recommend that after freshman year, you live somewhere within walking distance to campus, because the parking here is absolutely awful and you will absolutely regret commuting to campus and spending nearly 2 hours looking for a parking spot everyday, even with a parking pass that costs hundreds of dollars. Also Dale Hall is a ridiculous building and if you have a class there, get there early because trying to make your way through the crowds in that building can sometimes take a while. The parking situation & Dale Hall is the only thing preventing me from giving this great school 5 stars.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2017-11-06T00:20:34.290457Z","guid":"75f25a4a-6e57-4df8-b0a2-0b3897295b1c","rating":4},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":4}],"photos":{"default":{"crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/6a7d7e2d5c708a009e6b4857db0d69cf2efb39c4.jpg","MobileHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/eeb1688e862a426894b97137be0e4145307a7a24.jpg","Thumbnail":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/0dfb8859200ebd86bfb0acaf4b7740bcc6822455"},"licenseName":"UNLICENSED"},"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-97.445692,35.208152,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-97.445692,35.208152,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.7810136157337366,"count":2644},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Norman, OK"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/university-of-oklahoma/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"887d7ed7-3a0a-429e-9cfd-96147fa5eb79","badge":{"display":"Best Colleges for Engineering in America","ordinal":90,"total":370,"vanityURL":"best-colleges-for-engineering"},"content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"University of Arkansas","type":"College","url":"university-of-arkansas"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.632},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":15411},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"1010-1220"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Freshman","body":"Life at the U of A is a dream! #1, Ben Rector went here and throws us free concerts! But on the real— campus is absolutely beautiful, especially to a girl from flat Texas like me! Fayetteville is utterly charming, and has something for everyone. With thousands of international students and its central location, the diversity is special and so treasured on this campus. I am never worried about making friends of different backgrounds, or finding my niche with those who share my cultural background because it happens so naturally. There are also plenty of religious groups to get plugged into on and around campus. My only complaint is the Hill, but it is worth it to live in Pomfret Hall with bigger bathrooms, a nice common area, and the dining hall which comes in handy on days of inclement weather. I truly love being a Razorback, and am so grateful to call Northwest Arkansas my second home.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2017-12-31T08:20:55.505021Z","guid":"743e04d5-da12-4e79-b8a9-e1fbbec69371","rating":5},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":4}],"photos":{"default":{"author":"mtnorton","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/5469a0f272cd5651b2fcfac357f368e9aedfee1b.jpg","MobileHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/c40b369d23ffb3ef5ca2388827b771cfcb22ef59.jpg","Thumbnail":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/a2ba338f9c416b38ba6a2ee45506047d4f0176e7"},"licenseName":"CC BY ","licenseUrl":"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/2.0/","sourceUrl":"https://www.flickr.com/photos/mtnorton/7212584262/"},"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-94.178214,36.06153,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-94.178214,36.06153,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.787639710716634,"count":3042},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Fayetteville, AR"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/university-of-arkansas/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"c2731dfa-36e9-438a-b5a1-5b5a783f9140","badge":{"display":"Best Colleges for Engineering in America","ordinal":91,"total":370,"vanityURL":"best-colleges-for-engineering"},"content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"University of Nebraska - Lincoln","type":"College","url":"university-of-nebraska---lincoln"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.7527},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":16462},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"990-1280"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Alum","body":"Attending UNL was a wonderful experience!

The positive (A)ttitudes that I surround myself with but also run into on campus has made for a welcoming ambient that even further radiates the Hawkeye pride!","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2018-03-17T01:11:11.643265Z","guid":"aba00c0c-42b5-465e-8d04-b340ca38e879","rating":4},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":4}],"photos":{"default":{"author":"tabor-roeder","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/06f730217444da73c4f7988f6ba78048c7a2a751","MobileHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/16e8a068343f2aa633556203f00fb79e4bc62d38","Thumbnail":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/1ec739738e7979b87ef4c2d621e99092628ab9a6"},"licenseName":"CC BY ","licenseUrl":"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/2.0/","sourceUrl":"https://www.flickr.com/photos/tabor-roeder/4450792306/"},"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-91.535698,41.660695,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-91.535698,41.660695,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.687720423212568,"count":3119},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Iowa City, IA"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/university-of-iowa/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"97fc2bba-189a-4252-9ce0-7631599e5ec5","badge":{"display":"Best Colleges for Engineering in America","ordinal":97,"total":370,"vanityURL":"best-colleges-for-engineering"},"content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"New York University","type":"College","url":"new-york-university"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.3187},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":35147},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"1250-1480"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Junior","body":"I love NYU!

Their engineering programs rival those of MIT, Georgia Tech, and CalPoly, boasting a blend of a traditional 4 year degree with a trade school environment. Students learn in small classroom settings (1:20) that cater to kinesthetic learners, some of whom have ADD, ADHD, or fall on the Autism spectrum. Freshmen are given invaluable opportunities building robots, satellites, and rockets in their first semester attending, and with the rigorous course load, offers students a 99% job place rate within one year after graduation. While ERAU has extensive educational prospects, this University is not for everyone. Students struggle feeling connected to the town, which is a retirement community. Even so, many ERAU employees are working with the city to build community bridges and bring more engineering businesses to Prescott for internship and job opportunities.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2018-03-29T04:01:45.820093Z","guid":"a795672f-46d3-412e-b302-fcb54eaaecaf","rating":4},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":3.33}],"photos":{"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-112.452285,34.615678,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-112.452285,34.615678,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.6611570247933884,"count":847},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Prescott, AZ"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/embry-riddle-aeronautical-university---prescott/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"7d6ee71f-baa4-41c3-91c7-b95a569cefcd","badge":{"display":"Best Colleges for Engineering in America","ordinal":99,"total":370,"vanityURL":"best-colleges-for-engineering"},"content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":true,"isPremium":false,"name":"Mississippi State University","type":"College","url":"mississippi-state-university"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.5567},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":15628},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"960-1260"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Junior","body":"Mississippi State University is such a wonderful college choice, for so many reasons. Prior to coming here, I was highly indecisive between Mississippi State and Ole Miss. After my first visit to MSU, I was completely in love with the academics, campus, and town! I will forever be a huge proponent for MSU, and everything that it has have to offer. MSU has offered me so much just in the two semesters I have been here. I am majoring in Kinesiology, and every single of one the professors in this department are so helpful, and truly want to watch each student succeed. The professors in this department are particularly wonderful in assisting their students to get into grad school. Additionally, I have had a number of ways to get involved and volunteer for different organizations.

However it does have some issues such as the inconsistent teacher quality and the fairly poor technical system. There are some seriously amazing teachers at the school but there are also some pretty bad ones. The first thing you want to do when you come to New Mexico Tech is ask some of the older students what teachers are the best for whatever classes you need. The technical part of almost everything at New Mexico Tech has some problems and you want to do as much as possible in person. Otherwise the building(save Torres) are pretty good and sturdy though Torres has some of the newer technology. Socorro itself is fairly barren but it has the base needs of a student body. overall its a good school but you need to know what you are doing before you make major decisions, as soon as you can ask your adviser for some introductory tips as the school does not really inform the students of what they need to do from time to time.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2017-08-16T15:32:03.555652Z","guid":"6a57d1b1-d24c-4db6-bb4e-dfb7955ea33c","rating":4},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":3.66}],"photos":{"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-106.907491,34.066035,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-106.907491,34.066035,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.497098646034816,"count":517},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Socorro, NM"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/new-mexico-institute-of-mining--and--technology/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"ad03b8e1-d0a1-41d6-a01a-aaf75ac1e615","badge":{"display":"Best Colleges for Engineering in America","ordinal":101,"total":370,"vanityURL":"best-colleges-for-engineering"},"content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"Scripps College","type":"College","url":"scripps-college"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.2988},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":37860},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"1290-1440"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Sophomore","body":"The food is great and lots of inspiring women!
