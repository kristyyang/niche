The professors are always available for outside of class help, and most of the professors try their best to make a relationship with each student.  The campus is beautiful and constantly undergoing new development and improvement.  Connecting with campus is seamless as each club and program is more than willing to accept new team members to help organize events and bring out the colonel spirit.   The events and programs on campus are almost all student lead  and developed, so all of the events benefit students of all backgrounds and interests.  There is always something to do on the weekends, and if nothing interests you specifically, their is always an opportunity for you to organize an event to reach out to students with the same interest; all with the support of whatever club/organization you choose to go through.  The campus is all about expanding its influence into the community and helping those in need.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2018-01-10T18:31:44.551923Z","guid":"5d5c0d01-e395-40c1-a999-4959f1d4455c","rating":5},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":3}],"photos":{"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-75.88833,41.243204,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-75.88833,41.243204,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.396414342629482,"count":502},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Wilkes-Barre, PA"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/wilkes-university/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"000bb920-cee5-4a1b-9a23-672b8abddac1","content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":true,"isPremium":true,"name":"Palm Beach Atlantic University","type":"College","url":"palm-beach-atlantic-university"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.9337},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":23444},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"930-1170"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Freshman","body":"Palm Beach Atlantic University is a Christian Private School dedicated to it's students.

Spring term at Union is still pretty lit though, given that we have ReUnion weekend, Lobster Fest, and Spring Fest. The social scene for the most part, given that Greek life makes up 70% of the student body (Union butchers this statistic as it includes freshman, even though you can't pledge until sophomore year) is getting blackout and going to an off campus party nowadays.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2016-12-22T18:45:44.991174Z","guid":"3f25e605-a90b-4599-8c44-58eda1d27e16","rating":4},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":4}],"photos":{"default":{"author":"jirka_matousek","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/1c50f212b43127310b4796fcdc08c4db170301ea.jpg","MobileHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/a085f7463737d2d7a537e43fac12c8fa2f8c5316.jpg","Thumbnail":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/ff1a2a9f6b4a027509cca9cc5f8c02efce604fcd"},"licenseName":"CC BY ","licenseUrl":"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/2.0/","sourceUrl":"https://www.flickr.com/photos/jirka_matousek/8374084149/"},"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-73.928498,42.817578,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-73.928498,42.817578,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.601923076923077,"count":520},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Schenectady, NY"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/union-college---new-york/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"6784c328-54ab-4dd3-bff7-e2b2c20bfd5e","content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"Luther College","type":"College","url":"luther-college"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.6763},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":25404},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"928-1198"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Freshman","body":"Luther College has a very friendly community atmosphere.The professors, and staff really care about their students, and encourage their success.

It's a big, beautiful family.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2018-05-10T17:12:58.005846Z","guid":"1f753bc3-d28a-40e8-bce2-e92cdb7accdf","rating":5},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":3}],"photos":{"default":{"crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/45cb79fe27fa02739f7ca4eb22b3a721c9ca4a45.jpg","MobileHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/d335a4b8bf95efce71fa4e813b48d3699ded5bc4.jpg"},"licenseName":"UNLICENSED"},"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-85.050878,35.049136,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-85.050878,35.049136,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.577524893314367,"count":703},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Collegedale, TN"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/southern-adventist-university/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"6504f1ee-d47c-44e5-a611-cf344b3effb9","content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"Lewis & Clark College","type":"College","url":"lewis--and--clark-college"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.5495},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":35849},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"1190-1370"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Senior","body":"The most obvious advantage about attending Lewis & Clark is that you get to learn and spend time on a gorgeous campus! The short walks between class are a pleasure every day. Moreover, I feel comfortable knowing I am getting an education from professors who have extensively studied the topics they teach. The small class sizes provide students with a close and trusting relationship with their professors. I feel extremely fortunate to have spent the past two years at Lewis & Clark.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2018-01-15T04:26:02.009834Z","guid":"3dd9b326-9f82-4bcf-b2fc-82ded7dfaaaf","rating":5},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":3.66}],"photos":{"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-122.672478,45.450547,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-122.672478,45.450547,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.548632218844985,"count":658},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Portland, OR"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/lewis--and--clark-college/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"3dac1572-8d55-4c8e-8f1d-6afd1556b42a","content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"University of Evansville","type":"College","url":"university-of-evansville"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.7089},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":22068},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"990-1220"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Junior","body":"I have loved my college experience here. The small class sizes, individualized courses, and professors who actually care about your success. While academics are very important, the campus offers a variety of activities to help get students involved. If we don't have a club or activity you want, the best part is you can create it!
