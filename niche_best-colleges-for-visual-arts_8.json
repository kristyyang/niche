Moving 18 hours away from home was extremely nerve-racking but Alabama could not feel more like home.

It is in a great area with many different things to do on and off campus. The professors love to teach and are very good! The class sizes are relatively small, so the learning experience is that much greater. Other students are very friendly and friends are always around!

You are directly in the middle of older, traditional buildings/grounds/architecture, but has the same amount of updated technology and resources. It makes for a perfectly balanced experience. While the campus is smaller than many other schools, there is no shortage of activities and social scenes (both alcohol and non) surrounding the area. It has the perfect mix of students: young/older, traditional/non-traditional, day/evening, and a wide variety of different backgrounds and lifestyles.\r\n\r\nI love the one-on-one experience and assistance that I have received from the faculty and staff at Carlow University. The professors are extremely kind and fair, easy to communicate with, and make every attempt to help their students succeed. Of course you have some students who say same professors are horrible, but those are usually the ones who do not do their work. Personally, I could not attend a school where I'm one little seat in a big theater, and only 1 out our 300 students. I need the more personalized atmosphere and connections.

Most teachers in that area did seem to care, but oftentimes I found they weren't able to teach the material quite as well as teachers in other areas. It would either be extremely difficult, with teachers going completely over my head, or very, very easy, with the teacher practically going back to basic high school math. It'd be nice to see some more focus on that area and to see it improve some.\nBut overall, this college has a very welcoming and warm environment and I'd recommend it to anyone looking for a good start to college. Just maybe don't come here if you want to be a math major.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2018-05-14T16:31:27.18293Z","guid":"b45e32d1-4501-4f01-a345-234a7cf1a0e9","rating":4},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":3.33}],"photos":{"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-83.231962,33.082787,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-83.231962,33.082787,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.6914529914529917,"count":1170},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Milledgeville, GA"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/georgia-college--and--state-university/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"362abb0c-db5a-4454-9775-f50a988c7c2e","content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"Miami University","type":"College","url":"miami-university"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.6538},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":20186},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"1130-1350"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Junior","body":"I love being a Miami student!

Miami alums are incredibly connected within the business world--we have countless alums that are CEOs, CMOs, etc. Additionally, we have a great fashion organization, MUF&D, that puts on the largest student-run fashion show in the US.

JMU offers so many organizations and clubs to join as well as fun activities for the whole campus to join in on.  The reason I didn't give JMU 5 stars is because there are some small difficulties that arise for me throughout the school year. For example, it is very difficult to register for classes and get all the classes you need to satisfy graduation requirements, especially as a freshman.  Also, because JMU is a smaller campus with a growing student population, there are always very long lines for food, for example, because they cannot cater to every single student.

I am enrolled in Teacher's College in the Elementary Education Program. I have had the privilege of building long-lasting relationships with classmates and outstanding professors in this program. All of my education classes have around 15-25 students in them. I personally love this class size because it allows me to create more meaningful and authentic relationships with my professor in a setting where I can have more one-on-one instruction if needed. With the encouragement and help of professors and my advisor on campus, I have been introduced to the opportunity to travel and teach in England for the summer. I am excited to announce that I have made the decision to study abroad! Without Ball State's professors and immersive learning opportunities, I would not be heading in the positive direction with my career that I am today. I am so thankful that I chose Ball State University to earn my degree in Elementary Education!","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2018-01-31T04:24:39.048489Z","guid":"6235b9f9-5f11-4a82-a535-43859d369e5c","rating":5},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":3.33}],"photos":{"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-85.408863,40.198942,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-85.408863,40.198942,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.5968968664435654,"count":3287},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Muncie, IN"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/ball-state-university/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"8dc5069d-4c07-44bb-8a9c-87cf178842ad","content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"Friends University","type":"College","url":"friends-university"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.5501},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":19644},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"850-1010"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Freshman","body":"If a person wants to grow in their spiritual path and journey with God while achieving the highest academics imaginable then friends is outstanding!
