This school offers a wide variety of organizations which focus on the different majors that can be obtained here. These include: psycology, natural sciences,social sciences, humanities, pedadogy, physical education, enterprise administration, among others. Also, most of the professors in this university are \"pro-student\"; which gives the whole professor/student relationship a new meaning. Sincerely, I would choose this school because it offers great education, a great faculty in a lot of departments and excellent opportunities in the graduate life.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2016-08-09T20:40:38Z","guid":"9f08bd1c-a064-4c1c-9643-8dd49ec5fd9c","rating":4},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade"}],"photos":{"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-66.163146,18.117232,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-66.163146,18.117232,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.575221238938053,"count":113},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Cayey, PR"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/university-of-puerto-rico---cayey/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"d1fc6227-52cd-45b0-a74d-1de59ac603a6","content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"Bethel University - Tennessee","type":"College","url":"bethel-university---tennessee"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.6652},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":14583},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"795-1060"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Sophomore","body":"The main thing that I like about Bethel University is that since it is in a small town you get the small town feel which is one that I am used to.

I am very thankful that it is because I play football here and during the fall we are away traveling and so I miss class a lot on Fridays. The teachers here are only wanting the best for you, all of the classes that I have taken here have been made a lot better because of that teachers that taught them.

Each of my instructors try to get to know their students in not only a learning stance, but personally too. On that note I enjoyed each class of mine, and they all consisted of a decent amount of learners who for the most part, were all there to earn a higher education. Two things that I would like changed is the amount of attention that is needed between the Advisors and Financial Aid. They both are major aspects to my learning, but I found that they both don’t know anything about each other so there was a lot of back and forth between offices I had to do.

AUM provide many opportunities to get involved on campus so that your voice can be heard. One of my favorite features that AUM is the learning resources.  They have many useful resources that can be used to get help outside of classes. If I had to change anything about Auburn University at Montgomery, I would change the food options and tuition fees. The food here is good, but also could be better.  As far as tuition, I think they should provide more scholarships for students who pay out of pocket. When choosing a college,   it is important to feel like you have made the best decision. At AUM, my decision, I believe hascollegbeen fulfilled. Overall, my experience at AUM has been non-complaint and decent.
