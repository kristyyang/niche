Tons of helpful information and assistance when needed in applying for financial aid.  Not the big campus run around from one office to the next.  Everything simplified!

I have successfully skipped one year of college and I am now a junior currently majoring in Aerospace Engineering. What’s more, Embry-Riddle has a scheme that lets you get your Master’s degree in the same field in a year! It is called the Accelerated Master’s Degree, which lets you take Graduate level classes in your senior year of your Bachelor’s degree.

Western has tons of opportunities to help you grow as a student and into an adult. There are so many Registered Student Organizations (RSO) on campus. I love that being a student on campus you can voice your opinions and feel comfortable doing so. There are places on campus for the LGBT community to go and feel safe! Western makes sure you can get the full experience and still learn.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2018-05-31T23:22:56.49844Z","guid":"3b5da4f7-ee68-4b64-98a7-66e6c3022d88","rating":5},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":3.33}],"photos":{"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-85.61512,42.282589,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-85.61512,42.282589,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.675547098001903,"count":3153},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Kalamazoo, MI"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/western-michigan-university/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"5397fb8a-dbb0-4bcd-8a6d-41da2249323d","badge":{"display":"Best Colleges in America","ordinal":624,"total":1644,"vanityURL":"best-colleges"},"content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"Minnesota State University, Mankato","type":"College","url":"minnesota-state-university-mankato"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.6249},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":13812},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"886-1106"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Sophomore","body":"I really enjoy all that the school has to offer in terms of extracurriculars.

The student life at CMU is great there's never not an activity going on, and if you don't want to stay on campus there many activities just minutes away from the CMU. Weather you like hiking, mountain biking, skiing, paddle boarding you name it then CMU is the right choice for you. And even if you've never done any of those thing CMU has a wonderful Outdoors program that will take you on trips and teach you the basics. Outdoors activites not for you that's okay we have a great rec gym with racquetball courts, basketball courts, rock climbing wall and even a Olympic size swimming pool.

For the most part the professors are great and very helpful, they really try their best to make sure their students succeed and understand what is going on. Their academic center is hands down great! They have FREE tutoring sessions throughout the week, including Saturday. All of these tutors have a degree and are VERY helpful. They have not only helped me become successful, but many other students their service. The classrooms are up to date and the campuses are very clean for the most part. I felt safe being on the main campus because of the amount of security on campus.

On that note I enjoyed each class of mine, and they all consisted of a decent amount of learners who for the most part, were all there to earn a higher education. Two things that I would like changed is the amount of attention that is needed between the Advisors and Financial Aid. They both are major aspects to my learning, but I found that they both don’t know anything about each other so there was a lot of back and forth between offices I had to do.
