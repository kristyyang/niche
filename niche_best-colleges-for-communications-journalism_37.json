One thing that I would like Midland to change is the food in the cafeteria. I would like to have healthier options such as salads, sandwiches, fruits, and other healthy foods.

Heidelberg's teachers are so amazing, with small class sizes they tend to each student and are easy to get one-on-one help. There is a very diverse population to our student organizations. Our unlimited access to our all-you-can-eat cafeteria makes it easy for healthy eating with fresh products and is very wide range of foods that cater to different diets.

It became a home to me! The campus is beautiful and perfectly placed close to town and other locations with fun events, and the people there are amazing, alongside the food which is always important to consider! Professors are great and willing to work with students during many times of the day, which also goes for the kitchen staff and the admissions office! The dorms are great and super cozy for a college! I miss spending time in the dorm buildings so much! I would do anything to put myself back there with the same group of people for one more night! Overall, I love Johnson State College and would highly recommend it for others!","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2018-02-16T04:48:42.468277Z","guid":"a0fc4231-b34d-4dfe-b7c5-7f6cf6e31ba7","rating":5},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":1.66}],"photos":{"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-72.671154,44.641736,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-72.671154,44.641736,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.1205211726384365,"count":307},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Johnson, VT"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/johnson-state-college/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"c9584630-215a-4aea-8774-0d72030880a3","content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"Rust College","type":"College","url":"rust-college"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.4686},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":9360},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"630-800"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Freshman","body":"My experience at Rust college has been very good so far as me being a current freshman in the first year experience program. The students and professors at rust college are helpful as far as helping to make sure the freshmen were to get to their classes. I can tell that the professors are teaching what the student needs to learn, my classes so far are going very well. Also, I know where to go if I need anything fixed or check out, Rust College has a very Mass Communication program. But I really like the way Rust College students and professors get their business and class assignments done.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2017-09-28T21:37:02.494691Z","guid":"45ed8afc-ae97-4318-b646-7d82b216794e","rating":5},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":2}],"photos":{"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-89.446999,34.776862,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-89.446999,34.776862,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.110497237569061,"count":181},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Holly Springs, MS"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/rust-college/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"e2821977-d754-4dee-84fc-f8d6628c1c28","content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":true,"isPremium":false,"name":"Mary Baldwin University","type":"College","url":"mary-baldwin-university"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.9948},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":18543},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"860-1080"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Sophomore","body":"Mary Baldwin University, what could I say in order to give you a picture of campus life.
