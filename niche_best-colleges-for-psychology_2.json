By that, I mean that it's smaller than my high school. To be quite honest, there really isn't much to do within the town of Davidson, and without a car, Charlotte isn't exactly accessible. I knew all too well of this, but I still decided to come here because Davidson genuinely is an amazing school. Professors are very engaged with their students and I can definitely see how passionate they are about the courses they teach. Class sizes are great as well, with several of my classes having fewer than 15 students and none over ~30.

When I first came to Claremont McKenna, I feared that it would be difficult to make friends as it is such a small school. However, the first day shocked me completely. Everyone was so freaking nice, like unbelievably nice. In the last 3 months of being here, I know about 250/360 kids in my class, and of course a lot of upperclassmen. The party scene here is exactly what I want from a school ,inclusivity, but everyone definitely shares a work hard, play hard mentality. We know how to party, but we also know how to be the scholarly students we got in here for being. The party scene truly is spectacular. The dining hall food is amazing. Sports teams are great as 1/3 of the student body participates in sports There are pretty much a million ways to get involved on campus. I want to continue rambling about how much I love it here, but I also have an econ quiz tomorrow, but I hope that helps.

Because it is a private Ivy-league school, all smart and mostly above middle class students gather around school networks, which I assume will be very powerful for future career.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2017-09-25T13:31:40.244087Z","guid":"d77c63b8-18a4-4b94-905a-7557fc69066f","rating":4},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":4.33}],"photos":{"default":{"author":"upsand","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/19cbfe96549e0a2f72fb73b95192401c29c53f9a.jpg","MobileHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/8ba1cace2e9f604d188811f48e30cd9d23c07e63.jpg","Thumbnail":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/d520c50b02dbd15e4aec7320c47ac53384314ba5"},"licenseName":"CC BY ","licenseUrl":"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/2.0/","sourceUrl":"https://www.flickr.com/photos/upsand/438380547/"},"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-76.48269,42.445291,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-76.48269,42.445291,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.6823793490460157,"count":1782},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Ithaca, NY"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/cornell-university/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"bc6f707c-da0e-4db1-b06f-ebfe9473423b","badge":{"display":"Best Colleges for Psychology in America","ordinal":32,"total":993,"vanityURL":"best-colleges-for-psychology"},"content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":true,"isPremium":false,"name":"Johns Hopkins University","type":"College","url":"johns-hopkins-university"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.1284},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":27352},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"1400-1570"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Graduate Student","body":"I am a first year graduate student in their online Museum Studies program.

Find a place that feels like home, because it will become just that.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2018-05-07T20:21:56.171857Z","guid":"4c6fac8a-21e0-47b7-af85-cf5201a28535","rating":5},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":4.33}],"photos":{"default":{"crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/e392de297d5c0217fa9163e34be17ba2dbb7a3c5.jpg","MobileHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/beb6eae11f106ef55eec6ee45c4cf304a6650c00.jpg","Thumbnail":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/3498b09544f1ae199377093a18adba8c7514853e"},"licenseName":"UNLICENSED"},"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-76.709395,37.27195,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-76.709395,37.27195,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.572655690765927,"count":1397},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Williamsburg, VA"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/college-of-william--and--mary/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"ad03b8e1-d0a1-41d6-a01a-aaf75ac1e615","badge":{"display":"Best Colleges for Psychology in America","ordinal":39,"total":993,"vanityURL":"best-colleges-for-psychology"},"content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"Scripps College","type":"College","url":"scripps-college"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.2988},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":37860},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"1290-1440"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Sophomore","body":"The food is great and lots of inspiring women!

Students and faculty provide a welcoming and intellectually stimulating environment.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2018-04-30T18:24:12.118417Z","guid":"3979bce1-4a72-4984-a22f-6ce6adb8a9c5","rating":5},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":4.33}],"photos":{"default":{"author":"37872410@N00","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/0dde5c37005810ba6f797b283f6820d2813e7408.jpg","MobileHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/c14b924b2400eabe99e0ac103117b46c96654463.jpg","Thumbnail":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/0db595934d04c81d85e41f4f272735798157d8c3"},"licenseName":"CC BY ","licenseUrl":"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/2.0/","sourceUrl":"https://www.flickr.com/photos/37872410@N00/16366192994/"},"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-84.325782,33.798836,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-84.325782,33.798836,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.7656579873328644,"count":1421},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Atlanta, GA"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/emory-university/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"a0da9562-a209-49c5-af5d-fd157a9441a3","badge":{"display":"Best Colleges for Psychology in America","ordinal":46,"total":993,"vanityURL":"best-colleges-for-psychology"},"content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"Wesleyan University","type":"College","url":"wesleyan-university"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.1785},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":20490},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"1300-1480"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Alum","body":"Wesleyan's professors make the school.

I loved Middlebury for the blend of high caliber academics, a hardworking student body, and a focus on active, healthy lifestyles. Students at Middlebury balance work and play, and a weekend was never without hours in the library or miles of hiking, running or biking. The teachers have high expectations for your work, but they understand there's more to get out of college than acing every exam. As I tour college campuses today, I look for candidates who strike that same balance, who take their work seriously, but they don't take themselves too seriously.
