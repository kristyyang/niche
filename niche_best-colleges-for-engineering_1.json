Here are they:\n1. My first choice is chemical engineering and I always adored to conduct researches in laboratories. Therefore, when I applied to colleges first of all I looked if they have a good undergraduate research opportunities. In MIT with the help UROP I could start researching even from freshman class.\n2. Its pass no record style of educating freshmen. There is no grading in the first semester. Instead, one gets \"Pass\" or \"Fail\" in his or her transcript. It allows students not to stress too much on grades, but explore the university and majors.\n3. Of course it is the best university in the field of chemical engineering. Top notch professors, smart peers and the best laboratories makes MIT unique.\n4. It's financially available for all international students. MIT's need blind policy makes it affordable for all who want to attend it.\n\nI hope it helps!","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2017-12-28T19:46:12.988166Z","guid":"6a2f1b8a-1afe-4ef8-944b-b2dd08d2ab87","rating":5},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":4.33}],"photos":{"default":{"author":"justinjensen","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/9e4d828e5f5cfe5eac16bdee876a58919082288f.jpg","MobileHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/3dbd39d4c1401beb7773c38566cc4d728d7db4ed.jpg","Thumbnail":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/557facfa37e7e3a49d452635d811fd839d0145b2"},"licenseName":"CC BY ","licenseUrl":"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/2.0/","sourceUrl":"https://www.flickr.com/photos/justinjensen/4979561102/in/album-72157623671307590/"},"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-71.092115,42.360095,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-71.092115,42.360095,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":4.078859060402684,"count":596},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Cambridge, MA"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/massachusetts-institute-of-technology/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"e3c7da9f-a6d3-4951-bfbb-6049c2ac56e2","badge":{"display":"Best Colleges for Engineering in America","ordinal":2,"total":370,"vanityURL":"best-colleges-for-engineering"},"content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"Stanford University","type":"College","url":"stanford-university"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.0481},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":16695},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"1380-1580"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Freshman","body":"Stanford is a beautiful, welcoming place where everyone is welcome!

The Princeton Environmental institute does classes with local farmers using a variety of methods and chefs from many culinary backgrounds.\n\nWhat I like most about Princeton is the community.

Because Georgia Tech is a world-class campus, the opportunities offered to the students are many and are also well-funded for those who do not have a lot of money themselves. Because of this, over half of the student body participates in a program of campus before they graduate, which will normally be things like an internship, co-op, or studying abroad.

The people are so friendly and collaborative, and the residential college system gives you an automatic support system and built-in friends/family. While people are smart, the atmosphere is close-knit and not cutthroat, which I've come to realize is hugely important when I hear my friends at other top universities talk about the pressure and competition they suffer through. The academics aren't easy- especially the STEM programs, which are structured to be some of the most rigorous in the country, but that's why we have such a good reputation and ease with post-graduation placements. Compared to other colleges, there's a lot of freedom with social life/partying and distribution requirements. Overall, the campus is beautiful and quality of life (dorms/food/area) very high.

I cannot begin to tell you the opportunities available here nor what you will learn from working and studying alongside people from all over the world. Harvard also tries to promote diversity further by offering a needs-blind application process and a financial aid package that guarantees you will not have to turn down your acceptance due to financial hardship!

I will actually be going to Costa Rica this summer to help in rainforest restoratuon and conservation through this  program!But what I truly love most about this school is its students. The atmosphere here is not competitive but collaborative. I came to Duke feeling insecure about my qualifications compared to those of the other incoming freshman.

It’s not necessary to be Catholic and people who aren’t religious at all won’t feel excluded, but it is especially amazing for people who are religious. I myself am not very religious but was raised in the faith and do appreciate it, so I enjoyed being around it and taking the required Theology and Philosophy courses. Everyone is extremely nice and collaborative! Very smart people here and caring professors. Single sex dorms is a negative as well as less opportunities for medical professions, as there is no hospital or medical focus here. I would say it’s best for business, engineering, or liberal arts.

The physics department is particularly impressive, except for its distinct lack of coffee (it's time: get a cafe in/near Loomis already).","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2018-04-29T05:27:03.992779Z","guid":"3d055a45-3d23-42f6-a4eb-65bda8f2a411","rating":4},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":4.33}],"photos":{"default":{"author":"vsmithuk","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/3bd07b7ad6f7539602b686c397574b5df9aedcbd.jpg","MobileHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/a3ceb931e74031ade74565eea2d1d30c9ee4e770.jpg","Thumbnail":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/0ec9783e6ecefa67c0081d4d083fbd2ec39cb2d8"},"licenseName":"CC BY ","licenseUrl":"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/2.0/","sourceUrl":"https://www.flickr.com/photos/vsmithuk/370812598/"},"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-88.230309,40.108864,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-88.230309,40.108864,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.68393536121673,"count":4208},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Champaign, IL"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/university-of-illinois-at-urbana-champaign/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"8a41db38-a2bb-4999-991b-cb37387781d7","badge":{"display":"Best Colleges for Engineering in America","ordinal":20,"total":370,"vanityURL":"best-colleges-for-engineering"},"content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":true,"isPremium":true,"name":"Vanderbilt University","type":"College","url":"vanderbilt-university"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.1075},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":23150},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"1420-1590"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Graduate Student","body":"I am admitted to the school of nursing in preparation mode for classes to begin.

For instance, I am a double major in Government and International Relations and Global Studies and am continuously amazed at the amount of programs, events, lectures , courses, and books available just for students in those majors. Your college's department of Career Services will blow you away as well, they will provide any and all resources to ensure your success after graduation.
