There are always opportunities to get involved and get active on campus. If you show effort, the teachers will meet you half way. They are very willing and open to assistance. My academic adviser is the absolute best. I am comfortable going to see her about anything whether it is school related or not. I was proactive about scheduling so for me, it was easy to get the classes I wanted at the times I wanted. However, they have yet to begin online registration methods but word around is that we should have it for next fall. One set back is that the business office and financial aid offices are not very efficient and are not always on the same page. I had to keep going back and talking with both of them to get one simple thing done that turned out to be a slack on their part. Also, there seems to be some unnecessary general education classes, but that is expected being though that this is a Christian, private school. Other than that I have had a fine time here. I like the small campus and class setting, so this was a good pick for me.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2016-02-09T01:02:59Z","guid":"c5013cc6-c0dd-458c-9831-6d438a8e25a3","rating":4},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":2}],"photos":{"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-77.774231,36.017443,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-77.774231,36.017443,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.450980392156863,"count":204},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Rocky Mount, NC"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/north-carolina-wesleyan-college/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"129bd00f-1fe2-4789-b1ab-0043cf7a6f9b","content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"Faulkner University","type":"College","url":"faulkner-university"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.4538},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":19877},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"880-1120"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Sophomore","body":"Faulkner University is a Christian based school where Christianity is exemplified in the character of their professors and staff.

This is my freshman year at the school in my second semester. I'm majoring in computer science, a great field, this school is a great opportunity. The professors are terrific and they help you a lot especially with tutoring if needed. Staff and faculty are amazing people. Very friendly campus!","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2017-01-02T23:12:57.275992Z","guid":"1f8a8e4e-7a65-41b1-83ae-210519da273d","rating":5},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade"}],"photos":{"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-96.978193,28.816438,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-96.978193,28.816438,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.6397379912663754,"count":458},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Victoria, TX"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/university-of-houston---victoria/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"fc2c6888-3641-4b6f-a1cf-8f3e7cf5811d","content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"Becker College","type":"College","url":"becker-college"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.6534},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":30485},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"920-1130"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Freshman","body":"I am a freshman, but I've been on campus a few times these past months. The professors are incredibly helpful with helping me adjust seeing that I'm not from here or the area. They have a wide variety of foods, all heathey and delicious. They even have options for vegans and vegetarians which is great because nobody likes eating plain salad everyday! The dorms are comfortable and it seems like everyone here is super open minded. I have yet to meet someone who discriminates against me or my equals.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2017-07-20T15:44:42.639617Z","guid":"2950b93e-64b8-47ce-9999-88d9127abecd","rating":5},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":2}],"photos":{"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-71.811895,42.26918,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-71.811895,42.26918,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.555555555555556,"count":360},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Worcester, MA"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/becker-college/#scatterplot"}}]}
