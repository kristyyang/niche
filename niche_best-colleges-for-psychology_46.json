Although they need to work on the cafe food, they have renovated a lot of the buildings and more plans to continue. The area is great, it's close to downtown Asheville and other places and the views almost everywhere are so gorgeous! The professors are very good depending on your major. One of the major problems is when you try to transfer credits, Mars hill doesn't do a good job with transferring credits in or out. They are big on athletics and over half of the student population are athletes. I give Mars hill a thumbs up because I've thoroughly enjoyed my experience here and I would recommend this school to others!","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2017-03-10T17:30:17.315285Z","guid":"3f015577-a6f5-4fc9-819a-57855e8bca24","rating":4},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":2.33}],"photos":{"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-82.550859,35.825858,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-82.550859,35.825858,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.2576923076923077,"count":520},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Mars Hill, NC"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/mars-hill-university/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"b61894f0-0946-4ae9-ab8a-26ed2f085f91","content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"Notre Dame College","type":"College","url":"notre-dame-college"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.9025},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":21818},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"820-995"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Freshman","body":"Coming into NDC I had heard mixed reviews.

First and foremost the university prides itself on the achievement of academic excellence for its entire student body. The curriculum is varied, interesting and is engineered to maximize the character and well roundedness of its students. This quality of academic achievement is made possible only by an attentive and caring faculty of professors, many of which are expert in their respective fields. Student life at the university is also exceptional. All incoming students are welcomed warmly. The helpfulness of the staff is remarkable considering the fact that each professor is ready and willing to sit one on one with students for discussion. One shortcoming of the university, however, is that, even with its veritable course selection, it offers but one foreign language, that being Spanish. Personally I would have enjoyed a more wide ranging selection of languages.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2017-06-05T19:42:51.155873Z","guid":"52fe6210-a473-4984-9805-bb0f61271409","rating":4},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":3}],"photos":{"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-84.640143,39.094519,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-84.640143,39.094519,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.464968152866242,"count":314},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Cincinnati, OH"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/mount-st-joseph-university/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"be87d8ff-7241-44bd-8302-e74a24797053","content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"Saint Joseph's College of Maine","type":"College","url":"saint-josephs-college-of-maine"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.7808},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":24875},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"810-1020"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Sophomore","body":"Although the campus is extremely small, it has its perks!

My experience at Regis has been amazing, and I am very thankful for the support they have provided me with.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2018-04-28T14:35:40.374614Z","guid":"13b8c48d-cd05-44c9-83c9-9f2dae9af658","rating":5},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":2.33}],"photos":{"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-71.309126,42.351105,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-71.309126,42.351105,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.287581699346405,"count":306},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Weston, MA"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/regis-college/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"1abdb91c-a3c3-4b50-9d2c-0d7464c67b42","content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"Lyndon State College","type":"College","url":"lyndon-state-college"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.9834},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":15587},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"840-1060"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Junior","body":"What I loved about Lyndon State College was that the student to professor ratio was 15-20:1. The professors are willing to work one-on-one and help you succeed. There is many resources available such as tutors, and the academic support center which helps students prioritize, schedule classes, and learn how to effectively study. The academics are optimal and require professionalism and the programs expect high quality, to their best effort out of the students. The community is very open and willing to help anybody. Lyndon gives the opportunity for students to be an athlete while having their main focus on school then sports after. There is many activities to do on campus from student life scheduling opportunities. Activities off campus also includes skiing, hiking, etc. Lyndon provides the optimal opportunity for school and fun, all while receivin the college experience.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2017-12-27T17:32:30.395408Z","guid":"05283d51-b253-4fbb-87ce-3c7896280321","rating":4},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":2.33}],"photos":{"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-72.024563,44.53433,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-72.024563,44.53433,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.34,"count":250},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Lyndonville, VT"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/lyndon-state-college/#scatterplot"}}]}
