Professors are very engaged and genuinely care about the students. Very small class sizes, which creates a close-knit environment. The tuition is high, but it is a very good quality education. One complaint is the meal plan. There are currency 3 different meal plan options. They differ in the number of meals per week and amount of DBD's usable in the campus cafe'. However, each meal plan is the same cost! You cannot get a cheaper meal plan until you move out of the regular dorm.  The meal plans are expensive. Overall, great college!

Upon reading this, you may seem a bit skeptical seeing as how its an \"Assemblies of God\" campus which in your mind is summed up as \"reserved, strict, and overall an anti-'good time' living.\" However, although the University are somewhat strict and frowns upon most cases of going out partying and drinking and has a curfew during the academic year, the atmosphere on each of the halls I wouldn't describe as anything less than family-like.

Also, I will never get tired of saying this... Everyone is nice. Texas Wesleyan is a diverse, fun and successful University.

Its a close knit school and very friendly csmpus. Academics are very good with small class sizes.  My daughter, who is African American, has made friends of all sorts and is involved in a lot. Sure, it does not have the big school sports scene but the college was top ranked in division two in severals sports. Security seems tight so far and there's a real emphasis on community service. If you want a school where the student will not get lost in a crowd and will get a very good foundation, Rockhurst is an under the radar gem with well respected academics as with most Jesuit colleges. Its not a commuter school even though its in an urban area. Campus is beautiful and not urban looking at all.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2017-08-26T05:03:14.500932Z","guid":"d2dcfbca-2735-4506-a1cb-af03240d0215","rating":5},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":3.66}],"photos":{"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-94.571249,39.030843,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-94.571249,39.030843,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.589080459770115,"count":348},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Kansas City, MO"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/rockhurst-university/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"153cdf09-dd98-4486-ae67-6155b5c7683c","content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"Loras College","type":"College","url":"loras-college"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.9236},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":17958},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"938-1246"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Freshman","body":"I have been here for less than a year but I am already blown away by how much I love the school!
