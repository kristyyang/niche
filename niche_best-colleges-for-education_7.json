If you're used to culture or seeing people of color in your community back home, Spokane will be a culture shock.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2018-02-20T17:50:13.182571Z","guid":"94ffcc96-48bc-42c3-a405-66f77a5af6f4","rating":4},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":3.66}],"photos":{"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-117.403062,47.668144,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-117.403062,47.668144,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.689873417721519,"count":1106},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Spokane, WA"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/gonzaga-university/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"d2661dbb-1f27-4182-9053-51b4fb5e9060","badge":{"display":"Best Colleges for Education in America","ordinal":165,"total":756,"vanityURL":"best-colleges-for-education"},"content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"Arizona State University - West Campus","type":"College","url":"arizona-state-university---west-campus"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.7786},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":8692},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"960-1168"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Freshman","body":"I really love Arizona State University's West campus.

For example, the student center has over four different restaurants and the workers are nice.

I am excited for the my future career in Physical Therapy, and I know that Eastern University is preparing me well to serve others with physical impairments.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2018-06-03T19:48:00.077831Z","guid":"8cbd73ba-b8e2-43ba-9d1f-69e7fd446a10","rating":4},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":3}],"photos":{"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-75.370268,40.052306,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-75.370268,40.052306,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.5798657718120803,"count":745},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Saint Davids, PA"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/eastern-university/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"4419c2e8-24f5-43f2-aff5-fa70b1063be4","badge":{"display":"Best Colleges for Education in America","ordinal":175,"total":756,"vanityURL":"best-colleges-for-education"},"content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"Saint Mary's College - Indiana","type":"College","url":"saint-marys-college---indiana"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.8165},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":25991},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"980-1160"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Sophomore","body":"I recently just transferred here, and so far its been great!

The campus is small and well kept, and the food is decent (for being college cafeteria food). The housing is not exactly state of the art, but it is safe and well-kept. The classes are small, allowing for more personalized attention from professors. The campus is very involved, with plenty of groups and activities for all types of people. While being a non-denominational Christian college that requires some religious courses, the faculty and staff do not ostracize or penalize anyone for choosing another path in life. The only downsides to the college are the location (Kansas has little to do, and small town Kansas has less) and the cost. The private school is fairly expensive to attend. However, all things considered, it is definitely a worthwhile college to look into as an upcoming freshman in college.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2017-05-31T00:55:00.195287Z","guid":"6740e85b-57b2-474c-93c3-84fc02af5020","rating":4},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":2.66}],"photos":{"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-98.209966,38.219783,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-98.209966,38.219783,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.488262910798122,"count":213},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Sterling, KS"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/sterling-college---kansas/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"3d1379fe-e2a4-41e7-b0dc-87a59efe31b5","badge":{"display":"Best Colleges for Education in America","ordinal":180,"total":756,"vanityURL":"best-colleges-for-education"},"content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"University of Southern Mississippi","type":"College","url":"university-of-southern-mississippi"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.6014},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":11916},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"940-1190"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Freshman","body":"University was an adjustment for me, but USM is amazing.

Already working full-time the summer after graduation thanks to Asbury networking. I can't say enough about how great Asbury is. God is a part of Asbury and will be close to anyone trying to find him while you go to school here. I've grown spiritually while attending and intellectually. There are school parties almost every weekend and fun things/ events to go to.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2017-07-25T17:50:44.795514Z","guid":"413df746-18e2-4d58-8cfb-0db758da9839","rating":5},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":3.33}],"photos":{"default":{"crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/25b50e31ae292cf156d525095dc9e45f13838982.jpg","MobileHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/b1b2fa2f10c2da1ec6cd0516f4bdcf6f7d78f1a3.jpg"},"licenseName":"UNLICENSED"},"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-84.662606,37.862029,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-84.662606,37.862029,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.798469387755102,"count":392},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Wilmore, KY"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/asbury-university/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"83fdeea4-e9d4-42c3-b96a-5fe852f06a3a","badge":{"display":"Best Colleges for Education in America","ordinal":184,"total":756,"vanityURL":"best-colleges-for-education"},"content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"Marquette University","type":"College","url":"marquette-university"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.8434},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":33502},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"1040-1270"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Niche User","body":"My college visit was an amazing experience! Everyone was very helpful and caring. All of my questions were answered and I am in love with the school. The location is perfect with having a urban lifestyle with suburban people. The campus is located only 1 mile away from Lake Michigan for summer fun and there are also numerous activities that can be done during the summer months, such as going to their D1 basketball team. Everyone has great school spirit and safety is tremendous since they have an almost 24 hour limo service that will ensure that you make it back to your dorm after a cheer-filled game or long night of studying in their wonderful library.    I recommend everyone looking into this college when they are applying.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2018-01-01T19:42:26.362584Z","guid":"9c3f07e7-6513-490c-b660-968f4077529f","rating":5},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":4}],"photos":{"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-87.928121,43.038766,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-87.928121,43.038766,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.5583377730420884,"count":1877},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Milwaukee, WI"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/marquette-university/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"090fbe90-f532-4e8f-b86b-45495372cce4","badge":{"display":"Best Colleges for Education in America","ordinal":185,"total":756,"vanityURL":"best-colleges-for-education"},"content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"University of Northern Colorado","type":"College","url":"university-of-northern-colorado"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.9027},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":13065},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"928-1150"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Freshman","body":"My name is Lauren Espinoza and it is my first year at the University of Northern Colorado and so far it has been blissful! Coming into college is a big step up, which can be stressful, scary and exciting  all at once. UNC, does an extraordinary job at welcoming incoming students. From exposing you to all activities, clubs, etc. that are provided to filling you with important information necessary to help you transition. I enjoy very much how I feel like I am at home at UNC. Everyone, is very helpful, joyful, energetic and funny. I know that I can count on anybody around campus even though I may not know them. There is a variety of places for one to eat, find resources and places to study and do homework. All races, ethnicities, and cultures are presented throughout the country, allowing us to share and experience from one another.Definitely, a perfect match for me and would not want to change a thing.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2018-02-02T00:20:25.186561Z","guid":"dc27a867-d32f-4fc7-80bb-6f5313bafebe","rating":5},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":3}],"photos":{"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-104.701721,40.403178,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-104.701721,40.403178,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.532441802872709,"count":2019},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Greeley, CO"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/university-of-northern-colorado/#scatterplot"}}]}
