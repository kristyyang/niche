Therefore, when I applied to colleges first of all I looked if they have a good undergraduate research opportunities. In MIT with the help UROP I could start researching even from freshman class.\n2. Its pass no record style of educating freshmen. There is no grading in the first semester. Instead, one gets \"Pass\" or \"Fail\" in his or her transcript. It allows students not to stress too much on grades, but explore the university and majors.\n3. Of course it is the best university in the field of chemical engineering. Top notch professors, smart peers and the best laboratories makes MIT unique.\n4. It's financially available for all international students. MIT's need blind policy makes it affordable for all who want to attend it.\n\nI hope it helps!","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2017-12-28T19:46:12.988166Z","guid":"6a2f1b8a-1afe-4ef8-944b-b2dd08d2ab87","rating":5},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":4.33}],"photos":{"default":{"author":"justinjensen","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/9e4d828e5f5cfe5eac16bdee876a58919082288f.jpg","MobileHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/3dbd39d4c1401beb7773c38566cc4d728d7db4ed.jpg","Thumbnail":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/557facfa37e7e3a49d452635d811fd839d0145b2"},"licenseName":"CC BY ","licenseUrl":"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/2.0/","sourceUrl":"https://www.flickr.com/photos/justinjensen/4979561102/in/album-72157623671307590/"},"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-71.092115,42.360095,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-71.092115,42.360095,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":4.078859060402684,"count":596},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Cambridge, MA"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/massachusetts-institute-of-technology/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"34af6312-6f20-4d90-b512-ac5cd720ab25","badge":{"display":"Best Colleges for Business in America","ordinal":4,"total":1020,"vanityURL":"best-colleges-for-business"},"content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"Georgetown University","type":"College","url":"georgetown-university"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.1685},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":26625},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"1320-1520"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Sophomore","body":"After my first year here, I'm absolutely certain that Georgetown is the place for me. Because social -- and often intellectual -- life centers around student organizations, I've had the chance to meet people who share my passions. In lieu of Greek life, student organizations host parties that foster a sense of community that centers around something deeper than hazing or a few Greek letters. The professors are caring and encourage you to think for yourself. Another thing I want to emphasize is the effect of Jesuit values. I was hesitant about them coming in because I'm not religious, but Georgetown doesn't shove religion down your throat. Rather, the school makes a concerted and largely successful effort to instill Jesuit values into all aspects of the community, such as the values of empathy, care, and intellectual risk-taking.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2018-05-30T01:34:22.337211Z","guid":"978b0f5f-2601-433d-8a81-599a051a623f","rating":5},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":4.33}],"photos":{"default":{"author":"bootbearwdc","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/12abac16c83fda20334b5c577c5b4ec014e75704.jpg","MobileHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/120f5736f8423c08516a76bf1a3fd36cc3ebf457.jpg","Thumbnail":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/47a9f5b83376225e5d4b4f612ef47b38724d2850"},"licenseName":"CC BY ","licenseUrl":"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/2.0/","sourceUrl":"https://www.flickr.com/photos/bootbearwdc/57647301/"},"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-77.073463,38.908809,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-77.073463,38.908809,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.7115559599636034,"count":1099},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Washington, DC"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/georgetown-university/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"2c83ac29-32ae-479e-ba62-a60b2380c691","badge":{"display":"Best Colleges for Business in America","ordinal":5,"total":1020,"vanityURL":"best-colleges-for-business"},"content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"Washington University in St. Louis","type":"College","url":"washington-university-in-st-louis"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.1653},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":28824},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"1400-1570"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Senior","body":"WashU has opened up a lot of doors for me in terms of career exploration and pursuit.

It’s not necessary to be Catholic and people who aren’t religious at all won’t feel excluded, but it is especially amazing for people who are religious. I myself am not very religious but was raised in the faith and do appreciate it, so I enjoyed being around it and taking the required Theology and Philosophy courses. Everyone is extremely nice and collaborative! Very smart people here and caring professors. Single sex dorms is a negative as well as less opportunities for medical professions, as there is no hospital or medical focus here. I would say it’s best for business, engineering, or liberal arts.

From political to adventurous student organizations, to meeting the very brightest professors and students in your chosen field, you will never cease to be amazed by the unlimited amount of opportunities available to you. For instance, I am a double major in Government and International Relations and Global Studies and am continuously amazed at the amount of programs, events, lectures , courses, and books available just for students in those majors. Your college's department of Career Services will blow you away as well, they will provide any and all resources to ensure your success after graduation. Most of all, UT is a highly respected university in the state of Texas and beyond, a degree from UT will go a very long way!

The professors are hard working and qualified, the people are friendly, there are a lot of kids from all over the world, and the campus is awesome! Most students come to Northeastern because of the co-op program which is the most significant part of the university.

Additionally, with thousands of clubs, there are plenty of ways to get involved. On another note, there are many stereotypes of people who come to the University, but I promise that not all of us are preppy, rich, and white, though a good portion is. The only problems I have with UVA are the prices of tuition and the honor code. Tuition is expensive and instead of giving grants UVA sometimes gives a lot of loans.

Wasn't convinced at the time (wanted to be in NYC) but it's a good place to go to school - enough to do, fairly safe, pretty cheap to live, plenty of arts and culture if you want it, decent food, etc.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2017-03-13T11:15:56.240234Z","guid":"df7737e7-ed6e-4f5d-98f2-98b597aa87f2","rating":4},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":4.33}],"photos":{"default":{"crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/26f58f82eaaef86dd7fbb0581d7023548e81efee.jpg","MobileHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/69601a778e428a6e6dedb34fcb0e2643dbcca6f6.jpg"},"licenseName":"UNLICENSED"},"mapbox_header":{"crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-79.942914,40.444616,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-79.942914,40.444616,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"UNLICENSED"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.6399099774943737,"count":1333},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Pittsburgh, PA"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/carnegie-mellon-university/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"5712b0c1-3a40-4ea1-a324-9c4f76fefd10","badge":{"display":"Best Colleges for Business in America","ordinal":19,"total":1020,"vanityURL":"best-colleges-for-business"},"content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill","type":"College","url":"university-of-north-carolina-at-chapel-hill"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.2694},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":10077},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"1210-1420"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Sophomore","body":"UNC is a special place which I am proud to call my home.

The campus is beautiful, but there is always construction. It is not a huge party school, but there are parties and lots of other ways to have fun. I loved the proximity to Chicago and the public transit system. Overall, I liked the student body. There was a general hard work ethic, and though my majors weren't particularly competitive, I know there were some that were fairly cut-throat.

Plus, the food is great!","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2018-02-26T00:32:00.7338Z","guid":"205edd72-1cb4-4f6c-975b-b6c1df4313c5","rating":5},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":4.33}],"photos":{"default":{"author":"billdamon","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/abba88494b389782ce90a7174f73e4383a483010.jpg","MobileHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/f38939147f7db0c417f687c3ed7f2d20431aa5e9.jpg","Thumbnail":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/cd4e48b6121d0de72722fb18482dd9e46d5d20e9"},"licenseName":"CC BY ","licenseUrl":"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/2.0/","sourceUrl":"https://www.flickr.com/photos/billdamon/14010939333/"},"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-71.171488,42.337688,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-71.171488,42.337688,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.575912408759124,"count":1370},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Chestnut Hill, MA"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/boston-college/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"fed9be26-518d-4a71-ba22-cd4ad1066ffb","badge":{"display":"Best Colleges for Business in America","ordinal":25,"total":1020,"vanityURL":"best-colleges-for-business"},"content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"University of Wisconsin","type":"College","url":"university-of-wisconsin"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.5262},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":15874},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"1200-1420"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Sophomore","body":"I'm only through two years at the UW, but they've been awesome so far! Football season is great, really brings the city together, especially fresh off of an Orange Bowl win. It took some adjusting living away from my family, but I've made some great friends in Madison. I had a great roommate freshman year and have gotten involved in several clubs--cheese club, Badger Cru, Sconnie Sports Talk to name a few. One thing I would look to change is the emphasis that is placed on tests--I know it's unlikely to be changed, I just think it's tough for people, especially those who are bad test-takers, to have one test be 50% of their grade. Other than that, these two years have been great--go Badgers!","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2018-04-25T22:29:44.54926Z","guid":"701ee4ec-29d7-454d-8536-f1bf5f2334d5","rating":5},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":4.33}],"photos":{"default":{"crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/20f1bba0ea57723355da0460ab2bb9bcc14af618.jpg","MobileHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/930fd63b8058ceaab63b92570be1f8f8353fd793.jpg","Thumbnail":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/deb1b7c312c971a2585ad9424fb8ccbe1726b4ec"},"licenseName":"UNLICENSED"},"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-89.405356,43.073858,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-89.405356,43.073858,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.8197674418604652,"count":2924},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Madison, WI"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/university-of-wisconsin/#scatterplot"}}]}
