You see most of the same students everyday, so you really get to know you're class mates. One of the best aspects of Penn State Schuylkill  is the free tutoring at anytime. You have the options of student or teacher tutors.

I was even able to join a sorority. I played Volleyball, was committed to the sorority and was in plays and musicals while attending SJC.
