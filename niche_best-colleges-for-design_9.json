Everyone is connected to a very large friend group - from the people in their classes, to former or current roommates to friends of friends - and I love that! I'm a really extraverted person, so being able to make lots of connections and build relationships is something I find a lot of enjoyment in. However, I will say one of WSU's greatest downfalls is the use of Graduate Teaching Assistants (GTA) to teach an entire class. I know they'll have to one day teach a class, but a lot of the GTAs seem a little unprepared for it. Also, off the GTAs I have, some of them have even taught lecture for twenty minutes and let students go. Professors can take up the full hour with one lecture, so GTAs should be held to the same standard. In all honesty, this is just a small problem I have with WSU so far, so I hope it will change as I go forward in my degree program!","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2017-11-03T22:54:13.895863Z","guid":"3d22924d-21f9-46d1-8e96-5bad0f6904f9","rating":4},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":2.66}],"photos":{"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-97.296733,37.716484,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-97.296733,37.716484,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.586053412462908,"count":1348},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Wichita, KS"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/wichita-state-university/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"3a9f619c-c041-4aba-a4c6-f789b057ee3f","content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"University of Akron","type":"College","url":"university-of-akron"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.9592},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":16568},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"910-1180"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Niche User","body":"I had great experiences at the University of Akron!

I'll always recommend WSU to those looking to attend college, it's truly an amazing place to pursue postsecondary education.

But on the real— campus is absolutely beautiful, especially to a girl from flat Texas like me! Fayetteville is utterly charming, and has something for everyone. With thousands of international students and its central location, the diversity is special and so treasured on this campus. I am never worried about making friends of different backgrounds, or finding my niche with those who share my cultural background because it happens so naturally. There are also plenty of religious groups to get plugged into on and around campus. My only complaint is the Hill, but it is worth it to live in Pomfret Hall with bigger bathrooms, a nice common area, and the dining hall which comes in handy on days of inclement weather. I truly love being a Razorback, and am so grateful to call Northwest Arkansas my second home.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2017-12-31T08:20:55.505021Z","guid":"743e04d5-da12-4e79-b8a9-e1fbbec69371","rating":5},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":4}],"photos":{"default":{"author":"mtnorton","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/5469a0f272cd5651b2fcfac357f368e9aedfee1b.jpg","MobileHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/c40b369d23ffb3ef5ca2388827b771cfcb22ef59.jpg","Thumbnail":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/a2ba338f9c416b38ba6a2ee45506047d4f0176e7"},"licenseName":"CC BY ","licenseUrl":"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/2.0/","sourceUrl":"https://www.flickr.com/photos/mtnorton/7212584262/"},"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-94.178214,36.06153,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-94.178214,36.06153,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.787639710716634,"count":3042},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Fayetteville, AR"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/university-of-arkansas/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"6286c2d6-4eac-4036-a834-b347fb976f55","content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":true,"isPremium":false,"name":"East Carolina University","type":"College","url":"east-carolina-university"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.7034},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":12817},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"970-1130"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Freshman","body":"East Carolina is a great four-year North Carolina college that specializes in nursing, business, fine arts, and music programs.

It is very diverse with people from all around the world. The professors are very helpful and there is a common theme of \"the mission to education\" where every person is working with another to improve the educational experience for everyone. \nAlthough having large classes might be an advantage for some people, it minimizes the interaction between the students, which could be improved. Students don't interact very well in classes and rely on extracurricular activities or living on campus to get to know more people. Additionally, another area where the university can improve is the campus food!

I’ve many that talk openly and respectfully concerning lgbt issues, diversity issues, and they always end with their discussions inspiration and motivation to dream big and achieve our goals. \n\nIt’d be a dream if I could continue my education there.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2018-06-04T17:43:01.882008Z","guid":"1ffe6e36-cd4f-4fff-b11b-544c393955d0","rating":5},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":4}],"photos":{"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-111.846044,40.762484,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-111.846044,40.762484,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.7160945413618456,"count":3554},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Salt Lake City, UT"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/university-of-utah/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"f1d14db3-7297-4753-b76f-7ad0b42bec55","content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"Utah State University","type":"College","url":"utah-state-university"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.9025},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":13037},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"980-1220"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Junior","body":"I have thoroughly enjoyed my time at Utah State University.

I attended undergrad at a much smaller university in a rural area but the transition to graduate school here has been relatively simple.  I love the closed campus and for me with night classes, parking is relatively close to the buildings and easily accessed. The professors I've had so far are stellar. Even though the school is bigger, the MAcc program still has smaller classes and the professors really take the time to get to know you and assist you if you need it. The food options on campus are also awesome. Coming from the smaller university where the only options were a cafeteria and one small restaurant, I love having a Chick-fil-A or Subway I can hit up before class.

Also, so many classes are big so its harder to focus and do well in them. The campus is hilly. Academics are great, i’ve only had one bad teacher. Advising sucks I had to figure everything out on my own. Mountainview dorms were awfull, invisible RA, no community events, unfriendly people etc. Now I live in Newing and I love it and it’s so much better! Many Long Island students, intentational students (mostly from Asia) and Jewish students. You have to find your people at this school but once you do your experience can be great. Also, we don’t have certain majors like education (also communications, and others people complain about) which really sucks but they try to sell you on their grad program.

Overall I am really glad I attend the University of Memphis!","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2018-06-08T13:36:59.161349Z","guid":"fa40b6ce-292b-414a-965c-ba0fd77afdf8","rating":5},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":3.33}],"photos":{"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-89.982038,35.115934,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-89.982038,35.115934,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.646560846560847,"count":1890},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Memphis, TN"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/university-of-memphis/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"ee989ed8-524b-4a36-9e10-09c0c8274e3f","content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":true,"isPremium":false,"name":"Boise State University","type":"College","url":"boise-state-university"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.8173},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":11711},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"915-1150"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Freshman","body":"Boise State University - a great place to learn new knowledge and to create new social connections.

Surrounded by mountains, the extracurriculars are endless with skiing, camping, hiking, fishing and biking. Campus is gorgeous through every season, with a mix of old and new buildings, each with their own character. Professors listen and show true passion towards their subjects.  Dorm life was a great experience, and even outside of the dorms there are awesome housing opportunities through town.

There truly is a group for everyone. Students are well taken care of, and the University holds its name in high regard with good reason. Looking for a party? Don't let the Catholic mission fool you. St. John's has as many opportunities to balance social life and academia inside and outside of her walls. Indulge in free fairs, activities, games, amusements, food, and refreshments. Academia in SJU is guided by deans and advisors of your choosing in your given college but remember, like in any college and a lesson to hold throughout your years: fight for what you want!","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2018-06-03T05:48:06.645741Z","guid":"44f4c2a8-2371-4698-b0b7-0943ac8feee4","rating":4},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":3}],"photos":{"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-73.795301,40.721979,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-73.795301,40.721979,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.606974209952779,"count":2753},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Queens, NY"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/st-johns-university---new-york/#scatterplot"}}]}
