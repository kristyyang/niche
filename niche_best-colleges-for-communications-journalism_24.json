I feel excited to come to school and learn now, after feeling burnt out after my first two years. Additionally, there are so many helpful resources to help better your education including an enormous library and success coaches! My success coach has helped me overcome my fear, nervousness, and pushed me to be a better student.

Almost all of my professors have been enthusiastic and passionate about the content they have been teaching, which creates a more engaging classroom.

I could not have survived the first semester at Hiram without the help of my professors for sure.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2017-12-06T23:12:39.35875Z","guid":"a14d0b60-4ea5-4b82-a6c1-21254b444595","rating":4},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":2.66}],"photos":{"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-81.141552,41.310998,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-81.141552,41.310998,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.308270676691729,"count":399},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Hiram, OH"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/hiram-college/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"fb446f79-3b4c-494d-8166-4d9d809e5f7b","content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"University of South Carolina - Upstate","type":"College","url":"university-of-south-carolina---upstate"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.5463},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":14446},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"860-1040"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Niche User","body":"I graduated with my bachelors from this school, I loved my classes and thought my professors were really great.

The professors and staff members strive to help students attain their educational goals. The professors pour so much effort into lectures, which makes going to class worthwhile. I enjoy coming to class each and every day. I love how the classes are small because it gives the students and professors an opportunity to easily interact with one another. It's literally the small college of big dreams because my professors are constantly pushing me to work hard and focus on my career goals.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2018-04-03T20:55:24.609482Z","guid":"8b9c1b30-a77b-49ef-97da-ce0f87dc34ac","rating":5},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":2.66}],"photos":{"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-73.991653,40.693076,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-73.991653,40.693076,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.6512968299711814,"count":347},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Brooklyn Heights, NY"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/st-francis-college/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"96915600-9466-41be-bdab-df44438a2939","content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"Concordia University Chicago","type":"College","url":"concordia-university-chicago"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.4969},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":19980},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"930-1110"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Freshman","body":"Concordia University Chicago is a place where you go to feel at home.
