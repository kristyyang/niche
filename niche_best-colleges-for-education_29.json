After spending two years there, and planning to finish my bachelor's degree there, I have grown to love this college. My favorite part of this college is the love the professors have for the students. All of my professors cared about my character development. Each one of them made sure to let me know that for any reason I could set up a time to talk with them. I also thoroughly enjoyed the resources and information I received there. As a missionary kid, I wondered how much more I could learn about missions. This college has taught me a lot, not only about mission methodology, but even more importantly about my loving God behind it all. My college experience here was a great experience. Of course it is not a perfect place, only Heaven is perfect. No matter what struggles I had during my college years, I always had someone from the college ready to lovingly help me through.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2017-05-27T23:45:08.285639Z","guid":"cebdf270-2144-47bb-8d90-694af06cd65e","rating":5},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":3}],"photos":{"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-93.624208,41.736338,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-93.624208,41.736338,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":4.010989010989011,"count":91},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Ankeny, IA"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/faith-baptist-bible-college--and--theological-seminary/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"9ec0bb4d-ae1a-4d9b-8ed9-22d248186c49","content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"Blue Mountain College","type":"College","url":"blue-mountain-college"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.9686},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":10944},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"900-1200"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Senior","body":"The best thing about BMC is the community.

Town is just minutes away with plenty of things to do and places to go for a night out and away from homework. It provided me the opportunity to play college sports, make lifelong friends and launched me into a career I love just 2.5 months after graduation.

If you decide to join us you won't be disappointed.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2017-08-15T20:12:20.786034Z","guid":"5828bf4f-5642-4dcd-ab3f-0f3f54c9da66","rating":5},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":2.66}],"photos":{"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-87.316127,32.630526,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-87.316127,32.630526,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.352517985611511,"count":139},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Marion, AL"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/judson-college/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"a1d3c46f-b3c7-4448-bbd4-d993f8222169","content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":true,"isPremium":false,"name":"Moore College of Art & Design","type":"College","url":"moore-college-of-art--and--design"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.5714},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":33563},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"850-1100"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Senior","body":"Moore is a great art college if you're looking for diversity and a smaller college community. A lot of the students who go here are quirky, nice, and generally accepting of others, although questionable drama is always bound to happen. Regardless, most of the professors do care about you as long as you're willing to level with them. You will have at least one whose class you hate, and at least 1-3 that you will absolutely love. If you are an illustration or fashion major, I would highly recommend this school. Otherwise, this school still has a great location, great connections, and great facilities.

For undergraduate science students, research opportunities are incredibly accessible which is not common at large universities. I am only a freshman and already know the chair of my department well and plan to join her research team sophomore year. There are also many hospitals and medical facilities in the area where students can get volunteer hours.

The people here at UCSD are unlike any people I have met, they are social in their own way (its a very admirable and fascinating trait). Just because UCSD holds the reputation of no parties does not make the school socially dead, there are other ways people can socialize! There are campus events for everyone in any college and there are events that are specific to each individual college. \nThe people here each have amazing distinct personalities in which anyone can find who they vibe with easily.

The University of Virginia is AMAZING. I have learned a great deal from each of my professors. (I recommend using ratemyprofessor and thecourseform to help you choose them). I actually enjoy going to classes that aren't based on regurgitating information but processing it and actually learning. Additionally, with thousands of clubs, there are plenty of ways to get involved. On another note, there are many stereotypes of people who come to the University, but I promise that not all of us are preppy, rich, and white, though a good portion is. The only problems I have with UVA are the prices of tuition and the honor code. Tuition is expensive and instead of giving grants UVA sometimes gives a lot of loans. Although I love the honor code and what it stands for, it seems to target minorities and foreign students.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2017-08-02T21:55:52.066083Z","guid":"75238c1f-3ce8-4b96-9994-7e4da15e8a23","rating":5},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":4.33}],"photos":{"default":{"author":"vironevaeh","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/488e5eac782b88e31489b688d27c0788a2e5194e.jpg","MobileHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/b344039af213c2a3140fb29177c3b67b8827e6e5.jpg","Thumbnail":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/2e460d21389ae370e4fd05a62e1c1ccbecdf6fd5"},"licenseName":"CC BY-SA","licenseUrl":"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/","sourceUrl":"https://www.flickr.com/photos/vironevaeh/5200391948/"},"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-78.502599,38.036546,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-78.502599,38.036546,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.8272023233301065,"count":2066},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Charlottesville, VA"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/university-of-virginia/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"980c9ebf-929c-464c-95eb-fb6438c82818","content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"University of Texas - El Paso","type":"College","url":"university-of-texas---el-paso"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.9999},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":5713},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"820-1030"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Freshman","body":"The school is located near downtown. There are many restaurants nearby. Also, there are bars and clubs nearby if you are interested in the night life! I am a freshman. So far, my instructors have taught well! A lot of work is required, but I'm sure that goes for any university. There are students of all ages. The parking is TERRIBLE. The school has purchased all parking anywhere near the school and parking permits are needed everywhere. I tried to buy a parking permit but there were no more available. So I was forced to walk a mile to classes, and even still had to pay at parking meters. I didn't mind the walk, but sometimes could not find parking. Another thing I didn't appreciate is that there are no places where I could pump my breast milk, since I am a breastfeeding momma. I always had to pump in restrooms which seemed unsanitary and quite frankly stinky at times. My adviser has been great! She is very helpful. I really do like the school, these were just a few concerns of mine.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2018-06-06T17:53:20.55995Z","guid":"399fb7dd-8c08-4b3d-bb4a-1792d16e7a08","rating":4},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":3}],"photos":{"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-106.50356,31.771697,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-106.50356,31.771697,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.578669910786699,"count":2466},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"El Paso, TX"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/university-of-texas---el-paso/#scatterplot"}}]}
