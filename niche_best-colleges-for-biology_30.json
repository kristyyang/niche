In 2016 I was nominated to participate in Millersville University's Homecoming Court and had the privilege of learning about some of the other student leaders from the university. During my time on Homecoming Court my love for the University grew and I was honored and crowned as Millersville University's 2016 Homecoming Queen.

But our campus contains such diversity that you run into people different than you all the time. Campus activities promote integration of all students, from athletes to bookish types, from African American students to South Korean students.\nThe one thing that many people are weary about is the lifestyle statement, which prohibits many of the 'typical college' activities (smoking, drinking, sex on campus, etc). As an RA, my interactions with the lifestyle statement have given me a broad perspective of the pros and cons of having such an agreement. As a Christian community I think it is imperative that we hold our students to a wholesome standard. However, for those students who do not practice Christianity, I have seen isolation and exclusion on occasion.\nOverall, I love Greenville and am content with my choice for my educational advancement.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2018-02-28T01:52:25.072542Z","guid":"2485c9ef-88ae-471d-846d-63a7487891ef","rating":4},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":3}],"photos":{"default":{"crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/fdd4165fcee1e058a86cf3a51f22704d6bad62b1.jpg","MobileHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/8642a02b748cd3ca2b270e88dceaada520d88779.jpg"},"licenseName":"UNLICENSED"},"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-89.4089,38.8928,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-89.4089,38.8928,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.458974358974359,"count":390},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Greenville, IL"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/greenville-university/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"090fbe90-f532-4e8f-b86b-45495372cce4","content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"University of Northern Colorado","type":"College","url":"university-of-northern-colorado"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.9027},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":13065},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"928-1150"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Freshman","body":"My name is Lauren Espinoza and it is my first year at the University of Northern Colorado and so far it has been blissful!

From exposing you to all activities, clubs, etc. that are provided to filling you with important information necessary to help you transition. I enjoy very much how I feel like I am at home at UNC. Everyone, is very helpful, joyful, energetic and funny. I know that I can count on anybody around campus even though I may not know them. There is a variety of places for one to eat, find resources and places to study and do homework.

I was very impressed during the summer science program I attended in 2017.  My greatest accomplishment was my ability to be the student during the summer science program to receive the overall student achievement. Not only was I surprised, I was absolutely elated. I value the academic challenge Toygaloo offers.  Tougaloo is a private historic kept secret and many people are not aware of the opportunity that this great HBC can offer.  The alumni association is also very encouraging and supportive in more ways than one, but I also have to say the campus can use a more modern updated look.  Tougaloo has been around a long time and mostly all funds come from private donors, with that in mind I understand that the funds are used for people like me to be funded for college books, housing and etc and that can be very costly.  If I could change just one thing I would surely hope this would be the one thing that could possibly be changed.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2018-05-18T22:47:55.917572Z","guid":"150fbea7-1674-44f9-8a1a-ff0e909b1ce0","rating":4},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":2.33}],"photos":{"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-90.159405,32.402719,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-90.159405,32.402719,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.311203319502075,"count":241},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Tougaloo, MS"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/tougaloo-college/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"8f34fbf8-4b19-48f7-afa8-2ce42d051179","content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"University of New Haven","type":"College","url":"university-of-new-haven"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.8053},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":31263},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"930-1140"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Alum","body":"Ujjwal Pruthi\n1.

Whether it was a sporting event or a gathering with snacks to meet up with friends or meet new people, there was always something to do.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2018-04-19T02:55:59.27757Z","guid":"ad133d87-ca65-4f33-947e-9c46abe5c0e9","rating":5},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":3}],"photos":{"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-96.738229,43.531574,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-96.738229,43.531574,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.6633663366336635,"count":202},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Sioux Falls, SD"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/university-of-sioux-falls/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"d4c80d9a-3106-4d1d-96fc-32b1612f5853","content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"San Jose State University","type":"College","url":"san-jose-state-university"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.5344},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":13777},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"920-1150"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Senior","body":"SJSU is an AWESOME college campus and has a AMAZING education system. The university was built in the 1850's and is one of the oldest in the West Coast college systems!\n\nSJSU is VERY WELL CONTAINED I.e. Campus housing; academic, social and athletic activities; campus police/policing; MANY food choices. There is definitely not a need or reason for  FROSH (freshmen) to leave campus. \n\nWe love the university is DIVERSE ethnically, academically and socially.  SJSU is centrally located in the heart of San Jose. It's surrounded by a lot of great culture and beautiful old architecture.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2017-10-02T00:07:17.300014Z","guid":"1826660a-ddd3-40d9-ad4b-d561d111425c","rating":5},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":2.66}],"photos":{"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-121.881214,37.335201,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-121.881214,37.335201,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.5340785169029445,"count":3668},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"San Jose, CA"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/san-jose-state-university/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"7ddc5498-856a-4ed9-91ff-8db68d4672cb","content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"West Liberty University","type":"College","url":"west-liberty-university"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.717},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":12285},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"830-990"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Freshman","body":"West Liberty has a great atmosphere, the campus is nice and peaceful.
