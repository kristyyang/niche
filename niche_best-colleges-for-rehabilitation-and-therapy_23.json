First and foremost the university prides itself on the achievement of academic excellence for its entire student body. The curriculum is varied, interesting and is engineered to maximize the character and well roundedness of its students. This quality of academic achievement is made possible only by an attentive and caring faculty of professors, many of which are expert in their respective fields. Student life at the university is also exceptional. All incoming students are welcomed warmly. The helpfulness of the staff is remarkable considering the fact that each professor is ready and willing to sit one on one with students for discussion. One shortcoming of the university, however, is that, even with its veritable course selection, it offers but one foreign language, that being Spanish. Personally I would have enjoyed a more wide ranging selection of languages.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2017-06-05T19:42:51.155873Z","guid":"52fe6210-a473-4984-9805-bb0f61271409","rating":4},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":3}],"photos":{"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-84.640143,39.094519,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-84.640143,39.094519,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.464968152866242,"count":314},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Cincinnati, OH"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/mount-st-joseph-university/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"1abdb91c-a3c3-4b50-9d2c-0d7464c67b42","content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"Lyndon State College","type":"College","url":"lyndon-state-college"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.9834},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":15587},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"840-1060"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Junior","body":"What I loved about Lyndon State College was that the student to professor ratio was 15-20:1. The professors are willing to work one-on-one and help you succeed. There is many resources available such as tutors, and the academic support center which helps students prioritize, schedule classes, and learn how to effectively study. The academics are optimal and require professionalism and the programs expect high quality, to their best effort out of the students. The community is very open and willing to help anybody. Lyndon gives the opportunity for students to be an athlete while having their main focus on school then sports after. There is many activities to do on campus from student life scheduling opportunities. Activities off campus also includes skiing, hiking, etc. Lyndon provides the optimal opportunity for school and fun, all while receivin the college experience.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2017-12-27T17:32:30.395408Z","guid":"05283d51-b253-4fbb-87ce-3c7896280321","rating":4},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":2.33}],"photos":{"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-72.024563,44.53433,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-72.024563,44.53433,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.34,"count":250},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Lyndonville, VT"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/lyndon-state-college/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"871038fd-adfe-462a-9873-d9533e8c290b","content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"Bacone College","type":"College","url":"bacone-college"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.5047},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":25029},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"740-920"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Freshman","body":"It’s a small college that’s growing steadily with an extremely athletic atmosphere!

But if you want to speak to almost everyone you pass on your way to class, have professors who take time to get to know you and will ask if y'all can catch up after you graduate, have the opportunity to take on leadership roles in your extra curricular activities, and become a part of a FAMILY, Averett should be your number one choice.\n\nThe professors and advisors are phenomenal. If you're wondering just how close of a relationship you make with the staff at Averett - my advisor has a picture of us hanging in her office from my senior pinning, and when going through a hard time in a leadership role, the president wrote me an encouraging handwritten letter. The relationships you make with the staff are exceptional.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2018-02-24T06:03:41.889373Z","guid":"12269862-28ce-48f8-88ec-2ccbae4a7cd1","rating":5},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":2.33}],"photos":{"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-79.413214,36.577273,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-79.413214,36.577273,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.473015873015873,"count":315},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Danville, VA"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/averett-university/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"2acb74fa-6772-4d5e-b8e0-e3db5fb033e1","content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"Bluefield College","type":"College","url":"bluefield-college"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.8481},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":21269},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"790-1010"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Sophomore","body":"I absolutely love Bluefield College.

Athletes are friends with the students in Greek life, who are friends with the students who participate in performing arts.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2017-12-22T21:30:15.797417Z","guid":"08c5b662-9b06-47d4-a30c-80ef775f4207","rating":5},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":2.66}],"photos":{"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-87.121984,37.744667,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-87.121984,37.744667,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.548611111111111,"count":144},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Owensboro, KY"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/kentucky-wesleyan-college/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"03cebe66-cb3c-4d99-a10f-1202a019b8b8","content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"Central Baptist College","type":"College","url":"central-baptist-college"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.6195},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":13897},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"815-965"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Sophomore","body":"I’ve loved my time at CBC. While the course load can get challenging and stressful at times it’s very easy to keep up with if you stay organized. Your professors actually care about you beyond what they see in the classroom. They are always willing to help you and make time to listen. I have met more than friends I have met a family at CBC and I couldn’t be more thankful for the opportunity to grow in my faith with fellowship of other believers!","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2018-05-25T04:18:00.903788Z","guid":"bf954b6f-7da4-4a47-a52e-e15da2fa1f0f","rating":4},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":3}],"photos":{"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-92.444102,35.084574,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-92.444102,35.084574,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.710691823899371,"count":159},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Conway, AR"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/central-baptist-college/#scatterplot"}}]}
