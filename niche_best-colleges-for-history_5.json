The small class sizes definitely help the close atmosphere one can develop with professors. The number of extracurriculars you can apply yourself to are also amazing. There's a club for everything. And I will plug a little about the theater group the College Players as I am a part of that! We have the second oldest student-run college theater group in the USA, second only to Harvard.

The professors are brilliant people who challenge students to think creatively and encourage the inclusion of other perspectives to create the best experience for the community as a whole. The classes are perhaps the most unique I have ever taken, and the curriculum helps students develop skills necessary for any major they wish to pursue.

There is a real sense of community; the history and quirkiness of the school only add to the charm. While the faculty and staff are incredibly caring and attentive. There are also a ton of opportunities on and off campus. Roanoke is a great location in the heart of the Blue Ridge Mountains which provides endless hiking trails and outdoor areas to explore, and downtown is just a quick drive from campus as well, there really is something for everyone.  The number of clubs, organizations, and activities on campus is incredible considering the schools size.  Academically the student to teacher ratio is awesome, I love knowing all my Professors personally and having them know me. Professors really seem to care about your thoughts and want you to be involved in class. They will really go out of their way in order to insure you have the best experience possible.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2018-05-01T06:27:53.098271Z","guid":"53eee7b9-d029-4f97-9c67-6e90ac59f634","rating":4},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":3.33}],"photos":{"mapbox_header":{"crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-79.942196,37.354629,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-79.942196,37.354629,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"UNLICENSED"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.5,"count":454},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Roanoke, VA"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/hollins-university/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"73446a4f-a085-462a-8efb-3bab23d03fce","badge":{"display":"Best Colleges for History in America","ordinal":118,"total":640,"vanityURL":"best-colleges-for-history"},"content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"Spelman College","type":"College","url":"spelman-college"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.3573},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":32399},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"980-1170"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Freshman","body":"Spelman is an amazing institution––coming here is the best decision I have made!

UCSC is also very close to the ocean, making it a great location for those who love to frequent the beach.  Aside from location, I have had great experiences academically with this school.  All of my professors have been extremely kind and genuinely interested in the wellbeing and learning process of their students.

The people here at UCSD are unlike any people I have met, they are social in their own way (its a very admirable and fascinating trait). Just because UCSD holds the reputation of no parties does not make the school socially dead, there are other ways people can socialize! There are campus events for everyone in any college and there are events that are specific to each individual college. \nThe people here each have amazing distinct personalities in which anyone can find who they vibe with easily.

With a campus in the \"capital of the world\", the location provides opportunities unrivaled by others.  By planning ahead, you can schedule classes with some top-notch professors who actively help students succeed and provide an unforgettable learning experience.  Though Core requirements are extensive, even excessive to some, they make way for an education that explores all fields.  The Jesuit presence is in no way overbearing and the community is open to a diversity of thought (Professors are almost always unrelated to the Church; even theology classes teach a variety of religions).  The Rose Hill campus is quite beautiful, boasting sports teams, a large library, and a variety of eateries.  Both campuses are very safe and any incidents are vigilantly pursued by campus safety and the NYPD. Fordham can be a very good experience, if deemed worth the price point (note they do award aid) and if one is willing to take advantage of their time there.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2018-06-05T17:39:23.039915Z","guid":"c7e106e7-e1c4-45d2-8987-d3382185aaa0","rating":4},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":3.66}],"photos":{"default":{"crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/58a16aa62394c04c88abf70482b6dfc699f8d219.jpg","MobileHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/2a5478c448466060f510b754b7a99112cf2dbc0c.jpg"},"licenseName":"UNLICENSED"},"mapbox_header":{"crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-73.889578,40.861183,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-73.889578,40.861183,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"UNLICENSED"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.4920049200492005,"count":1626},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Bronx, NY"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/fordham-university/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"57d8bd56-93aa-496b-98cb-0b2f431cbad4","badge":{"display":"Best Colleges for History in America","ordinal":125,"total":640,"vanityURL":"best-colleges-for-history"},"content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":true,"isPremium":false,"name":"Hampden-Sydney College","type":"College","url":"hampden-sydney-college"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.556},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":33210},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"1010-1230"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Freshman","body":"This is as you know it is a all male college.
