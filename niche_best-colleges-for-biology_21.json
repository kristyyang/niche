The events and programs on campus are almost all student lead  and developed, so all of the events benefit students of all backgrounds and interests.  There is always something to do on the weekends, and if nothing interests you specifically, their is always an opportunity for you to organize an event to reach out to students with the same interest; all with the support of whatever club/organization you choose to go through.

This school is also very affordable for both in-state and out-of-state students, thanks to the Bearcat Advantage scholarship which covers the difference of in-state tuition for out-of-state students. Another great thing about this university is that laptops and textbooks are included in tuition. Aside from the academic and campus culture, the community culture is also amazing.

The small campus and close-knit community made for the best college experience. The relationships you make will last forever because when you’re around people who want to be successful empowers you to want to be successful too. I am still very close with those I met from UJ and know it’s a relationship for life. UJ was a big chapter in the career I have now and that I will forever be grateful for. Your professors strongly encourage you to better yourself in all aspects of your life: mentally, physically, and spiritually. You’re cared for and supported by everyone which allows you to take risks and grow. That’s part of the Jamestown and Midwest culture which I absolutely love and miss. Luckily, I was adopted by 3 families because I couldn’t go home for the holidays. They took me in whenever I needed a home. UJ will forever hold a special place in my heart!

For a school whose motto is \" OC is home\", it really does feel like home. It is a loving environment where you are constantly surrounded by like-minded Christians who, for the most part, share similar beliefs. College is a time where you meet life long friends, and I believe that I have done that. The professors are also amazing. They care so deeply about their students, and desire to know them on a personal level, and that is such a wonderful thing.

It is such a relaxing environment and you never get bored of looking at that view. Quinnipiac was a very convenient choice for me because I was planning on being a commuter and the campus is close to home. In my second year here, I can say with certainty that everyone here is so friendly and always willing to help you. The professors are amazing and they will do everything they can to make sure you are understanding the concepts and succeeding academically. Another interesting thing about Quinnipiac is that it has many clubs and organizations available. In this way, each student can definitely find something that matches their hobbies and interests. And lastly, I am glad I chose Quinnipiac because it offers such an interesting major, which is Behavioral Neuroscience.

Lebanon Valley College is a predominately white campus, although there is a strong support system for diverse students. Not all dorms have an air conditioning unit. Public Safety constantly picks up any fallen tree branches, shovels snow, and checks buildings to keep the campus safe. Annville is a small quiet town and the elderly are not afraid to call the police if the parties get too rowdy.  The campus food is not the best, but there is always a salad bar and deli. Turkey Hill also supplies the ice cream. Overall, Student Life is wonderful because of the small campus atmosphere, residential life, and strong support systems.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2017-11-26T05:10:44.135345Z","guid":"f35b0c23-89fa-4f0f-b3f4-cd46eaa73996","rating":4},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":3}],"photos":{"default":{"crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/b1f4e61e020e6c6fcb285452b90a38c2ece628af.jpg","MobileHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/f493c8c7ff60bde0b46f8125d88154472161e700.jpg"},"licenseName":"UNLICENSED"},"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-76.513753,40.331733,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-76.513753,40.331733,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.535372848948375,"count":523},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Annville, PA"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/lebanon-valley-college/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"0d7e89d6-ca95-4ad4-bf25-7b1b7760474c","content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"Evergreen State College","type":"College","url":"evergreen-state-college"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.9748},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":13367},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"920-1180"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Sophomore","body":"Evergreen allows individuals to have the freedom to design their own education and build independence.

URI provides you with excellent resources to make the absolute most out of your college experience. There are hundreds of clubs and ways to get involved on campus. I lived in a Living and Learning Community, which meant I lived in a dorm with people from my major. It really helped me succeed in my classes and introduced me to so many friends!","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2018-05-17T17:11:47.505877Z","guid":"764d97a0-7b0d-40ac-8e5d-87e63c5ee5fa","rating":5},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":3}],"photos":{"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-71.527356,41.484691,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-71.527356,41.484691,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.4363057324840764,"count":2198},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Kingston, RI"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/university-of-rhode-island/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"5429db04-f778-44a5-899c-1bc7848631d7","content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"Misericordia University","type":"College","url":"misericordia-university"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.7444},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":24715},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"950-1140"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Freshman","body":"Students and faculty are extremely nice, and caring.

The administration has been intact for some 40 years, therefore it is very difficult to get things such as food quality, dorm maintenance, and events to change for the better. Although this year was a very academically rigorous year, it did lack in other areas. In the aforementioned areas, students had to organize a sit in protest in order to have our voices and concerns addressed. Academically speaking, Hampton University is not lacking at all, well, at least in my experience. All of my professors were professional, thorough, and cared about the well being and academic journey of their students. Entering my sophomore year, I look forward to how this illustrious institution will grow, or decline!","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2018-05-18T18:54:22.157176Z","guid":"ae3e8cc6-c609-4a16-ae37-ca3c5f628c1a","rating":4},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":2.66}],"photos":{"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-76.337647,37.022084,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-76.337647,37.022084,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.189840944073884,"count":1949},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Hampton, VA"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/hampton-university/#scatterplot"}}]}
