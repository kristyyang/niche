Staff are always willing to help students and make them feel like they're at home. Professors are approachable and are always willing to hear what you have to say. There's tremendously unique experiences that NMSU provides for students. Aside from experiences there's also different kind of activities and organizations where I can find a perfect match to what I like to do and people just get to collaborate with one another. There's over 180+ degrees in NMSU to pick from and just the fact that they had the perfect match to the degree that I wanted to pursue. A couple of things that I think the campus needs to work on is the dorms on campus, there's always something negative that's happening whether is the water, undistinguished smells, door locks. However overall it's a great campus!","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2017-10-26T17:58:44.715482Z","guid":"a178a871-ee50-4105-9045-255724dca34a","rating":4},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":3}],"photos":{"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-106.747841,32.282875,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-106.747841,32.282875,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.527181688125894,"count":2796},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Las Cruces, NM"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/new-mexico-state-university/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"0498177d-d318-4ce8-89de-0b72c1c4477e","content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":true,"isPremium":false,"name":"Bethel College - Indiana","type":"College","url":"bethel-college---indiana"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.9777},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":19525},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"910-1150"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Freshman","body":"I liked how small Bethel College is, everything is all right there nice and close together!

The professors are always available for outside of class help, and most of the professors try their best to make a relationship with each student.  The campus is beautiful and constantly undergoing new development and improvement.  Connecting with campus is seamless as each club and program is more than willing to accept new team members to help organize events and bring out the colonel spirit.   The events and programs on campus are almost all student lead  and developed, so all of the events benefit students of all backgrounds and interests.  There is always something to do on the weekends, and if nothing interests you specifically, their is always an opportunity for you to organize an event to reach out to students with the same interest; all with the support of whatever club/organization you choose to go through.  The campus is all about expanding its influence into the community and helping those in need.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2018-01-10T18:31:44.551923Z","guid":"5d5c0d01-e395-40c1-a999-4959f1d4455c","rating":5},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":3}],"photos":{"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-75.88833,41.243204,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-75.88833,41.243204,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.396414342629482,"count":502},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Wilkes-Barre, PA"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/wilkes-university/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"888d286e-417b-464d-afb5-16c82444584a","content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":true,"isPremium":true,"name":"University of Mobile","type":"College","url":"university-of-mobile"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.6193},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":21567},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"850-1120"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Sophomore","body":"The University of Mobile is a fantastic school with a great staff!

Additionally, GW has huge diversity within the campus. We have many students who live across the world just to come here, a lot of them for sports. Another benefit about going to GW is the security/safety. We have an actual police department on campus that consists of about eight to nine officers on call.

The city itself is a neat, they recently received a 10 million dollar grant to renovate downtown. Huge economy boost. Syracuse's Destiny mall is a half hour away and SUNY Cortland sponsors trips to go there so if you or your friends dont have a car, you’re good.

The campus is really pretty and has been updated in a lot of ways--there is a caribou coffee and snack shop in the library (the library is beautiful, spacious, and bright btw!), they have added another newer coffee shop in Somsen Hall as well.  Yes like all colleges there are a lot of old buildings, but they have charm and history.  The Wellness Center is amazing--relatively updated and very modern looking.    The food court has also been remodeled and looks great as well.  Overall, I had a great time at the school--true, the city of Winona is a little bland, there is the typical movie theater and a couple restaurants that aren't chains, but its a small town.  Typically, people can travel to La Crosse or Rochester for the nearest mall or other adventures.  Honestly though, Winona State is beautiful and a pretty great school.

I really like this school, but as a local, I can tell you that Fredonia itself is a pretty boring town, however I've noticed that many students from NYC appreciate that.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2018-01-20T08:04:05.042899Z","guid":"dd3407fb-96bb-4744-9704-16e57139c800","rating":4},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":3}],"photos":{"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-79.336109,42.450961,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-79.336109,42.450961,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.5501379944802207,"count":1087},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Fredonia, NY"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/suny-fredonia/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"409f3fdc-df3d-4482-9f3c-fdb10492bab1","content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":true,"isPremium":false,"name":"Springfield College - Massachusetts","type":"College","url":"springfield-college---massachusetts"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.659},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":28368},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"900-1120"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Senior","body":"Springfield College is a tight knit community with it's students and faculty, built on the Humanics Philosophy.
