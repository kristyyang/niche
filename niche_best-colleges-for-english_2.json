For a small school, after a semester I am still meeting people I've never seen before (maybe I'm just unobservant),  and it seems students still find themselves making new friends even senior year. It's very high school socially, perhaps because of size, but the cliques aren't as intimidating. \nI have enjoyed classes immensely, not that I've had so much experience with them yet.

From amazing professors who take their time to make sure each and every student understands the material, to the amazing programs we offer such as the 3-2 program, plethora of summer research, Priddy Trips, Venture Grants, and yes even great food!\n\nWhat I wish would change is the constant racism we see from the students, to the faculty and staff, and even the professors. Unfortunately it is rampant and very hard to deal with as a Native American on campus. Constant micro-aggressions wherever you go make life in general tough to deal with.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2017-09-28T01:22:27.354795Z","guid":"a34cefb4-ec9f-4db0-b3c9-1255b763cb36","rating":4},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":4.33}],"photos":{"default":{"author":"denverjeffrey","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/db6d095fbee180989406ab45959bb1a5b041b99f.jpg","MobileHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/adbe9c372aafd1e7372de68d1b0209bbe42dbc99.jpg","Thumbnail":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/9ee676e0238090642134ebc7dbdb958145416427"},"licenseName":"CC BY-SA","licenseUrl":"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/","sourceUrl":"https://www.flickr.com/photos/denverjeffrey/6421757137/"},"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-104.82422,38.84657,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-104.82422,38.84657,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.625,"count":720},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Colorado Springs, CO"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/colorado-college/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"0055c0af-444e-46b0-a9a0-857a5e30966b","badge":{"display":"Best Colleges for English in America","ordinal":38,"total":647,"vanityURL":"best-colleges-for-english"},"content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":true,"isPremium":false,"name":"Colgate University","type":"College","url":"colgate-university"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.2878},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":22463},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"1290-1460"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Senior","body":"Colgate has changed my life.

The professors are really understanding for the most part and they all are very knowledgeable in their department. Also the Bi-Co is a pretty neat program at the school. We could also take classes at Swarthmore and UPenn even though that's more uncommon but if you really want to do it you can. The students can get a little rattled when it comes to politics and it's really liberal, some people like that others don't, just depends on who you talk to. The campus is sooo beautiful all throughout the year! And housing is one the best parts because most of the rooms are really big and you can get a single your sophomore year. The college also does a good job at matching roommates for first years. It can get a little boring because it's in a suburb but Philly close enough that you could go into the city every weekend if you wanted to.

Colby students are friendly, extremely intelligent, and well-rounded. Most of my friends volunteered, had an on-campus job or worked in a lab, and actively participated in campus clubs. The Colby bubble can become a little suffocating, as it is easy to not leave campus for weeks, but I am honestly sad I will never be in such a tight-knit community of similar-minded peers again.

There are a ton of resources for freshman; a social advisor, academic advisor, Junior Advisor and much more. Athletics at Bates are very good, but it can feel like a very jock-y place but there is also a good amount of mixing between athletes and non-athletes. The gyms can feel a little old. \n\nThe surrounding area is a little rough and it can be hard to find things to do unless you really seek them out. There are a few really good places like Forage Market and Fuel and some other hidden gems around. There are quite a few good hikes around the area, usually an hour away or so. It's really nice to have a car on campus although parking is tight.\n\nBates is a really great place that does have its downsides as well, like all colleges.

Additionally, with thousands of clubs, there are plenty of ways to get involved. On another note, there are many stereotypes of people who come to the University, but I promise that not all of us are preppy, rich, and white, though a good portion is. The only problems I have with UVA are the prices of tuition and the honor code. Tuition is expensive and instead of giving grants UVA sometimes gives a lot of loans.
