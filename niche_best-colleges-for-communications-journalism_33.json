The Professors are great, they push their students to strive academically. One thing I would say is negative about the school, is the parking. Parking on campus is horrible! You have to pay $150 per semester to park on campus, and when you do find a spot, you have to walk a half mile to class. I just got a hundred dollar ticket a week ago for parking in the wrong spot. I wish they would try to improve the parking situation.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2017-11-13T17:41:05.018366Z","guid":"156c3021-d415-4036-ab77-f84eb42216d5","rating":4},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":3}],"photos":{"default":{"crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/f76f37b2c77cbc3d8316f04445c1b74e634818d0.jpg","MobileHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/2fee799f116d7a4b2367eacb9adc16cecd92c6c3.jpg"},"licenseName":"UNLICENSED"},"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-92.105738,46.81544,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-92.105738,46.81544,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.6693548387096775,"count":496},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Duluth, MN"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/the-college-of-st-scholastica/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"1128c680-a792-4e35-a832-b7b15db33cd9","content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"Upper Iowa University","type":"College","url":"upper-iowa-university"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.5555},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":23405},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"860-880"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Sophomore","body":"Everyone from financial aide to the advisers have been amazing and super helpful!

There are numerous support programs for students that are all free, including counseling and tutoring. Since it's a commuter campus there are an extraordinarily large amount of sitting spots throughout campus for students to study and relax.

There is a wide range of subjects that are offered, so odds are that you will find the types of classes you are looking for. During the time between classes, you can sit in one of the many comfortable couches and chairs in various parts of the school. The food is good too, if you're wondering about that. Just beware of the Freshman 15 if you eat from the buffet!","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2017-02-22T22:30:04.713927Z","guid":"63dc225c-dd46-461a-9e7b-e561948c70d2","rating":4},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":2.33}],"photos":{"default":{"crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/117cc499cfc90e54fdfd1a5f35b8a1c8b06b0181.jpg","MobileHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/c82084655fd117d337c185e9a36426957da2561b.jpg"},"licenseName":"UNLICENSED"},"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-95.75983,44.455023,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-95.75983,44.455023,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.4014084507042255,"count":284},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Marshall, MN"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/southwest-minnesota-state-university/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"f8382ae9-ef0d-4460-a95f-19ed6d64da23","content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"Wingate University","type":"College","url":"wingate-university"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.6956},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":17307},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"940-1130"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Freshman","body":"There's so many volunteer opportunities on campus that will help keep someone involved in the community. It gives you an opportunity to network and meet the different kinds of people you find on this campus. The library's service is always on point! They've always been so helpful and it's never been too crowded for me to get a spot at the computer lab or have a place to study. My professors were amazing in every way and I never once left the classroom with unanswered questions. Communication is reliable with professors as long as you attend classes as regularly as possible. At Wingate, you'll get a nice exercise because walking is mostly how students get around.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2017-12-29T04:17:21.879159Z","guid":"373eda2f-6d47-4d38-85fd-747eab8dc3aa","rating":5},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":3}],"photos":{"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-80.444465,34.979384,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-80.444465,34.979384,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.5716612377850163,"count":614},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Wingate, NC"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/wingate-university/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"24927aec-aa48-4601-b7f4-51c47333e150","content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"Minot State University","type":"College","url":"minot-state-university"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.5981},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":9987},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"920-1090"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Junior","body":"Minot State University is an awesome university with a small, close knit classrooms and a fun, interactive college activities.
