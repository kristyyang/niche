The people are so friendly and collaborative, and the residential college system gives you an automatic support system and built-in friends/family. While people are smart, the atmosphere is close-knit and not cutthroat, which I've come to realize is hugely important when I hear my friends at other top universities talk about the pressure and competition they suffer through. The academics aren't easy- especially the STEM programs, which are structured to be some of the most rigorous in the country, but that's why we have such a good reputation and ease with post-graduation placements. Compared to other colleges, there's a lot of freedom with social life/partying and distribution requirements. Overall, the campus is beautiful and quality of life (dorms/food/area) very high. I love Rice and wouldn't go anywhere else!","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2017-03-19T21:34:13.893756Z","guid":"3f40edd2-5828-4c40-a309-0f4360a7cf61","rating":5},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":4.33}],"photos":{"default":{"author":"tendenci","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/5b7ca0b9ebc20cb988dd774b5ff841b6d99ecc64.jpg","MobileHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/8d92756b9d7a026f089df9941f38ffcf7744ae10.jpg","Thumbnail":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/a98fb04b0afa8ca70d8f804fd7fd33bae27edb16"},"licenseName":"CC BY ","licenseUrl":"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/2.0/","sourceUrl":"https://www.flickr.com/photos/tendenci/13590068763/"},"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-95.403625,29.716485,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-95.403625,29.716485,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":4.000995024875622,"count":1005},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Houston, TX"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/rice-university/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"2c83ac29-32ae-479e-ba62-a60b2380c691","badge":{"display":"Best Colleges for Architecture in America","ordinal":2,"total":116,"vanityURL":"best-colleges-for-architecture"},"content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"Washington University in St. Louis","type":"College","url":"washington-university-in-st-louis"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.1653},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":28824},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"1400-1570"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Senior","body":"WashU has opened up a lot of doors for me in terms of career exploration and pursuit.

It’s not necessary to be Catholic and people who aren’t religious at all won’t feel excluded, but it is especially amazing for people who are religious. I myself am not very religious but was raised in the faith and do appreciate it, so I enjoyed being around it and taking the required Theology and Philosophy courses. Everyone is extremely nice and collaborative! Very smart people here and caring professors. Single sex dorms is a negative as well as less opportunities for medical professions, as there is no hospital or medical focus here. I would say it’s best for business, engineering, or liberal arts.

For instance, I am a double major in Government and International Relations and Global Studies and am continuously amazed at the amount of programs, events, lectures , courses, and books available just for students in those majors. Your college's department of Career Services will blow you away as well, they will provide any and all resources to ensure your success after graduation.

The University of Virginia is AMAZING. I have learned a great deal from each of my professors. (I recommend using ratemyprofessor and thecourseform to help you choose them).

Additionally, with thousands of clubs, there are plenty of ways to get involved. On another note, there are many stereotypes of people who come to the University, but I promise that not all of us are preppy, rich, and white, though a good portion is. The only problems I have with UVA are the prices of tuition and the honor code. Tuition is expensive and instead of giving grants UVA sometimes gives a lot of loans.

The professors are hard working and qualified, the people are friendly, there are a lot of kids from all over the world, and the campus is awesome!

I would recommend this university to students who are social, hard-working and competitive.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2018-03-22T21:35:03.369409Z","guid":"79d52442-1c21-49a5-9876-27dccd81c450","rating":5},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":4.33}],"photos":{"default":{"crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/fe66f26254caf6de36fea90af9c4849312e4cb64.jpg","MobileHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/2a1f855cc82936d84ac86d8ca7db2777be300743.jpg","Thumbnail":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/63bbec5d35965d2eb9fdaca02a8d43cd5b1ef488"},"licenseName":"UNLICENSED"},"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-71.088782,42.339992,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-71.088782,42.339992,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.662531017369727,"count":3224},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Boston, MA"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/northeastern-university/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"eeb0e829-996a-45b1-9671-3ef4af096423","badge":{"display":"Best Colleges for Architecture in America","ordinal":13,"total":116,"vanityURL":"best-colleges-for-architecture"},"content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"Virginia Tech","type":"College","url":"virginia-tech"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.7087},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":17190},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"1100-1320"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Niche User","body":"Virginia Tech is an ideal institution for new opportunities and growth. There is such a huge amount of school spirit and pride for being a Hokie with the students, which I have never genuinely heard or seen from other institutions! Campus/student life is notably wonderful, and the majority of the students are incredibly lively and welcoming. There are so many different people on campus, and they all have their own amazing passions. The institution provides exposure to many experiences to explore like clubs, GobblerFest, athletics and football games, dorm activities, parties, hiking trails, and even checking out scenic spots on campus and throughout the town.

The athletics teams at this school are great too, with our football team's ever-increasing ranking. We have had several celebrities come to the University of Miami, parading around campus, throwing up the \"U\" at sports games, and notably even filming a music video here!

The professors are knowledgable and with a smaller campus and small class sizes, you can really get the attention and help you need from your professors. However, Cal Poly struggles with diversity. There are some programs directed to making prospective students of color feel more welcome (such as Poly Cultural Weekend) but overall, people of color make up less than half of the student body. There is even less people of color apart of Cal Poly's faculty. The lack of diversity is also apparent in the town, not just on campus.  If you are coming from a big city to San Luis Obispo, Cal Poly will be a big change. Since it is such a smaller, quieter area, there is not much to do here, especially if you're under 21. That being said, there are a lot of places to hike and hammock if you're a nature lover! The Farmers Market on Thursdays are a popular spot and attract many residents. The beaches are beautiful.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2018-03-17T01:44:31.222074Z","guid":"9ff1f622-a6e1-446a-a07d-cb47c5a415e5","rating":4},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":4}],"photos":{"default":{"crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/d616af4cad52b01bbd8dd743a1d9e0ce6ae6f812.jpg","MobileHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/aca929811f06f81522da2dd062f12da6e2a1c0c7.jpg","Thumbnail":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/1f9a259894aa3b00a7947ed85418992f32b03688"},"licenseName":"UNLICENSED"},"mapbox_header":{"crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-120.65856,35.29889,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-120.65856,35.29889,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"UNLICENSED"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.6969783352337515,"count":3508},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"San Luis Obispo, CA"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/california-polytechnic-state-university---san-luis-obispo/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"031491d5-5fa9-44fd-8996-98b1888c7f03","badge":{"display":"Best Colleges for Architecture in America","ordinal":22,"total":116,"vanityURL":"best-colleges-for-architecture"},"content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"Rhode Island School of Design","type":"College","url":"rhode-island-school-of-design"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.3412},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":39389},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"1080-1340"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Freshman","body":"As a Freshman at RISD, my perspective of RISD as a whole is limited. However, from what I've experienced, it's been overwhelmingly positive. The professors here are all skilled in a different areas, which makes Foundation year a very broad and interdisciplinary year. Indeed, students who want to focus on only one area of study find it tedious, but I found it very eye-opening. After all, I got the chance to work with mediums from paint to wood, which I've never touched. One truly exemplary part of RISD is the dining: they're very open to all types of eaters, and are open to change. If the food doesn't cover a wide enough spectrum, then there are methods of contacting the MET in order to change that. The MET staff are very kind and friendly, always open to conversation.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2018-03-29T09:04:16.437004Z","guid":"b4194fa2-89c2-4a15-ba50-180c1fb093e9","rating":4},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":4}],"photos":{"default":{"author":"woneffe","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/f7f8cd4dd5a6cb929c475a4063377a4266243e93.jpg","MobileHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/73b237c1328616a2c9b3ffcd5b0f0a128961bce3.jpg","Thumbnail":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/efa21c864eada53983b699012757771cd3bad7a8"},"licenseName":"CC BY-SA","licenseUrl":"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/","sourceUrl":"https://www.flickr.com/photos/woneffe/4048957944/"},"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-71.407692,41.825935,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-71.407692,41.825935,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.7114754098360656,"count":305},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Providence, RI"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/rhode-island-school-of-design/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"5f7744b8-95c8-430a-98e4-44dda2ee91e9","badge":{"display":"Best Colleges for Architecture in America","ordinal":23,"total":116,"vanityURL":"best-colleges-for-architecture"},"content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":true,"isPremium":false,"name":"Illinois Institute of Technology","type":"College","url":"illinois-institute-of-technology"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.571},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":25847},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"1130-1360"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Alum","body":"Illinois Institute of Technology offers a great selection of resources for students and the teachers all have an evident great passion for teaching!
