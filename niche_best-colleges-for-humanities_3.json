The support system of students and faculty is outstanding; I have never felt stranded at any point while I've been here. It also doesn't hurt that pretty much all of our athletic teams are successful (especially basketball)! My only complaint is that I didn't receive as much financial aid as I would have liked, but since I am an in-state student, the price is still manageable.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2018-01-09T21:59:10.146821Z","guid":"6f61dc48-f342-4c17-9fcc-bc7da8644662","rating":5},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":4.33}],"photos":{"default":{"author":"yeungb","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/af8e5289916e3e4d650a316ccb2c3980c2f4e37c.jpg","MobileHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/e08339d8a5308e72b7c4beddb2df0c0cdad8d0d5.jpg","Thumbnail":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/3e8d27dcd48f95494e99b933ba8c516f2fbe1fbb"},"licenseName":"CC BY ","licenseUrl":"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/2.0/","sourceUrl":"https://www.flickr.com/photos/yeungb/9439875304/"},"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-79.050969,35.912165,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-79.050969,35.912165,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.7965641952983726,"count":2212},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Chapel Hill, NC"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/university-of-north-carolina-at-chapel-hill/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"9ec8d52e-4aec-4d22-8932-cd330813dcd5","badge":{"display":"Best Colleges in America","ordinal":30,"total":1644,"vanityURL":"best-colleges"},"content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":true,"isPremium":false,"name":"Washington & Lee University","type":"College","url":"washington--and--lee-university"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.2358},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":23867},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"1320-1460"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Alum","body":"Washington and Lee offers a wonderful liberal arts education at a premier southern institution.  Although the campus environment is not for everyone, I enjoyed my time there.\n\nProspective students should know that Greek Life, while not mandatory in any sense, is deep-rooted in our campus culture. That being said, there are plenty of groups and organizations for everyone to feel involved and welcomed somewhere. \n\nProfessors genuinely care about students as individuals and many will make efforts to get to know you. Office hours are abundant and the professors are always willing to go over difficult material with students. Class sizes vary from 5 -20 students with few exceptions.\n\nThere are 5 dining areas on campus: one main dining hall and four smaller \"cafes\".

The professors are hard working and qualified, the people are friendly, there are a lot of kids from all over the world, and the campus is awesome! Most students come to Northeastern because of the co-op program which is the most significant part of the university.

Constant micro-aggressions wherever you go make life in general tough to deal with.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2017-09-28T01:22:27.354795Z","guid":"a34cefb4-ec9f-4db0-b3c9-1255b763cb36","rating":4},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":4.33}],"photos":{"default":{"author":"denverjeffrey","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/db6d095fbee180989406ab45959bb1a5b041b99f.jpg","MobileHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/adbe9c372aafd1e7372de68d1b0209bbe42dbc99.jpg","Thumbnail":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/9ee676e0238090642134ebc7dbdb958145416427"},"licenseName":"CC BY-SA","licenseUrl":"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/","sourceUrl":"https://www.flickr.com/photos/denverjeffrey/6421757137/"},"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-104.82422,38.84657,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-104.82422,38.84657,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.625,"count":720},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Colorado Springs, CO"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/colorado-college/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"6d71d96c-77f0-4fc6-846f-8f4835ca6420","badge":{"display":"Best Colleges in America","ordinal":103,"total":1644,"vanityURL":"best-colleges"},"content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"Kenyon College","type":"College","url":"kenyon-college"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.2658},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":28192},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"1230-1440"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Freshman","body":"It is a lot more sports/Greek oriented than I imagined, but I still enjoy it. For a small school, after a semester I am still meeting people I've never seen before (maybe I'm just unobservant),  and it seems students still find themselves making new friends even senior year. It's very high school socially, perhaps because of size, but the cliques aren't as intimidating. \nI have enjoyed classes immensely, not that I've had so much experience with them yet. I would recommend contacting professors early and often– twice I have contacted professors with interest in a particular course and they have just enrolled me! This doesn't seem like a super frequent practice, but do all you can  to get on waitlists as soon as possible because enrolling in courses is surprisingly difficult. Introducing yourself in person to prospective professors goes a long way.

The students can get a little rattled when it comes to politics and it's really liberal, some people like that others don't, just depends on who you talk to. The campus is sooo beautiful all throughout the year! And housing is one the best parts because most of the rooms are really big and you can get a single your sophomore year.

Dhall is life and I would be so lost without Spa and Burgess.  Dorms and on-campus apartments are spacious and have everything you could possibly need!  I definitely made the right choice coming here.  There is no Greek life, which is awesome in my opinion.  Also, Saratoga Springs is quite possibly the most beautiful little city I have ever seen.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2017-04-29T07:19:37.052188Z","guid":"f94500b1-e292-4030-9a3b-c6f1d4c25d0a","rating":5},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":4}],"photos":{"default":{"crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/ad72f5277e4ca7e90712c9b8145a1145168a0ce2.jpg","MobileHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/2026051e4b310b6e180caee134f54593e2b98e3a.jpg"},"licenseName":"UNLICENSED"},"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-73.785108,43.092696,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-73.785108,43.092696,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.6763698630136985,"count":584},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Saratoga Springs, NY"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/skidmore-college/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"d8a17c0f-cc25-4d2a-b231-0303ea016427","badge":{"display":"Best Colleges in America","ordinal":29,"total":1644,"vanityURL":"best-colleges"},"content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":true,"isPremium":true,"name":"Carnegie Mellon University","type":"College","url":"carnegie-mellon-university"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.2171},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":35250},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"1380-1550"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Alum","body":"Carnegie Mellon is tough, no doubt about it.

A safe small town that still is full of fun activities to keep students occupied on the weekends. Another great part of Bucknell is that it is a liberal science university.

It is definitely a very liberal campus so may be difficult for conservative students but this climate definitely challenges conservative students to clearly think through their opinions and convictions, ultimately molding everyone to be a more careful thinker, more articulate speaker and writer, and better global citizen.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2018-02-23T13:41:41.112665Z","guid":"887a2db1-f1aa-4ddd-b666-7a87fd8bcae3","rating":5},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":4}],"photos":{"default":{"crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/23de020ed1f1e711fce623b93d51658fd31845ef.jpg","MobileHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/ae7e258edc46e9db455df5d463c1be2ae7c17d43.jpg","Thumbnail":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/be9a22e0a8a992cf1aec55766e9178fe18c527dc"},"licenseName":"UNLICENSED"},"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-118.210783,34.126224,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-118.210783,34.126224,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.6056338028169015,"count":426},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Los Angeles, CA"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/occidental-college/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"a1237f7c-3941-41ce-ba42-687c276b73b4","badge":{"display":"Best Colleges in America","ordinal":47,"total":1644,"vanityURL":"best-colleges"},"content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"Lehigh University","type":"College","url":"lehigh-university"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.26},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":27478},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"1230-1420"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Freshman","body":"The school offer excellent education and resources for students.

It creates a beautiful community of bright students who engage in rigorous academic discourse in and out of the classroom. Though at times the administration is a bit self-serving and secretive, all the positives outweigh this part. My only suggestion is that they make good on their promise of being a liberal and progressive institution by becoming a sanctuary campus and divesting from fossil fuels.

Academics are outstanding. Classes are interesting and challenging, the professors are brilliant and accessible. Both semesters I got the classes I wanted, though sometimes your have to sit in for a first few days before getting in. (Common at liberal arts schools.) \n\nOberlin is a great size, small enough to feel like a community but large enough to keep meeting new people. Students are friendly. Some are quirky, athletic, political, or musical, but they are a great mix and you may be surprised at the friendships you make. There is always something to do on campus, and it is easy to get to Cleveland if you miss urban life. \n\nAthletics continue to improve, with several conference championships. Conservatory concerts are popular. The dining hall food is average, but if you like to cook or have dietary restrictions, you should consider joining a fun and delicious dining co-op.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2018-03-06T05:22:03.072255Z","guid":"7b628b94-f7f3-4fed-927e-71543287c20f","rating":5},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":4}],"photos":{"default":{"author":"sequencia","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/232068422ae94e1bf42cd7daf06f137ed8897c7c.jpg","MobileHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/305240c02b5d6f7eada3de2bf5ac141e00fe748c.jpg","Thumbnail":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/86f61778585249c0d5be198d4715b19b5a2d9a85"},"licenseName":"CC BY ","licenseUrl":"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/2.0/","sourceUrl":"https://www.flickr.com/photos/sequencia/567841903/"},"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-82.221786,41.29474,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-82.221786,41.29474,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.6582064297800336,"count":591},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Oberlin, OH"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/oberlin-college/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"33c56235-ee48-45b1-94fa-34556cdf84bd","badge":{"display":"Best Colleges in America","ordinal":60,"total":1644,"vanityURL":"best-colleges"},"content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":true,"isPremium":false,"name":"University of Rochester","type":"College","url":"university-of-rochester"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.3553},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":34170},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"1250-1450"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Alum","body":"My experience was great!
