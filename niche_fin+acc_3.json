Despite all of its flaws and imperfections, it is a safe space where I can explore and learn. The campus itself is a small city with features that make it feel more cozy than full-out sophisticated. From our beautiful Cathedral of Learning (we lovingly call her Cathy) to the spacious Schenley Park, there are tons of secret nooks that are perfect for studying. The professors, while teaching multiple classes, still make themselves available for questions outside the classroom. They are never too busy to stop and chat if you see them around campus; they really care about your education and that you have a passion for what you are studying. Overall, Pitt is an amazing college to attend. The community surrounding the campus challenge you and support you all at once.

It is very diverse with people from all around the world. The professors are very helpful and there is a common theme of \"the mission to education\" where every person is working with another to improve the educational experience for everyone. \nAlthough having large classes might be an advantage for some people, it minimizes the interaction between the students, which could be improved. Students don't interact very well in classes and rely on extracurricular activities or living on campus to get to know more people. Additionally, another area where the university can improve is the campus food! The dining halls don't present a variety of options, which makes it hard for some people to find what is right for them.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2018-02-13T23:38:36.65625Z","guid":"3eae44c9-11d7-4bd7-b6bb-a66916179cb7","rating":4},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":3.66}],"photos":{"default":{"author":"c-chen","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/1ffc5e24c53bf90b27f3233f41b9d3f8022122a6.jpg","MobileHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/1b1628fbaa3b25606429ec6955db55878bb4808e.jpg","Thumbnail":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/9c7e717a597fd715d684dca9de7a19daa3341afa"},"licenseName":"CC BY-SA","licenseUrl":"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/","sourceUrl":"https://www.flickr.com/photos/c-chen/6266767392/"},"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-72.249519,41.808205,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-72.249519,41.808205,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.5493150684931507,"count":2920},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Storrs, CT"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/university-of-connecticut/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"5029c3cc-a7d0-44a8-ac6a-215575af1342","badge":{"display":"Best Colleges for Accounting and Finance in America","ordinal":57,"total":652,"vanityURL":"best-colleges-for-accounting"},"content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":true,"isPremium":false,"name":"The College of New Jersey","type":"College","url":"the-college-of-new-jersey"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.4886},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":22421},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"1100-1300"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Senior","body":"I am currently attending The College of New Jersey and I absolutely love it. I lived on campus for one year and now I commute from my home in Northern NJ. Since my first major is Education of the Deaf and Hard of Hearing and my second Psychology, I have mainly spent my time in the Education Building and the Social Sciences Building. The professors here are incredibly intelligent and love to get to know the students as more than just a number. This is mainly due to the small class sizes, which I believe is one of the benefits of this institution. The professors are willing to work with you outside of class because they truly value your understanding of the subjects. I am continuously motivated to become a future educator by the professors that I have had and I can't wait to continue on in this career. I always feel safe when I am on campus and although the food isn't amazing, it is much better than other colleges that I have visited!

It is a great school academically and provides all of the opportunities a student could want in terms of good professors, real life experience and a supportive culture. Looking at the social aspect of the school, Butler has a very-tight knit group of student that share similar values (\"The Butler Way\"). Also, it is great to be so close to Broad Ripple and Downtown as this is obviously a big advantage both professionally and socially.

I recommend everyone looking into this college when they are applying.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2018-01-01T19:42:26.362584Z","guid":"9c3f07e7-6513-490c-b660-968f4077529f","rating":5},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":4}],"photos":{"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-87.928121,43.038766,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-87.928121,43.038766,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.5583377730420884,"count":1877},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Milwaukee, WI"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/marquette-university/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"0b914389-d868-4ecf-970e-60ac8353dde1","badge":{"display":"Best Colleges for Accounting and Finance in America","ordinal":72,"total":652,"vanityURL":"best-colleges-for-accounting"},"content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":true,"isPremium":false,"name":"University of South Carolina","type":"College","url":"university-of-south-carolina"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.6814},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":19913},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"1120-1300"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Freshman","body":"I am an out of state student attending USC for the first year of pursuing a 4 year degree. In the beginning I was uncomfortable with my transition and unable to feel at home. Through clubs and sports teams I was able to develop new friendships and life skills that made me feel more at home. There are so many opportunities presented to students at USC that all should take advantage of. One of the most important things that is clearly valued here, is academics. My professors so far have been some of the most passionate people I have met. A favorite course I have taken here has been environmental ethics. I took this course as a philosophy requirement and it inspired me to change my major to environmental studies. The professor and the course material inspired me to make a decision that I will not soon regret. I am more than happy to say that I am a student at USC. If someone decides to attend school here, I bet they will say the same thing.

There's a wide variety of students here that guarantees ease in finding friends in classes and other places on campus.  There's also so much to do every week!  JMU offers so many organizations and clubs to join as well as fun activities for the whole campus to join in on.  The reason I didn't give JMU 5 stars is because there are some small difficulties that arise for me throughout the school year. For example, it is very difficult to register for classes and get all the classes you need to satisfy graduation requirements, especially as a freshman.  Also, because JMU is a smaller campus with a growing student population, there are always very long lines for food, for example, because they cannot cater to every single student.  These are just a few examples of small problems I face on campus, but overall, I love JMU!","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2017-12-24T17:09:20.796054Z","guid":"679eb716-52a9-4dfc-b4f9-a74c15bfe27b","rating":4},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":4}],"photos":{"default":{"crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/4db870c879f0c6df1a1e3ba4ff31e994f951edad.jpg","MobileHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/3a5ac8236426e56afa157a1ec322d5838b863cae.jpg","Thumbnail":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/c349de8eee19ea6f15f0642d0d8b16418148cac0"},"licenseName":"UNLICENSED"},"mapbox_header":{"crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-78.871663,38.435332,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-78.871663,38.435332,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"UNLICENSED"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.7404946474713916,"count":2709},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Harrisonburg, VA"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/james-madison-university/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"8c7f93e4-7738-43ab-81e2-876c5fef63ce","badge":{"display":"Best Colleges for Accounting and Finance in America","ordinal":74,"total":652,"vanityURL":"best-colleges-for-accounting"},"content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"Loyola Marymount University","type":"College","url":"loyola-marymount-university"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.5387},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":40946},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"1120-1330"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Freshman","body":"This university campus is beautiful!

Being in Providence means there is always something to do or new to try. While it may not be the safest city, campus security helps make PC feel like it is in its own \"bubble\". Even though the food is not the best on campus, do not feel discouraged because the food off campus is always a hit! Dorms are mostly average, some are great while some of the older buildings definitely need renovation. Athletics are a big plus to this school whether you will be playing or in the audience. The school is strongly affiliated with the Catholic faith, however, all of the professors and Dominican Friars will be welcoming of all religious backgrounds. Also, PC may be lacking in diversity but I can tell they are trying to be more inclusive, especially when it comes to clubs and organizations. Overall, a great (and expensive) school.

Everyone (the students, the professors, the athletics coordinations/coaches) is so friendly, and due to Loyola's size, after the first few weeks of school you can't walk across campus without seeing a close friend! Despite the high acceptance rate, the academics are challenging yet interesting, and therefore worthwhile. Loyola's core curriculum, although intimidating at first, is extremely valuable in ensuring every student's education is well rounded (plus it helps to break up the classes for your major, which certainly helps me to stay focused by doing something different).
