The campus is small, so you get more one on one time in class. This helped me to learn more and made me more confident around my classmates. We were even division II National Campions in football this year! It really boosted morale and made us feel bigger than our small campus. Everything I experienced in Commerce made me appreciate the small campus and I loved every moment. If one can look past the isolated feeling at times, it is a great place to learn and make life long friends.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2018-02-26T04:03:01.217363Z","guid":"db1b03f2-bb49-43cc-93c5-a1f2051a3f7b","rating":4},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":3}],"photos":{"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-95.906913,33.243814,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-95.906913,33.243814,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.6611909650924024,"count":974},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Commerce, TX"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/texas-a-and-m-university---commerce/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"24f07ebd-4cf0-48f0-a059-d6b87dc82062","content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"University of Massachusetts - Dartmouth","type":"College","url":"university-of-massachusetts---dartmouth"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.7602},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":16898},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"910-1130"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Freshman","body":"The University of Massachusetts Dartmouth , is an amazing school.

Many of the professors here have gone above and beyond to accommodate for any questions and concerns that I may have. Going to an out-of-state school is very nerve wracking at first, but I am glad that I picked Elon. Elon has become my home away from home in more ways than one and I often find myself counting down the days till I am back on campus. Elon's curriculum can be very intense at times; however, I am getting an education based on the work that I put in. One complaint that I have about Elon is paying for laundry. The cost adds up very quickly and is often frustrating that I have to pay so that I am able to wear clean clothes to class. However, that is the only negative that I have so it doesn't outweigh all of the positive things that Elon has to offer me.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2018-04-19T13:43:25.478388Z","guid":"7f30ce7a-7427-4e25-bd99-8dd8702c2318","rating":5},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":3.66}],"photos":{"default":{"crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/9594d06e83a657e2511ddfd70641a213c2851460.jpg","MobileHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/42f3524b81e18c8a4e7a393354dccf1b6a43db44.jpg"},"licenseName":"UNLICENSED"},"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-79.505632,36.104149,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-79.505632,36.104149,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.5380818053596617,"count":1418},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Elon, NC"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/elon-university/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"709c9868-25cf-40d4-b94e-b2420a0dbbc6","content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"Morehead State University","type":"College","url":"morehead-state-university"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.8556},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":11296},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"840-1060"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Freshman","body":"I really do love this college but there are some downfalls to the way things work.

It will feel like home by the end of that week, and you'll feel at least a little ready for the first day of classes. I've been here for a week now, and I know already that i chose the right school! I chose this school for its reputation in nursing.  In addition to its great reputation, the food is great(lots of options too), bathrooms are clean, showers/sinks arent crowded, people are generally approachable and pleasant(although i can sniff the fakeness of some from a mile away), and the campus/city is very attractive and admirable.

Campus is very much together; you could walk to all of your classes. There's a shuttle bus that runs every 15-20 minutes that will take you around campus when you're feeling lazy or the weather is bad. The faculty members I've experienced the past 3 years I've been there have been AMAZING. I've met the most knowledgeable individuals at the Psychology Department. They are my favorite and most loved department at ESU! The dorms and housing are constantly improving which makes it hard to pick a hall to live in.

As a first in family minority student, I was reluctant to go to a big school not known to have a diverse student body. However, I’ve noticed the freshman student body is  more diverse than I expected and the school is not as big as I thought. I see many of the people in my hall around campus. The class sizes are small 15-25 students. The city of Oneonta is cute and transportation to the mall and other main spots is easily accessible. The RA’s are always there to help me with anything big or small. The freshman dorms seem to be the newest! The food is okay, it’s not moms cooking but there’s a lot of selections and 3 main dining halls around campus. Professors have overall been very supportive and helpful. Overall my experience has been very good. There’s many clubs and organizations that can help one branch out and meet new people, College is what you make it!","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2018-01-09T04:21:25.410091Z","guid":"f7a74e4d-846e-48e1-8a96-1e1e0069ea68","rating":4},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":3}],"photos":{"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-75.064186,42.466555,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-75.064186,42.466555,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.5116504854368933,"count":1030},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Oneonta, NY"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/suny-college-at-oneonta/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"d1aee02b-e2b9-4592-b7d6-c2f75f2c1945","content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"Rhode Island College","type":"College","url":"rhode-island-college"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.7469},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":9145},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"790-1020"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Freshman","body":"Rhode Island College is great! It's not perfect, but no college is. However, being a freshman, my transition from high school to college has been great. Most professors are super helpful and really like to challenge you. Campus safety is a goal that Rhode Island College strives to make their students feel. There is always RIC security driving through campus and many emergency push buttons all over. Which makes you feel very safe. The campus is small and beautiful and gives a home feeling like no other college I looked into. I am a commuter so I can not say what it is like living on campus. However the one downfall the college has is not enough parking spaces...Like ever. The school is mostly a commuter school which is cool, but parking can be horrendous depending on the time you have classes.

All the staff were very nice and helpful whenever I had any issues, which wasn't often in the first place because everyone was so helpful. Lots of my teachers seemed genuinely invested in how I was doing in their class and at GCSU in general.\nThe only thing I ever had an issue with was the mathematics department. Most teachers in that area did seem to care, but oftentimes I found they weren't able to teach the material quite as well as teachers in other areas. It would either be extremely difficult, with teachers going completely over my head, or very, very easy, with the teacher practically going back to basic high school math. It'd be nice to see some more focus on that area and to see it improve some.\nBut overall, this college has a very welcoming and warm environment and I'd recommend it to anyone looking for a good start to college.

SHU has representation from every state in the US and 70 countries. While based in Catholicism, SHU has almost a 50% diversity rate and welcomes people of any faith or belief system. Seton Hall athletics is one of the best parts of campus life. With 14 D1 sports teams there is always a game to watch and cheer on. The men's basketball team plays at the Prudential Center in Newark, NJ and they play in the Big East Conference. Going to basketball games is a highlight of the school year!\nOverall, social life on campus is awesome. There is always stuff to do on campus during the week and the weekends. Greek life is available on campus but will not make or break your experience. Like any school, it all depends on your willingness to put yourself out there - and SHU provides more than enough opportunities to do so. \nAlso, the FOOD is good! There are so many options and they change everyday.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2018-06-04T15:47:01.313883Z","guid":"67c0457c-4298-460b-8f22-c636e1cfaae0","rating":5},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":3.33}],"photos":{"default":{"crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/10c17ac338d092c6f9efeb8f4647806e6133a5e2.jpg","MobileHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/724f3858e89a297148ff496d8377ac95ea1db212.jpg"},"licenseName":"UNLICENSED"},"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-74.248753,40.742859,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-74.248753,40.742859,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.6006984866123397,"count":1718},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"South Orange, NJ"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/seton-hall-university/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"2c61d1b3-13b0-45db-87df-f3df02787d3a","content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"University of Denver","type":"College","url":"university-of-denver"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.5347},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":32940},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"1110-1310"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Freshman","body":"The extra opportunities at DU are fantastic!

The professors are very helpful as well as any of the staff here at JSU. Also, is true to say that JSU is the friendliest campus in the south. one undergraduate degree here, and I chose JSU for my second degree. There is a lot of diversity. There are many programs, activitites, research opportunities, clubs, volunteering opportunities, and opportunities for community service. Professors office hours are reasonable, and they will help you with pretty much anything. It is such a beautiful campus. The landscapers do a very well at helping accomplish this. The quad is also a nice spot to drop by for relaxing. Some people even hang their hammocks in the trees there to read, do homework, draw, or take a nap in between classes.
