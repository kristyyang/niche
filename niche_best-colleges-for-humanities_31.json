A friend of mine had Celiac Disease freshman year and I was amazed to see how much they provided for her so that she could feel comfortable eating. She told me that they even have allergy kitchens on both sides of the dining halls!

Friendly students and caring staff.  With the smaller class sizes the Professors are able to focus on the students.  They all are open and welcome visits to their offices.  It is a pretty campus, up front.  One major drawback is NO football team.  The Basketball teams do VERY well.   The athletic players are well supported by staff and students, but NOT given easy grades.  The food could be better.  There is a nice movie theater for students.  Could use a little more stuff in the student center to keep students on campus and not off looking for inappropriate things to do.  This university is located in a small rural TN town with nothing to do off campus.  Luckily there is a nice size town about 30 mins away that has a lot of fun things to do.   Many alumni stay in the area.

At least they have the commons food where the Burger King and Georges Cafe is. The dorms and housing is beautiful. I live in the towers and they are very nice, next year I will be moving into the sorority house though and those are also very nice. The parties on the weekend are good and most of the time safe.

I play soccer, so I started my first year a week earlier than regular students. My team and I formed a brotherhood and share a bond like no other. We had a great season which featured playoff appearances as a team, and individually, I started every game and scored two game winning goals as a freshman. My coach put lots of faith in me. In the classroom, professors were very involved and seemed to care a lot more than typical college professors. I finished with a 3.6 GPA. The campus is beautiful and small.

The college sponsors parties, concerts and other fun events throughout the year. As a Manhattanville student, you are near to New York City, Connecticut, Westchester County Airport, and White Plains. A talented chef oversees the dining hall, preparing great food that is also healthy.  If your child wants to \"party\" and waste their time and your money, this may not be the school for him or her.  And, \"no,\" this review was not written by the school, but rather by a very impressed parent with very high standards.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2017-12-08T22:15:18.867032Z","guid":"1ac67ac8-8e8e-4310-b46e-9902cb1c9acb","rating":5},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":2.66}],"photos":{"default":{"crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/3a44ffa739b1c9de9e500455db541b4b244afdb2.jpg","MobileHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/e2ac7b6888efe5e2557a0dd028adf61ea21c308a.jpg"},"licenseName":"UNLICENSED"},"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-73.718316,41.031054,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-73.718316,41.031054,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.414004914004914,"count":814},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Purchase, NY"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/manhattanville-college/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"e12f5d40-fc14-4747-b893-0aa7f41a07ce","content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":true,"isPremium":true,"name":"Fort Lewis College","type":"College","url":"fort-lewis-college"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.9212},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":17918},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"940-1120"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Alum","body":"Fort Lewis College is a school where students can participate in multiple club activities and sports. As an alumnus, I have had the chance to enjoy my college life by entering in the AIGA club on campus. This club is for graphic designers to participate in different activities that improves a designers skills and knowledge. Fort Lewis College also has programs like TRIO that help students improve academically and have resources for one-on-one tutoring. What I like about this college is that professors help students achieve in their academic skills by setting real-life examples in the classroom and in grading. What Fort Lewis can improve on would be having more financial advisors that can help students who have deeper problems within financial needs.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2018-02-18T03:01:56.625164Z","guid":"504cf946-b9df-4159-a8fc-87030fac6c4c","rating":4},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":2.66}],"photos":{"default":{"crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/971a1dff85c75e5d500e78e9e28f811dca3ffc09.jpg","MobileHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/3746340e765876783ed0fb3672fa5e7e23d4ad5c.jpg"},"licenseName":"UNLICENSED"},"mapbox_header":{"crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-107.867003,37.275428,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-107.867003,37.275428,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"UNLICENSED"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.656891495601173,"count":1023},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Durango, CO"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/fort-lewis-college/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"a5fdbf37-fb26-4685-bfd0-494d00dd336e","content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"Shorter University","type":"College","url":"shorter-university"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.6115},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":17447},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"830-1070"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Niche User","body":"The atmosphere!
