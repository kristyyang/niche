You really get to know everyone well and make lasting friendships. Most people going to Paul Smiths have similar desires and interests. This makes it easy to find a friend that you can connect with. Location is whar separates this college from most. It is beautiful. Yes, it does get cold, but you are likely the type of person who has been outside enough to cope with the cold if you are going to Paul Smiths. Academically you get to know each of your professors very well. With small class sizes and labs there is a unique hands-on learning experience that other colleges just can’t match. One thing I would change is the food selection. There just isn’t much to choose from and what is prepared isn’t in that great of quality. The library is a great environment to get homework and studying done.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2017-12-29T03:38:51.712814Z","guid":"0ca54b74-b780-4cec-ab0f-a5907ec1c945","rating":4},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":2.66}],"photos":{"default":{"crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/7121bd656d8fa017fa1ed810f1dbaefe0c1779fa.jpg","MobileHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/7f7a37f02d742ea52228436195bc5825efa4318c.jpg"},"licenseName":"UNLICENSED"},"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-74.253006,44.437366,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-74.253006,44.437366,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.6650485436893203,"count":206},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Paul Smiths, NY"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/paul-smiths-college/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"70a320eb-b307-4b8b-b13d-e5ec32973afe","badge":{"display":"Best Colleges for Culinary Arts in America","ordinal":13,"total":64,"vanityURL":"best-colleges-for-culinary-arts"},"content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"SUNY Alfred State College","type":"College","url":"suny-alfred-state-college"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.7199},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":14336},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"830-1060"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Freshman","body":"Decent food but only 6 places to eat becomes old halfway through the semester.

There's free tutoring if needed\nUNH works with most study abroad programs.

Overall I have been happy with the classes and living conditions.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2017-12-28T20:44:48.117198Z","guid":"cafe1977-fb94-4580-a22a-d87d2a2a39ea","rating":4},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":2.66}],"photos":{"default":{"crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/c8b5aa43cd68a0d1ff28bf772f2b3dc255bf42af.jpg","MobileHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/280dfd75257fb4f70b3ecdc3682d69394bbb400e.jpg"},"licenseName":"UNLICENSED"},"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-94.073389,30.044274,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-94.073389,30.044274,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.464195450716091,"count":1187},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Beaumont, TX"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/lamar-university/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"1efd3b32-c1ea-4216-b5f3-6b68b55c6728","content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"Morgan State University","type":"College","url":"morgan-state-university"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.603},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":15909},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"810-990"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Freshman","body":"Great school! The professors are awesome and really incorporate cultural competence into their lessons. There are always activities on campus to engage in and many clubs and fraternities and sororities. It is an open campus so there tends to be a lot of people that do not go to the school on campus and the food choices are very limited. On the plus side, the school is relatively inexpensive. I received various institutional  grants and scholarships without having to apply for them. Morgan is a great school for mature students as well and offers automatic admission for students who have continuously been out of school 3+ years which is always great. Downside is there are no daycare/family services.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2017-12-29T01:17:07.711499Z","guid":"288d32fb-ae6a-48d4-bf12-ee223e551a4f","rating":4},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":2.33}],"photos":{"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-76.584238,39.344235,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-76.584238,39.344235,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.298903878583474,"count":2372},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Baltimore, MD"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/morgan-state-university/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"520b28fb-64db-4443-8975-377ab81767b2","content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"University of North Alabama","type":"College","url":"university-of-north-alabama"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.5574},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":10427},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"862-1053"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Senior","body":"Great atmosphere, great classes, and even better professors are just a few of the perks of attending the University of North Alabama (UNA). First off, the atmosphere at the University of North Alabama is unlike any other! Seeing as how the school is placed in a quaint little town like Florence, Alabama, everyone is so friendly and you feel right at home. Unlike bigger schools, UNA's professors are able to give students more one on one attention by offering smaller classes, and students feel free to engage more, thus building their success! There are many organizations on campus that adhere to everyone's interests. From being a dancer as a Lionette in the Pride of Dixie Marching Band, to joining the Student Public Relations organization, there are many opportunities for students to gain crucial experience that will build their resumes. I adore UNA, and wouldn't change a thing about it. Did I mention they have live lion mascots on campus?","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2017-07-14T05:57:30.728011Z","guid":"00f6e25b-e83c-4f44-8067-ca825d2043b2","rating":5},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":3.33}],"photos":{"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-87.680999,34.80658,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-87.680999,34.80658,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.7764842840512225,"count":859},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Florence, AL"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/university-of-north-alabama/#scatterplot"}}]}
