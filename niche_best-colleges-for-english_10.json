You make good friends that you most likely will have multiple classes with so it makes it easier to study and makes class more fun.

The only down fall is that since they are a Christian school you are required to take quite a few in depth theology classes, regardless of your major.

Queens is a very small campus, it'll take you 5 minutes to walk to the farthest part on campus! The student body closely resembles that of the size of a high school (2,500-3,000) students. Queens is also a liberal arts school so here we focus a lot on the arts and you are required to take some arts courses because of this, but I loved it; it broadened my knowledge and forced me to take courses that I may not have taken otherwise. Because of the size of the school the ratio of professor to student is along the lines of 1:17, which is great because you are NOT known as just a number here, you are an individual that the Professor actually gets to know. It makes your experience better when you know that your Professor cares about you. If you enjoy truly being known on campus, small school/classes then Queens is the perfect fit for you!","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2017-03-27T23:30:42.679889Z","guid":"a05c4c87-4b5d-4d91-9c11-812f8209a19c","rating":4},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":3}],"photos":{"default":{"crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/4fcc168cf25c5c1ce850a03e16eb34c08a05786f.jpg","MobileHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/ddfa9942ddbe15172598d426c373c5f431b04ca4.jpg"},"licenseName":"UNLICENSED"},"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-80.832227,35.188929,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-80.832227,35.188929,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.579520697167756,"count":459},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Charlotte, NC"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/queens-university-of-charlotte/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"c5aa5e04-2d3a-45bd-8e83-4df976f79700","badge":{"display":"Best Colleges for English in America","ordinal":241,"total":647,"vanityURL":"best-colleges-for-english"},"content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":true,"isPremium":false,"name":"Hope College","type":"College","url":"hope-college"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.8441},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":27734},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"1000-1270"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Sophomore","body":"I am an international student.

I refused to research the school because I did not believe Winthrop was the place for me; however,  I toured the campus about three years later.  One reason why is because of the campus's size. In my opinion, Winthrop is a smaller Clemson. Furthermore, the student ratio is 15:1. Another reason is the convivial atmosphere. Winthrop's faculties are organized, easy to find, and productive. For example, the student center has over four different restaurants and the workers are nice. The staff occupying these places such as the recreation center, bookstore, and admissions office are welcoming, helpful, and friendly. Last but not least, Winthrop has the graphic design program which is my intended major. Thus, I have been accepted into Winthrop University and I am looking forward to finish in two years.

In the beginning I was uncomfortable with my transition and unable to feel at home. Through clubs and sports teams I was able to develop new friendships and life skills that made me feel more at home. There are so many opportunities presented to students at USC that all should take advantage of. One of the most important things that is clearly valued here, is academics. My professors so far have been some of the most passionate people I have met. A favorite course I have taken here has been environmental ethics. I took this course as a philosophy requirement and it inspired me to change my major to environmental studies. The professor and the course material inspired me to make a decision that I will not soon regret. I am more than happy to say that I am a student at USC. If someone decides to attend school here, I bet they will say the same thing.

Some downsides are the food (which isn't great) and some of the extra things that come with it being a small school. For example, registering for certain majors can be extremely difficult because of limited class options and there are less options for housing, food, and activities than on a larger campus.

The food is excellent, Godfather's Pizza, Chinese, Latin American, Sushi, Burgers, and buffet styled mess halls are a good indication of the different food at Creighton.  The dorms are a little on the dated side, yet they have modern amenities.  The older buildings really gives the place a theme and a warm glow.

It first drew my attention for being close to home, and I later found out about all the other great features it has. The small student body size allows for more one-on-one time with faculty. This allows for students to get more personalized feedback and assistance with academics. Also, Lake Forest does an excellent job of fostering student leaders through a variety of clubs and programs on and off campus. I feel as if there are plenty of opportunities for my voice to be heard and to make a difference at this school. Additionally, all the professors I have had the pleasure of taking classes with have been amazing. They are all extremely knowledgeable people who want their students to succeed.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2018-04-17T04:32:39.326071Z","guid":"6b769569-7a8e-4c18-9141-97f2f5ca761f","rating":5},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":3.33}],"photos":{"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-87.830777,42.250456,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-87.830777,42.250456,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.405727923627685,"count":419},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Lake Forest, IL"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/lake-forest-college/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"8a72c13a-3ea9-44c2-a121-7a777fbc0aa5","badge":{"display":"Best Colleges for English in America","ordinal":261,"total":647,"vanityURL":"best-colleges-for-english"},"content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"St. Norbert College","type":"College","url":"st-norbert-college"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.8139},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":24182},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"960-1230"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Freshman","body":"I really love SNC!  The campus is beautiful and so clean.  The people are all wonderful and unbelievably polite.  The academics are great and very diverse, with the teachers being very involved, even if they sometimes forget office hours.  I do not go to parties, but I have heard from friends the sober parties are very fun and they have a great time there!  I am no athlete, but my friends seem to really enjoy the athletic program here.  The teachers are amazing and they really add to the overall experience.  I feel very safe here, there have been a few reports of \"attacks\" on campus, but each time, people are physically injured.  The food here is delicious and I have definitely gained my freshman 15, but no worries, the new fitness center is almost complete, so I won't have to worry about gaining any more weight!
