At Purdue, students are offered great opportunities to participate in research, student led organizations, and extra curricular activities on throughout the year. Because Purdue is a research university, students and faculty definitely can develop a rapport that fosters a students growth in obtaining certain knowledge and skills. Purdue also offers many great opportunities for students to develop leadership through becoming members of one of the hundreds organizations on campus. Lastly, Purdue students can attend many sports events whether it be for the school's football team or even an intramural team game. Purdue has may eateries and study spots so people can meet up for lunch or dinner then study for upcoming exams.

From political to adventurous student organizations, to meeting the very brightest professors and students in your chosen field, you will never cease to be amazed by the unlimited amount of opportunities available to you. For instance, I am a double major in Government and International Relations and Global Studies and am continuously amazed at the amount of programs, events, lectures , courses, and books available just for students in those majors. Your college's department of Career Services will blow you away as well, they will provide any and all resources to ensure your success after graduation. Most of all, UT is a highly respected university in the state of Texas and beyond, a degree from UT will go a very long way!

Other than that, these two years have been great--go Badgers!","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2018-04-25T22:29:44.54926Z","guid":"701ee4ec-29d7-454d-8536-f1bf5f2334d5","rating":5},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":4.33}],"photos":{"default":{"crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/20f1bba0ea57723355da0460ab2bb9bcc14af618.jpg","MobileHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/930fd63b8058ceaab63b92570be1f8f8353fd793.jpg","Thumbnail":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/deb1b7c312c971a2585ad9424fb8ccbe1726b4ec"},"licenseName":"UNLICENSED"},"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-89.405356,43.073858,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-89.405356,43.073858,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.8197674418604652,"count":2924},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Madison, WI"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/university-of-wisconsin/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"f40e30c1-1cb2-4324-9c05-68e3c9685cf3","badge":{"display":"Best Colleges in America","ordinal":420,"total":1644,"vanityURL":"best-colleges"},"content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":true,"isPremium":false,"name":"California State University Maritime Academy","type":"College","url":"california-state-university-maritime-academy"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.682},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":14606},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"960-1190"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Freshman","body":"I like how theCalifornia Maritime Academy is unique in their own way from all other universities in the CSU system.

All classes and labs are completely taught by the professors, since there are no teacher assistants. In their first term, students take classes within their major. This helps students discern whether their chosen major is the right fit and provides immediate exposure to material that they will use in their collegiate and post-collegiate careers. By using the trimester system, the school gives its students exposure to a large range of classes and material. If one succeeds at the school, a degree from Milwaukee School of Engineering is highly respected, at least in the surrounding area. The school provides all of the necessary tools to find a quality job before graduating.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2017-11-20T04:04:57.981479Z","guid":"3cb493cf-0bbe-44bb-aad8-1f18c7ff2825","rating":4},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":3.66}],"photos":{"default":{"crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/fdeb1889469919313d17e6ba3629c7519dd1596d.jpg","MobileHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/9a21479099031e5c73df3c39d7fc50d995f8c4dc.jpg"},"licenseName":"UNLICENSED"},"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-87.907691,43.045364,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-87.907691,43.045364,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.5734939759036144,"count":415},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Milwaukee, WI"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/milwaukee-school-of-engineering/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"762669d6-eb9c-4ed9-bce4-a2f1c24b723a","badge":{"display":"Best Colleges in America","ordinal":107,"total":1644,"vanityURL":"best-colleges"},"content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"Michigan Technological University","type":"College","url":"michigan-technological-university"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.7644},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":16276},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"1068-1335"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Senior","body":"Michigan Tech is a beautiful, welcoming place where everyone is welcome!

Their engineering programs rival those of MIT, Georgia Tech, and CalPoly, boasting a blend of a traditional 4 year degree with a trade school environment. Students learn in small classroom settings (1:20) that cater to kinesthetic learners, some of whom have ADD, ADHD, or fall on the Autism spectrum. Freshmen are given invaluable opportunities building robots, satellites, and rockets in their first semester attending, and with the rigorous course load, offers students a 99% job place rate within one year after graduation. While ERAU has extensive educational prospects, this University is not for everyone. Students struggle feeling connected to the town, which is a retirement community. Even so, many ERAU employees are working with the city to build community bridges and bring more engineering businesses to Prescott for internship and job opportunities.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2018-03-29T04:01:45.820093Z","guid":"a795672f-46d3-412e-b302-fcb54eaaecaf","rating":4},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":3.33}],"photos":{"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-112.452285,34.615678,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-112.452285,34.615678,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.6611570247933884,"count":847},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Prescott, AZ"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/embry-riddle-aeronautical-university---prescott/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"ac9cfdaf-b7c0-44c8-931b-af5caa160f52","badge":{"display":"Best Colleges in America","ordinal":76,"total":1644,"vanityURL":"best-colleges"},"content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"Texas A&M University","type":"College","url":"texas-a-and-m-university"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.6717},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":15455},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"1070-1310"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Senior","body":"This is a large school, however it feels small.

There are some programs directed to making prospective students of color feel more welcome (such as Poly Cultural Weekend) but overall, people of color make up less than half of the student body. There is even less people of color apart of Cal Poly's faculty. The lack of diversity is also apparent in the town, not just on campus.  If you are coming from a big city to San Luis Obispo, Cal Poly will be a big change. Since it is such a smaller, quieter area, there is not much to do here, especially if you're under 21.

All around, it's my dream University.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2018-03-28T19:01:53.950799Z","guid":"053f6b46-001a-463c-918a-bb2b3715a877","rating":5},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":3.66}],"photos":{"default":{"author":"30791749@N07","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/fb90d2b3ad935c89ade7379fbae247b55fda1dd6.jpg","MobileHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/bcfdc0f48a7c27526977a21dfa677e69b4844f1c.jpg","Thumbnail":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/68d3568efbd5aaba40447846736fa48571b1d802"},"licenseName":"CC BY ","licenseUrl":"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/2.0/","sourceUrl":"https://www.flickr.com/photos/30791749@N07/11540284636/"},"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-97.361537,32.709568,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-97.361537,32.709568,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.85,"count":1460},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Fort Worth, TX"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/texas-christian-university/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"a92e489c-6479-4ab6-a7f5-da4b36f81f3a","badge":{"display":"Best Colleges in America","ordinal":326,"total":1644,"vanityURL":"best-colleges"},"content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":true,"isPremium":true,"name":"Liberty University","type":"College","url":"liberty-university"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.2438},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":24794},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"950-1190"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Junior","body":"Liberty University is an incredible place to receive an education.

However, from what I've experienced, it's been overwhelmingly positive. The professors here are all skilled in a different areas, which makes Foundation year a very broad and interdisciplinary year. Indeed, students who want to focus on only one area of study find it tedious, but I found it very eye-opening. After all, I got the chance to work with mediums from paint to wood, which I've never touched. One truly exemplary part of RISD is the dining: they're very open to all types of eaters, and are open to change. If the food doesn't cover a wide enough spectrum, then there are methods of contacting the MET in order to change that. The MET staff are very kind and friendly, always open to conversation.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2018-03-29T09:04:16.437004Z","guid":"b4194fa2-89c2-4a15-ba50-180c1fb093e9","rating":4},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":4}],"photos":{"default":{"author":"woneffe","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/f7f8cd4dd5a6cb929c475a4063377a4266243e93.jpg","MobileHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/73b237c1328616a2c9b3ffcd5b0f0a128961bce3.jpg","Thumbnail":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/efa21c864eada53983b699012757771cd3bad7a8"},"licenseName":"CC BY-SA","licenseUrl":"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/","sourceUrl":"https://www.flickr.com/photos/woneffe/4048957944/"},"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-71.407692,41.825935,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-71.407692,41.825935,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.7114754098360656,"count":305},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Providence, RI"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/rhode-island-school-of-design/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"56908ba2-0e9c-45df-a290-43d3a858a3d6","badge":{"display":"Best Colleges in America","ordinal":688,"total":1644,"vanityURL":"best-colleges"},"content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"Lewis University","type":"College","url":"lewis-university"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.5919},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":20232},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"980-1210"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Alum","body":"Lewis has come a long way since my wife and I attended in the 1980's, however it has evolved into a premier regional college.

JU is located close to the Atlantic Ocean, so students have plenty of fun weekend activities in a nearby getaway locale. I am participating in the Aviation program, which is top-notch. I will graduate with a four-year degree that will have me completely prepared for a career as an airline pilot.
