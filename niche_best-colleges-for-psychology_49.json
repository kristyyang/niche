It's a very good place to grow up or go to college because it's pretty safe around these parts. There's not too much to do here but it's just a good area to live in. I'm studying energy management and production engineering (EMPE) and so far I'm loving it and I just got straight a's for my first semester. Dr. Blair is the main professor for EMPE and he's one of the best people that you could ever meet. We have 4 social groups for students to join in; which are delta, kappa, sigma, and theta. Joining a group is a good way to make new friends, make memories, compete in sports against other social groups, and a good way to get community service hours. I'm also a thrower for OVU's track and field team and it's also been a lot of fun but challenging at the same time because this has been our first year. We have a lot of other sports for people to do here also.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2017-01-05T18:54:44.593199Z","guid":"4e2fd268-4bc3-4817-9858-07de9a0b22d1","rating":5},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":2.33}],"photos":{"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-81.5392,39.31236,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-81.5392,39.31236,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.5652173913043477,"count":92},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Vienna, WV"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/ohio-valley-university/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"73a6601c-3bf4-4dd1-8d36-89cfd3f2f3cc","content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"Manor College","type":"College","url":"manor-college"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.8906},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":16566},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"670-890"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Recent Alumnus","body":"I really enjoyed my time at Manor College.

My classes are really interactive and offer flexibility in your learning style.  I would definitely choose my school if i could do it all over again, the only thing i would change would the orientation offered at the school was somewhat difficult for me. Because my school is outdoor based and environmentally conscious, out orientation is a three week backpacking trip that I wasn't nearly prepared for.

I would recommend this school to individuals who want to live in a small town with beautiful surroundings.  Coming from a big city of crime and tribulations, this place gives me peace.  When I'm on or off campus, I feel safe.  The community has opened their hearts to the students of the College of St. Joseph.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2014-03-26T18:20:03Z","guid":"02b5d3ea-1260-41f3-9603-fe502cec02de","rating":4},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":2}],"photos":{"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-73.007033,43.599777,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-73.007033,43.599777,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.4285714285714284,"count":56},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Rutland, VT"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/college-of-st-joseph/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"abb753a9-321c-49fb-860f-f91355dd48d9","content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"Trinity College of Florida","type":"College","url":"trinity-college-of-florida"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.7067},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":19149},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"710-950"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Junior","body":"Trinity College is the best Christian College in sunny tropical Florida!
