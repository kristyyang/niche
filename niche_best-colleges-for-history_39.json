Although the tuition is high, their financial aid packages cover a lot of the costs. The campus is tiny, but it is nice. Some people have noisy neighbors in the dorms, as I did. They would scream karaoke at 3 am. Our school has \"quiet hours\" set in place, but they didn't always listen. The dorms have no air conditioning so my dorm was always hot. This could just be Assumption Hall. The food is always hit or miss. The Cafe sometimes tries to make fancy meals, but they come out bland. Other times they offer hand rolled sushi and it is delicious. The food is definitely overpriced as well. Lastly, the teachers. Some teacher loves what they're doing and love to work with you until you understand what you are doing. Other teacher don't understand how to convey concepts to students in a manner that is understandable. The class sizes are really small, so you get to know the teachers personally as well.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2018-05-26T12:06:20.707487Z","guid":"f7f3b755-d5e2-43cd-90b2-0e558278de46","rating":4},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":2.66}],"photos":{"default":{"crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/50cd8ad6a79a3f908b24b1eef182c511b41a3a7f.jpg","MobileHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/f03192df6ed14f508ab1f24f90449f9a08d806a6.jpg"},"licenseName":"UNLICENSED"},"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-72.730489,41.783028,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-72.730489,41.783028,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.437888198757764,"count":322},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"West Hartford, CT"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/university-of-saint-joseph/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"525c72f3-2373-420a-a7e5-c48d9086e0ae","content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":true,"isPremium":false,"name":"Brevard College","type":"College","url":"brevard-college"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.4216},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":20864},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"850-1050"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Freshman","body":"My time at Brevard has been filled with new friends, caring professors, and a wonderful education.
