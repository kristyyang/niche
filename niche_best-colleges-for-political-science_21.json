Although you're in a class of about 35-40 students, if you make an effort to talk to your professor and reach out, you will stand out amongst the rest.

So make sure you build a relationship with them - they may be able to write an amazing recommendation or get you a job after you graduate!

Class sizes are relatively small the professor to student ratio is about 14:1. Small classes allow students to get he individual help that they might need or want. The educational benefits of YSU are amazing for a same state university. \nAlthough, there are somethings I would like to see change. There are not a lot of students that live on campus, there are only three dorm buildings in total. It almost feels like a commuter school in the sense that there are a lot of students that just go to class and then drive home. Weekends are very quiet and there aren't a lot of parties going on mostly because of the lack of students on campus. But, there is some change happening! YSU is building new apartment building the students can stay in. There are three apartment complexes around campus, University Edge, University Courtyards and they are build The Enclave.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2018-01-24T01:32:35.918307Z","guid":"78d2a013-3d7d-4c4b-9ed7-008f4de5ba5f","rating":4},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":2.66}],"photos":{"default":{"crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/ec6d071a1123c50daa4893e11be6a754c68ade5e.jpg","MobileHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/54a7fa7d83aa7f5def609bf299c699913f1ec09f.jpg"},"licenseName":"UNLICENSED"},"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-80.646515,41.105583,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-80.646515,41.105583,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.4008264462809916,"count":1210},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Youngstown, OH"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/youngstown-state-university/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"cae448eb-a4c6-4e01-afd9-c2e8e8afb88b","content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":true,"isPremium":false,"name":"University of Minnesota Duluth","type":"College","url":"university-of-minnesota-duluth"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.7655},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":15664},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"970-1210"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Freshman","body":"At the University of Minnesota - Duluth, everyone is very welcoming!

Everyone is connected to a very large friend group - from the people in their classes, to former or current roommates to friends of friends - and I love that! I'm a really extraverted person, so being able to make lots of connections and build relationships is something I find a lot of enjoyment in. However, I will say one of WSU's greatest downfalls is the use of Graduate Teaching Assistants (GTA) to teach an entire class. I know they'll have to one day teach a class, but a lot of the GTAs seem a little unprepared for it. Also, off the GTAs I have, some of them have even taught lecture for twenty minutes and let students go. Professors can take up the full hour with one lecture, so GTAs should be held to the same standard. In all honesty, this is just a small problem I have with WSU so far, so I hope it will change as I go forward in my degree program!","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2017-11-03T22:54:13.895863Z","guid":"3d22924d-21f9-46d1-8e96-5bad0f6904f9","rating":4},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":2.66}],"photos":{"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-97.296733,37.716484,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-97.296733,37.716484,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.586053412462908,"count":1348},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Wichita, KS"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/wichita-state-university/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"090fbe90-f532-4e8f-b86b-45495372cce4","content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"University of Northern Colorado","type":"College","url":"university-of-northern-colorado"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.9027},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":13065},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"928-1150"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Freshman","body":"My name is Lauren Espinoza and it is my first year at the University of Northern Colorado and so far it has been blissful!

Although I am grateful that I graduated, I miss taking classes at TAMUCC.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2018-04-10T04:18:17.284481Z","guid":"67abdfb9-4a13-4338-b244-ac339a48584d","rating":4},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":3}],"photos":{"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-97.331933,27.718601,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-97.331933,27.718601,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.609271523178808,"count":1812},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Corpus Christi, TX"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/texas-a-and-m-university---corpus-christi/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"eb0e57da-6ba2-4998-a94f-bb36fe0f5767","content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"Tarleton State University","type":"College","url":"tarleton-state-university"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.5039},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":10615},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"850-1050"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Freshman","body":"Tarleton is a very welcoming college straight from the start. You couldn’t ask for better people, from the students to the professors. Very rarely will you run into someone that is impolite. The campus is very nice. There are some rough professors that don’t teach very well but they are outnumbered by ones that you will have an easier time learning from. The campus has many organizations you can join, you will not get bored here. Also, the president and his wife are very involved in student life and never hesitates to carry a conversation! Highly recommend this school.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2018-01-25T03:48:21.754921Z","guid":"7c644fa4-03fd-47e7-9e57-b3db921e96fd","rating":5},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":3}],"photos":{"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-98.22008,32.215665,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-98.22008,32.215665,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.7155555555555555,"count":1575},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Stephenville, TX"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/tarleton-state-university/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"a6b8fbbb-4ab6-4930-a099-4bb13c1a6c02","content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":true,"isPremium":false,"name":"Southeast Missouri State University","type":"College","url":"southeast-missouri-state-university"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.8281},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":11776},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"878-1136"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Freshman","body":"Southeast is a great place to learn.
