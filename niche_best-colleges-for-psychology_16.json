I was terrified when I first started, but today I am completely in love with my classes, my teachers, my friends, and the overall campus! My favorite experiences so far have been the community events organized by the campus. The first week always consists of different activities and events everyday so that students can gather around the campus, get to know others, learn about clubs/activities, and get food and school themed clothes as well. My campus has a block party in Denver since it's right across the street where music and food is provided, along with tables and tents promoting all the clubs and organizations available on campus. These events continue throughout the year and make it fun and exciting to try new things.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2016-08-30T21:31:58Z","guid":"f92e489b-57f9-4d0d-aef6-fe4da407dbaf","rating":4},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":3.66}],"photos":{"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-104.999181,39.74603,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-104.999181,39.74603,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.545918367346939,"count":1568},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Denver, CO"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/university-of-colorado---denver/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"c76bd867-9b37-43fe-96ae-1279d5f3875f","badge":{"display":"Best Colleges for Psychology in America","ordinal":398,"total":993,"vanityURL":"best-colleges-for-psychology"},"content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"University of Cincinnati","type":"College","url":"university-of-cincinnati"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.7642},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":19978},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"1030-1290"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Alum","body":"The campus of the University is beautifully crafted and redesigned.

Whether that’s through freshman activities, great professors, or just awesome, nice people, Concordia is extremely welcoming to everyone and anyone. Oh and I can’t forget to mention how awesome free parking at the university is! \nI would, however, change the policies pertaining to the hours that boys/girls can be in each other’s dorms. I think that this policy should be different because by the time we get to college, we are adults. We should be capable of making our own mature decisions pertaining to the opposite gender. \nThe smallness of Concordia is one of its positives and negatives. It is a good thing because of how easy it is to know your fellow students, athletes, faculty, and even the president of the university. The negative of the smallness of the school is that everyone knows everything, word travels very fast.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2018-01-03T16:43:38.630766Z","guid":"d8e0a378-269a-4587-8b87-0fb383cd5cc8","rating":4},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":3}],"photos":{"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-97.089054,40.914853,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-97.089054,40.914853,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.672316384180791,"count":354},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Seward, NE"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/concordia-university---nebraska/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"d2661dbb-1f27-4182-9053-51b4fb5e9060","badge":{"display":"Best Colleges for Psychology in America","ordinal":400,"total":993,"vanityURL":"best-colleges-for-psychology"},"content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"Arizona State University - West Campus","type":"College","url":"arizona-state-university---west-campus"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.7786},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":8692},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"960-1168"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Freshman","body":"I really love Arizona State University's West campus.

Most teachers in that area did seem to care, but oftentimes I found they weren't able to teach the material quite as well as teachers in other areas. It would either be extremely difficult, with teachers going completely over my head, or very, very easy, with the teacher practically going back to basic high school math. It'd be nice to see some more focus on that area and to see it improve some.\nBut overall, this college has a very welcoming and warm environment and I'd recommend it to anyone looking for a good start to college.

I am enrolled in Teacher's College in the Elementary Education Program. I have had the privilege of building long-lasting relationships with classmates and outstanding professors in this program. All of my education classes have around 15-25 students in them. I personally love this class size because it allows me to create more meaningful and authentic relationships with my professor in a setting where I can have more one-on-one instruction if needed. With the encouragement and help of professors and my advisor on campus, I have been introduced to the opportunity to travel and teach in England for the summer.

Without Ball State's professors and immersive learning opportunities, I would not be heading in the positive direction with my career that I am today. I am so thankful that I chose Ball State University to earn my degree in Elementary Education!","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2018-01-31T04:24:39.048489Z","guid":"6235b9f9-5f11-4a82-a535-43859d369e5c","rating":5},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":3.33}],"photos":{"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-85.408863,40.198942,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-85.408863,40.198942,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.5968968664435654,"count":3287},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Muncie, IN"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/ball-state-university/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"45aa7b3b-0391-423d-a852-650b682f137c","content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"Saint Leo University","type":"College","url":"saint-leo-university"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.6974},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":21296},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"900-1090"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Freshman","body":"I absolutely love Saint Leo University! There are so many opportunities for students to learn and make friends. In my first week as a freshman, we had an orientation week and the staff and students were just incredible. The orientation leaders loved helping and making connections with the new students that they keep all throughout college. They did many activities like color wars and taking us to Busch Gardens. Saint Leo also is very good with keeping up with students throughout the year and making sure they stay on track. The staff is always very helpful and kind. If I could change anything it would be that the school would have a football team. I miss the Friday Night Lights every week.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2017-10-28T22:47:44.815186Z","guid":"60c2d4c6-ec2d-46e7-99de-6365ca43f072","rating":5},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":3}],"photos":{"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-82.257287,28.336776,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-82.257287,28.336776,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.6538233550681682,"count":1687},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Saint Leo, FL"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/saint-leo-university/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"a5404b59-16cc-4545-a239-8bbe5e28f098","content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"Houghton College","type":"College","url":"houghton-college"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.7933},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":21518},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"963-1240"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Senior","body":"I have enjoyed the personal connections to professors and other students I have met at Houghton.  Due to small class size, one would expect professors to be more available to students.  Houghton professors go above and beyond in making connections to each of their students.  They regularly invite students into their homes, and they involve students in the work and research that they are doing.  One professor I know has been known to search for online deals on equipment that students need!  Houghton is a tremendous place to meet people with whom you will relate professionally and personally for years to come.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2017-08-18T03:02:42.717132Z","guid":"3bdf7248-a925-45eb-b4f6-91817da4fd5d","rating":5},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":3}],"photos":{"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-78.156882,42.426841,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-78.156882,42.426841,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.6750700280112043,"count":357},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Houghton, NY"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/houghton-college/#scatterplot"}}]}
