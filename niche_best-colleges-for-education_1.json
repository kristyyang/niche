Its campus is BEAUTIFUL; we have lush gardens and there are so many birds here, from towhees to even the occasional hawk. The opportunities here to get involved are almost overwhelming. We have this program called DukeEngage where students go to all parts of the world to work with communities through research and volunteer work. I will actually be going to Costa Rica this summer to help in rainforest restoratuon and conservation through this  program!But what I truly love most about this school is its students. The atmosphere here is not competitive but collaborative. I came to Duke feeling insecure about my qualifications compared to those of the other incoming freshman. But never once did I feel belittled or patronized. Students here want each other to succeed, we want to see each other grow and challenge ourselves to improve. Here at Duke, 'Southern Hospitality' is the real deal!","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2018-05-27T14:32:04.566007Z","guid":"8d7d7a19-d735-4b3a-bb8b-956045868832","rating":5},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":4.33}],"photos":{"default":{"crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/060a39c7091618b17ac4912d09653a075e5db302.jpg","MobileHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/221469f6158d96ba17f4d7425a31e5441d828291.jpg","Thumbnail":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/5566f81b753102ab38f93c2f1fc03d9386348966"},"licenseName":"UNLICENSED"},"mapbox_header":{"crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-78.94226,36.00159,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-78.94226,36.00159,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"UNLICENSED"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.827220077220077,"count":1036},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Durham, NC"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/duke-university/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"f81ccefb-aaf6-4ceb-be7a-7797d1698e57","badge":{"display":"Best Colleges for Education in America","ordinal":3,"total":756,"vanityURL":"best-colleges-for-education"},"content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"Brown University","type":"College","url":"brown-university"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.0931},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":25264},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"1370-1570"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Sophomore","body":"Brown University is an amazing place to go for undergrad.

While individual achievement was emphasized at my High School, I've managed to develop new networking skills with the principle of never working alone and achieving together.

Smith tries very hard to cater to vegan/vegetarians/allergies, but they could do more, especially for gluten allergies. Because I am so busy, I am not much of a partier, so it's a positive for me that Smith is not a party school.

Overall MSU is a great school and should be one of your top choices!","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2018-05-05T20:27:17.49387Z","guid":"74727688-4301-4279-a34e-c4402c0f5d27","rating":4},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":4.33}],"photos":{"default":{"crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/3c86cb5ecb796fb02f00131e78e91c570bb305e7.jpg","MobileHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/d9e1f794feaf7d40a563d4afadc590a1ee11aca1.jpg","Thumbnail":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/bfda4f1b300ee36d4f810daa740dd5acd682ae77"},"licenseName":"UNLICENSED"},"mapbox_header":{"crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-84.473639,42.72476,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-84.473639,42.72476,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"UNLICENSED"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.8049067713444553,"count":5095},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"East Lansing, MI"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/michigan-state-university/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"9d87a681-a420-4920-a729-3cfaa05b02b9","badge":{"display":"Best Colleges for Education in America","ordinal":21,"total":756,"vanityURL":"best-colleges-for-education"},"content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"St. Olaf College","type":"College","url":"st-olaf-college"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.4476},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":27284},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"1120-1400"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Sophomore","body":"As a St. Olaf student, I feel like there are so many opportunities I have access to. Whether it's research or internships or pursuits fo further education, proactive St. Olaf students have many resources they can take advantage of. The curriculum is tough no matter what department you take courses in. Professors have extremely high expectations for their students, however they do everything in their power to build your way to those high expectations. It can be difficult to find a study/social life balance. If you cannot develop strong study habits, classes will be a struggle. There are a ton of resources available to students who haven't established study habits and professors are happy to work with students. The open-door policy is an awesome thing to take advantage of. There can be a sense of a competitive atmosphere, but usually there is a stronger sense of community and camaraderie between students because everyone is facing many of the same challenges in an academic sense.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2017-12-29T06:15:09.010955Z","guid":"0327f163-663c-474f-aa4e-9a560bc27a1d","rating":4},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":4}],"photos":{"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-93.183633,44.462884,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-93.183633,44.462884,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.617862371888726,"count":683},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Northfield, MN"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/st-olaf-college/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"f7397325-1b91-4a7c-a3d6-eaa23fd294ae","badge":{"display":"Best Colleges for Education in America","ordinal":22,"total":756,"vanityURL":"best-colleges-for-education"},"content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"University of Miami","type":"College","url":"university-of-miami"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.3771},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":37424},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"1210-1390"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Freshman","body":"Coral Gables is home to the University of Miami, an elite university, known commonly as “The U.” With its perpetual sunshine and swaying palm trees, the University of Miami enjoys the cool ambience of the tropics, while also holding the title of a Top 50 school.

The amount of school spirit everyone has is unlike anything I've ever experienced and everyone truly is just so happy to be a buckeye. The challenging coursework and excellent professors make Ohio State's academic experience one of a kind. My only complaint about my is experience is, my dorm is very old and lacks air conditioning and study spaces. But after the weather cools down it's not a problem!
