I think the teachers provide an enthusiastic teaching environment, and it helps to transition the freshman from being in high school to a whole new environment: college. I love the shade provided on the campus, but I do think there should be more of it, especially with the heat and vigor the sun gives during the summer months of Turlock. Perhaps each graduating class could plant a tree to help promote saving the environment, and make a positive impact as they face the world outside of college! There could be a \"forest of the future\" to help encourage the students to graduate and to leave their mark on the Stanislaus campus.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2017-10-09T06:12:36.072878Z","guid":"eb5164db-4c25-4b93-82e9-1c0de5fbd407","rating":4},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":3}],"photos":{"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-120.852511,37.52577,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-120.852511,37.52577,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.5944609297725023,"count":1011},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Turlock, CA"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/california-state-university---stanislaus/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"f93307b6-206b-4b2b-b35d-82fb1988c784","content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"University of New Hampshire","type":"College","url":"university-of-new-hampshire"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.7586},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":23066},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"990-1200"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Sophomore","body":"Durham itself is quiet, However busses/trains run nonstop to everywhere.

There's free tutoring if needed\nUNH works with most study abroad programs. It's discovery credit system makes it easy for credits to transfer towards your major. \nFor food It's in the top 1% of USA. There's 3 dining halls as well as shops all around campus. It's unbelievable(trust me on this)\nD1 Aka sports events are crazy.

From the looks of my room, I believed i would've had the best college experience ever.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2017-03-09T22:06:22.973548Z","guid":"a274f32e-17b9-41f2-a37f-9c1828519a9f","rating":5},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":2.33}],"photos":{"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-78.88067,42.934199,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-78.88067,42.934199,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.412650602409639,"count":1328},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Buffalo, NY"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/suny-buffalo-state-college/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"e86b1196-1af9-41c3-b6c4-095f12ea1f0a","content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"Eastern Michigan University","type":"College","url":"eastern-michigan-university"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.7288},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":14268},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"910-1140"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Junior","body":"I love this school.  It tends to have a bad reputation, especially from where I come from, but I have nothing but great things to say about it.  Campus culture is very work oriented, many people here are ready to really earn their way to what they want to do.  Eastern is very community based, and that is shown in Ypsilanti, and the kind people around you.  Very diverse student body.  EMU tends to be too focused on the work at times, which is never a bad thing, but we could learn to relax.  You have to work to get the experience that you want.  Don't expect to pay tuition and love it - get involved, talk to your professors, do community service, look into study abroad, talk to your classmates, do research!  There is plenty there if you grab it.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2018-05-25T19:01:31.291123Z","guid":"5e5fed39-5d34-462e-9cae-0ed359833037","rating":5},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":2.66}],"photos":{"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-83.624499,42.245751,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-83.624499,42.245751,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.4503844745514463,"count":2731},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Ypsilanti, MI"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/eastern-michigan-university/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"8f34fbf8-4b19-48f7-afa8-2ce42d051179","content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"University of New Haven","type":"College","url":"university-of-new-haven"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.8053},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":31263},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"930-1140"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Alum","body":"Ujjwal Pruthi\n1.

Commuters are not as informed about school events, but I do believe it has gotten better since I was there.","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2018-03-17T18:57:56.11623Z","guid":"b3f93417-e4f7-4e32-aad5-59b25f7b17e3","rating":4},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":2.33}],"photos":{"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-71.437175,42.297289,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-71.437175,42.297289,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.1963746223564957,"count":662},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Framingham, MA"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/framingham-state-university/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"7a4cc6d9-0f0d-4384-98eb-f32f1d3c09c6","content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"Northwestern College - Iowa","type":"College","url":"northwestern-college---iowa"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.6553},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":22627},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"915-1170"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Freshman","body":"Northwestern College is a wonderful college with faith integration and a very rigorous academic programs.

There's little spots to eat around town and lots of hiking opportunities. The professors are kind and easy to talk to. The small class size is one of my favorite things because all of my professors know my name and we form a nice student teacher relationship.

Do. Make a Difference. That is the motto of my current college, St. Cloud State University. Here, the professors genuinely enjoy the field that they were teaching and want their students to succeed in it, too. Within the first month of the 2016-2017 academic school year, there have been a number of different events for students to attend in which they can meet other students, enjoy free activities, and have an involvement on campus. As recently reported on the news, my community has recently undergone a traumatic occurrence at the local mall ten minutes away. Eight people were stabbed, none of which were students at the university, and the assailant was killed on site. Since this, the community has really come together to work through this difficult time. Within the past few days, the school has offered many opportunities for gatherings in which students and faculty could find some light in this time of darkness. The school genuinely cares. I would recommend this school to anyone looking for an affordable, amazing college experience. St. Cloud State University is a school that I would choose time and time again. Go, Huskies!","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2016-09-21T12:33:08Z","guid":"ea2efba9-930b-41d2-bcdd-0d2cfc907a32","rating":4},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":2.66}],"photos":{"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-94.153,45.552418,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-94.153,45.552418,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.450623202301055,"count":1043},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Saint Cloud, MN"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/st-cloud-state-university/#scatterplot"}},{"guid":"b84535ba-be32-4f39-acdd-4511bc675a24","content":{"entity":{"isClaimed":false,"isPremium":false,"name":"Westfield State University","type":"College","url":"westfield-state-university"},"facts":[{"config":{"format":["percent"],"rounding":["multiply_100","whole"]},"label":"Acceptance Rate","value":0.7792},{"config":{"format":["comma","dollar"],"rounding":["whole"]},"label":"Net Price","value":15593},{"label":"SAT Range","value":"890-1090"}],"featuredReview":{"author":"Sophomore","body":"It's been very fun here meeting all the friends I have made and bring part of the track and field team as a thrower.

IUP has a strong network of professors from a variety of backgrounds and experiences, which allows for a multitude of learning opportunities.  The campus is absolutely stunning with its mixture of  up-to-date academic buildings, alongside historic buildings that have been standing since the incorporation of the university.  The university aims to have a very diverse community of faculty and students, which it successfully accomplishes through its various academic programs and events.  The university is nestled in the small city of Indiana, Pennsylvania.  There are plenty of restaurants, shops, and bars along Philadelphia Street to keep students entertained in the evenings and on the weekends.  Overall, I have received a quality education at IUP, and I would certainly recommend the university to others!","categories":["Overall Experience"],"created":"2017-06-14T00:34:38.38611Z","guid":"216f6226-49ec-497e-86db-e5d5160ea815","rating":5},"grades":[{"description":"Based on millions of statistics and student reviews.","guid":"0764a6be-7ac7-44d9-b3d5-310fa319f416","label":"Overall Niche Grade","rankingGuid":"fac7a671-4dc5-4070-a476-c59bdc010e15","value":2.66}],"photos":{"default":{"crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/7c0a4013a571b3a4a1264b3cb67be13d334effcc.jpg","MobileHeader":"https://d13b2ieg84qqce.cloudfront.net/dbc91e581f5249282986d93e1f6cabd86c38fca7.jpg"},"licenseName":"UNLICENSED"},"mapbox_header":{"author":"© Mapbox","crops":{"DesktopHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-79.159869,40.615589,13/900x471@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg","MobileHeader":"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/niche-admin/citg1y6rj00312inu917d7y1o/static/-79.159869,40.615589,13/400x250@2x?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibmljaGUtYWRtaW4iLCJhIjoiY2lyODF1YnR6MDB3bGcybTNhdDQxY3pkZCJ9.NQ0kRtM21uVhwbzjSAridg"},"licenseName":"© OpenStreetMap","licenseUrl":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright","sourceUrl":"https://www.mapbox.com/about/maps/"}},"reviewAverage":{"average":3.479651162790698,"count":2408},"tagline":[{"label":"TaglineFact1","value":"4 Year"},{"label":"TaglineFact2","value":"Indiana, PA"},{"label":"TaglineFact3"}]},"cta":{"label":"Will You Get In?","type":"admissionsCalculator","url":"https://www.niche.com/colleges/indiana-university-of-pennsylvania/#scatterplot"}}]}
